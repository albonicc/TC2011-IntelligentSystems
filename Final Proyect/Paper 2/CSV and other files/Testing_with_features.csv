1,"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,” NYPD sources said. TruePundit NYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.” The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. “People are going to prison,” he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. “If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

2,"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York wasn’t planning on being leader of the Senate minority  —   and by extension the Democratic opposition  —   as the Trump era dawns in the nation’s capital. “Do I regret what happened? Yes,” said Mr. Schumer, who was hoping to be President Hillary Clinton’s right hand as Senate majority leader before both he and Mrs. Clinton came up short of their Election Day goals. “Late moments at night, do I think what could have been? Yes. ” “But I am fully occupied with the job at hand,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview in his Senate office on Friday, just a few days after being formally chosen by his colleagues to succeed his mentor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, as leader of the Senate Democrats. That job, in Mr. Schumer’s view, is to serve as the bulwark against a unified Republican government led by his former campaign donor,   Donald J. Trump to use the power of the Senate minority to try to force compromise when possible and to stand in the way of Republicans when necessary. “We are the barrier,” said Mr. Schumer, noting that the rules of the Senate  —   at least as they currently exist  —   give Democrats there much more power than their House counterparts to hold the line against Republican policies they oppose. “If he is going to agree on issues like trade and transportation infrastructure in a very real way with us, we have an obligation to pursue it,” Mr. Schumer said about Mr. Trump, who quickly reached out to Mr. Schumer by phone after his presidential victory. “But at the same time, we have an obligation to oppose him on all the places where he tramples on our values, travels with racism or just dismantles things because the right wing tells him to do so. That is where we are at. ” It is a delicate balance. And Mr. Schumer’s talk of cutting deals with Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has already alarmed some Democrats who want no cooperation whatsoever with Mr. Trump or the Senate Republicans who sat on President Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. “It would be a dereliction of our responsibility if we didn’t try,” said Mr. Schumer, who munched casually on a frozen Three Musketeers bar as he laid out his vision. “As long as we don’t sell out, we have an obligation to the millions of Americans who are struggling. ” Those   Americans are at the center of Mr. Schumer’s emerging strategy. He believes that Mr. Trump won by appealing to the middle of America with what was essentially a Democratic economic message on trade and job creation. He is convinced he can leverage that with the new president. “We are saying, ‘Mr. President you have two choices: Work with us and you will have to alienate your Republican colleagues, or break your promises to   America,’” he said. “I believe that   America voted for Trump mainly because of Democratic issues like trade, not for Republican issues like tax cuts for the wealthy. ” Mr. Schumer says, however, that any legislation that can entice Democrats will have to be substantial and not be used to chip away at other priorities, or they will not hesitate to oppose it. For instance, he noted that he had quickly issued a statement skeptical of the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican and occasional Senate gym workout companion, for attorney general, and would be giving all nominees thorough scrutiny. And he said some issues were simply nonstarters, such as reversing Wall Street and banking reforms enacted after the 2008 economic collapse. “When it comes to repealing any of   as they say in Brooklyn, fuggedaboutit,” said the   Mr. Schumer, who also said Democrats would not cooperate in any way with overturning the Affordable Care Act. Democrats did pick up two seats with wins in Illinois and New Hampshire, narrowing the Republican majority and making it that much more difficult for Mr. McConnell to round up the 60 votes needed to overcome filibusters, or perhaps even muster a simple majority. “Even though we didn’t get the majority, those two votes will be invaluable in stopping Republicans from doing bad, bad things,” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer does not believe Republicans will be eager to eliminate the ability to mount filibusters against legislation, preserving a chief minority weapon. He hopes that any Supreme Court nominee can win bipartisan support, but if Republicans threaten to eliminate the ability to filibuster   picks, he has an argument ready. “I said to McConnell, you don’t come before this with clean hands because of what you did with Merrick Garland, who didn’t even get a hearing and who was clearly a mainstream candidate,” Mr. Schumer said. After an increasingly strained relationship between Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer believes he can negotiate with the top Republican. “McConnell wants to make things work and I want to make things work,” he said. “While we will certainly both stand for our principles and each side will respect the other, we can get a lot more done than has been done in the past. ” But it will definitely be a challenge. And it was not the one Mr. Schumer had hoped to face.",,891,24.75,36,0.30976430976430974,0,0,0,0,82.72507739174407,5.588539718169347,84.6505798728021,57.60580160580161,0.8058361391694725,0.025813692480359147,0.04601571268237935,0.028058361391694726,0.04377104377104377,0.026936026936026935,0.18181818181818182,0.003367003367003367,0.005611672278338945,0.014590347923681257,0.06509539842873176,0.003367003367003367,0.08080808080808081,0.006734006734006734,0.004489337822671156,0.015712682379349047,0.007856341189674524,0.09764309764309764,0.001122334455667789,0.05723905723905724,0.03254769921436588,0.06060606060606061,0,0,0.03479236812570146,0.016835016835016835,0.13580246913580246,0,0,0.005611672278338945,0.001122334455667789,0,0.013468013468013467,0.04826038159371493,0.003367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0.4837261503928171,0.001122334455667789,0.020202020202020204,0.001122334455667789,0.006734006734006734,0.04601571268237935,0.004489337822671156,0.001122334455667789,0.010101010101010102,0.020202020202020204,0.004489337822671156,0.052749719416386086,0.01122334455667789,0.01122334455667789,0.014590347923681257,0.012345679012345678,0.001122334455667789,0,0.008978675645342313,0.24130190796857465,0.005611672278338945,0,0.026936026936026935,0.06621773288439955,0.04826038159371493,0.06397306397306397,0.029180695847362513,0.08080808080808081,0.15151515151515152,0.10998877665544332,0.026936026936026935,0.002244668911335578,0.03479236812570146,0.10549943883277217,0,0.01122334455667789,0.007856341189674524,0.001122334455667789,0.002244668911335578,0,0,0.025813692480359147,0.1335578002244669,0.06060606060606061,0,0.029180695847362513,0.006734006734006734,0.03479236812570146,0.1447811447811448,0.1414141414141414,0.017957351290684626,0.03928170594837262,0.006734006734006734,13,0,23.375,0,19,0,20.5,27,18,29,11,25,26,0,13,0,89,20.5,84.75,190.25,89,,0.32636407348451396,0,0.46556496553651555,0,0.4145501361280001,0,0.43310332765620774,0.5015528100075709,0.40149162409079436,0.5194078002485387,0.29075287651080506,0.4823199289467043,0.49211838590759965,0,0.45470419013864133,0,0.08740486128161061,0.020132580407561995,0.08323103363614044,0.18684016695310582,0.18300297666764737,0.8131598330468942,63
3,"Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” host Sean Hannity used his opening monologue to react to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision not to proceed with a vote on the   American Health Care Act, which would have been the opening salvo for Republicans trying to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.  Hannity argued Republicans must make sure this doesn’t happen in the future and point to the flaws in the legislative process where improvement must be made. However, he emphasized the outcome was not the fault of President Donald Trump. “Let me be very clear here,” Hannity said. “This is not President Trump’s failure. President Trump went above and beyond and did everything in his power to get this bill across the finish line. ” Hannity went on to take aim at the media and the Democratic opposition to the bill but reiterated that measures should be taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

5,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Negotiations are underway to extend a fragile   agreement in Syria to the embattled northern city of Aleppo, which a surge of violence has  nearly torn apart in recent weeks, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday. “In the last weeks, the cessation of hostilities has been put to the test, and it has frayed in certain areas, and it has fallen completely in a few areas,” Mr. Kerry said in Geneva after meeting with the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. Mr. Kerry said he was particularly disturbed about air raids on a hospital and three health clinics in Aleppo, for which he blamed President Bashar  ’s government. “The regime has clearly indicated the willingness, over a period of time now, to attack first responders, to attack health care workers and rescue workers,” Mr. Kerry said. “And the attack on this hospital is unconscionable, under any standard anywhere. It has to stop. ” He added that “both sides  —   the opposition and the regime  —   have contributed to this chaos. ” Mr. Kerry said that he planned to talk to his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, on Monday evening, and that Mr. de Mistura would travel to Moscow on Tuesday, all part of an effort to restore a fragile   that was brokered in February, with American and Russian support, and is now at risk of collapse. Mr. Kerry urged Russia to pressure Mr. Assad to stop the attacks. “This is the moment to try to make certain that what everybody has signed up to is, in fact, being delivered, being lived up to, without hypocrisy and without variation. ” Mr. Kerry said there could be no “legitimate political talks” until both parties carried out the agreement  —   a full cessation of hostilities throughout the country and the nationwide delivery of humanitarian aid. “And yet one party is blatantly violating that agreement,” he said, referring to the Syrian government. Speaking at a news conference with Mr. de Mistura, Mr. Kerry said that the deal was fraying in some areas and had collapsed in others and that legitimate talks on a   were impossible unless all of the involved parties were committed to it. Mr. Kerry said that Russia and the United States would add personnel in Geneva so that the   agreement could be monitored    —   a declaration that left the unsettling impression that until now, the agreement, promoted as being of ultimate importance, had not been monitored around the clock by its sponsors. Mr. de Mistura added a note of reality, saying he appreciated that while Russia and the United States were developing an improved   monitoring system, “we need the political will otherwise we would have only a mechanism. ” “Well said,” Mr. Kerry said. Asked repeatedly whether he trusted the Russian government on the efforts to restore a truce in Aleppo, Mr. Kerry declined to answer. In noting that the partial truce had fallen apart in some parts of Syria, Mr. Kerry acknowledged what has been clear for more than a week on the ground: The relative respite from violence brought by the   reduction in hostilities has come to a resounding end in many areas, especially Aleppo, where more than 200 people have died in the past week, most of them civilians. About   of those deaths have been on the   side of town, which is being pummeled anew by airstrikes and by bombs dropped from helicopters, including on a hospital. But both sides have demonstrated a disregard for civilian life, with rebels firing mortar shells and missiles last week toward most of the   neighborhoods in Aleppo, in one of their worst barrages in recent months. Yet as Mr. Kerry carries out shuttle diplomacy to try to revive the partial truce, it has been renewed in several areas, but not in Aleppo, where it is needed most. The Syrian Army said in a statement on Monday that a temporary truce in the suburbs of Damascus and in the coastal province of Latakia would be extended for an additional 48 hours. The Tass news agency in Russia quoted Lt. Gen. Sergei Kurylenko, head of the Russian coordination center in Syria, as saying only that talks about a   for Aleppo were continuing. The sticking point is apparently an unwillingness by Russia to tell the Syrian government to stop its aerial bombardments on   areas there. Mr. Kerry, as well as residents and opposition figures, say the government’s warplanes, in a campaign aided by Russia, are mainly hitting areas not controlled by the Nusra Front, which has a small presence in Aleppo. Instead, they are believed to be striking areas controlled by other insurgent groups, including some backed by the United States and its allies. The United States is considering whether to draw up a map of safe zones where civilians and members of moderate opposition groups could seek shelter from attacks by Mr. Assad’s military, The Associated Press reported. It was not immediately clear whether Russia would accept such a plan, or could persuade the Assad government to respect the zones. Such an agreement is also unlikely to be helpful if the sides cannot agree on what constitutes the violations the monitors are supposed to be watching for. Even if   hard lines were drawn on a map, and civilians and insurgents not affiliated with the Nusra Front were encouraged to go there, the plan would face major practical problems, given the difficulty of moving safely within the city. Rebel groups may not agree to give up areas that Russia believes are held by the Nusra Front, arguing that, in fact, they are held by local opposition fighters and seeing the plan as a ploy to allow the government to take them back.",,949,27.91176470588235,34,0.3266596417281349,0,0,0,0,96.0102849731933,29.725397575185003,69.72617793165739,34.94204425711275,0.7955742887249737,0.014752370916754479,0.03477344573234984,0.03582718651211802,0.05584826132771338,0.014752370916754479,0.14857744994731295,0.015806111696522657,0.004214963119072708,0.003161222339304531,0.09483667017913593,0.002107481559536354,0.07692307692307693,0.01053740779768177,0.002107481559536354,0.004214963119072708,0.015806111696522657,0.09483667017913593,0.001053740779768177,0.06533192834562697,0.01791359325605901,0.04847207586933614,0,0.002107481559536354,0.0273972602739726,0.01685985247629083,0.10326659641728135,0,0,0.004214963119072708,0,0,0.005268703898840885,0.0505795574288725,0.001053740779768177,0.001053740779768177,0.48050579557428874,0.008429926238145416,0.01685985247629083,0.002107481559536354,0,0.044257112750263436,0.004214963119072708,0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.004214963119072708,0.0273972602739726,0.001053740779768177,0.012644889357218124,0.01053740779768177,0.02528977871443625,0,0.002107481559536354,0.006322444678609062,0.20442571127502634,0.005268703898840885,0,0.02528977871443625,0.0547945205479452,0.03898840885142255,0.015806111696522657,0.030558482613277135,0.06111696522655427,0.17281348788198103,0.06006322444678609,0.02528977871443625,0,0.018967334035827187,0.16227608008429925,0.001053740779768177,0.005268703898840885,0.01053740779768177,0,0.004214963119072708,0,0,0.008429926238145416,0.0874604847207587,0.10748155953635406,0,0.022128556375131718,0.005268703898840885,0.04214963119072708,0.12118018967334036,0.13171759747102213,0.002107481559536354,0.029504741833508957,0,7,0,119,0,17,0,0,10,2,52.5,25.5,57.7,64.8,0,7,0,139.2,0,195.4,332.6,139.2,,0.2116286328774551,0,0.8202551483661108,0,0.3946438965569824,0,0,0.2771863727725965,0.07123316455861123,0.6681360601601174,0.4944082464090813,0.6887347496420659,0.7130532010353601,0,0.5924021567288619,0,0.11701412239408204,0,0.16425689307330196,0.27958977807666446,-0.7529566721307815,0.7204102219233355,92
6,"WASHINGTON  —   Victory for House Republicans in federal court last week could mean significantly higher health insurance premiums for millions of people if the decision is upheld on appeal, the Obama administration said Monday. And much of the cost for those higher premiums could be passed on to the federal government and taxpayers, administration officials and health policy experts said. The ruling by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia would block the administration from reimbursing insurers for discounts provided to millions of   people under the Affordable Care Act. Without that money, insurers would have to increase premiums for many people purchasing insurance through the health law’s online marketplaces, the administration said. Judge Collyer said that the administration had paid billions of dollars to insurers since January 2014 even though Congress had not appropriated money for those subsidies, a violation of Article I of the Constitution, which states, “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law. ” The disputed money compensates insurers for the discounts, which make health care more affordable to consumers by reducing   deductibles and other    costs. If insurers are not reimbursed for the discounts, the administration said, they will need to charge higher premiums to cover their expenses. A study by the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that premiums for midlevel “silver plans” could rise by nearly 30 percent without those reimbursements. Many consumers would be protected, since under the law, they would be entitled to larger tax credits to help pay the higher premiums, the administration said. However, taxpayers would bear some of the extra costs. The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, estimated additional spending would total $3. 6 billion in 2016 and $47 billion over the next decade. The administration plans to appeal the decision in the case, House of Representatives v. Burwell. The judge held off putting her decision into effect to allow for an appeal. Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said: “We have a long judicial process ahead of us, so there’ll be no immediate change to anyone’s current benefit. But if you eliminate the   subsidies, it would certainly increase the overall cost of coverage. ” Federal officials say the Affordable Care Act gave them permanent authority to help pay deductibles,   and other    costs for certain   people who buy insurance through the new public marketplaces. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that these payments, known as   reductions, would total $130 billion over the next 10 years. But if insurers must rely on Congress to provide the money through annual appropriations, that would cause uncertainty in insurance markets, the administration said, noting that Congress was often late in passing bills to finance operations of the federal government. In court papers, the Obama administration made this forecast: “If   reduction payments were dependent on annual appropriations, insurers would be forced to set their premiums for the upcoming year in the face of uncertainty about the existence and amount of payments they would receive. That uncertainty would be inefficient and destabilizing. It would also inevitably lead to increased premiums. ” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said he felt sure that the administration would ultimately prevail in court. Republicans will “stop at nothing to try to tear this bill down,” he said, “but I continue to be confident that they’re going to continue to fail. ” Administration officials said the ruling should not affect 2017 premiums. The White House contends that the health care law, signed by President Obama in 2010, provides all the authority he needs to pay insurance companies for the discounts they give consumers. But in April 2013, Mr. Obama sought explicit authority, asking Congress to provide the money in one of the annual appropriations bills for 2014. Congress did not act on the request. “Congress authorized reduced   but did not appropriate moneys for it, in the fiscal year 2014 budget or since,” Judge Collyer said. “Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one. ” Nearly five million people, or 56 percent of those enrolled in health plans through federal and state marketplaces, were benefiting from   reductions at the end of last year, the administration said. Researchers at the Urban Institute also predicted that insurers would increase premiums for silver plans if they were no longer reimbursed for   reductions. Premiums for such plans, they said, would increase about $1, 040 a year per person, or 29 percent. “If insurers have enough time to develop new rates, they could incorporate the increased costs into the premiums for silver plans,” said Linda J. Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute. “But this takes time. You can’t change the rules in the middle of the year and adjust prices the next week. ”",,812,20.3,40,0.3645320197044335,0,0,0,0,96.34241325177285,8.298773604269297,57.80939749905267,38.940697233800684,0.8460591133004927,0.019704433497536946,0.034482758620689655,0.019704433497536946,0.019704433497536946,0.006157635467980296,0.1539408866995074,0.0012315270935960591,0.003694581280788177,0.007389162561576354,0.09113300492610837,0,0.06157635467980296,0.013546798029556651,0.0012315270935960591,0.022167487684729065,0.013546798029556651,0.12315270935960591,0.0024630541871921183,0.06403940886699508,0.011083743842364532,0.04310344827586207,0,0,0.038177339901477834,0.038177339901477834,0.10098522167487685,0,0,0.0024630541871921183,0.0012315270935960591,0,0.017241379310344827,0.04310344827586207,0,0,0.42980295566502463,0.012315270935960592,0.020935960591133004,0.0049261083743842365,0.0024630541871921183,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0.012315270935960592,0.003694581280788177,0,0.0049261083743842365,0.07881773399014778,0.01847290640394089,0.017241379310344827,0.006157635467980296,0,0,0.0332512315270936,0.19704433497536947,0.006157635467980296,0,0.027093596059113302,0.04926108374384237,0.14285714285714285,0.024630541871921183,0.013546798029556651,0.07881773399014778,0.15147783251231528,0.059113300492610835,0.017241379310344827,0,0.024630541871921183,0.11699507389162561,0,0.0049261083743842365,0.006157635467980296,0.0012315270935960591,0.003694581280788177,0,0,0.0049261083743842365,0.07266009852216748,0.054187192118226604,0,0.024630541871921183,0.012315270935960592,0.046798029556650245,0.10467980295566502,0.11206896551724138,0.0024630541871921183,0.0812807881773399,0.0024630541871921183,18,0,20,2,9,0,0,14,2,24.75,9.625,7,31.75,0,18,0,77.375,2,70.75,143.125,77.375,,0.38890101355948364,0,0.41421356237309503,0.06604088253131131,0.24138865261078873,0,0,0.3310923799080573,0.06604088253131131,0.46667936445312197,0.2538956746799614,0.19838868006955165,0.5288645858484092,0,0.34654620645552786,0,0.0858648911083368,0.0022194479123318076,0.07851296989873768,0.15882924122624498,0.24882629107981222,0.841170758773755,54

8,"SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam welcomed former Department of Homeland Security official Philip Haney, author of See Something, Say Nothing: A Homeland Security Officer Exposes the Government’s Submission to Jihad, back to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday morning. Naturally, the terrorist attack in London was the primary topic of conversation. [Haney recalled appearing with Kassam on Wednesday’s edition of Sean Hannity’s show, where they discussed the difference between “indicators that might help you get focused on the circumstances of an attack like yesterday” and “proven derogatory information. ”  “You can develop indicators in a situation like yesterday without necessarily determining whether they’re really proven derogatory or not,” he said. He cited the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Chattanooga as cases where “there were indicators that were seen by different law enforcement, particularly FBI, which is domestic law enforcement, and then my own former agency, Customs and Border Protection, which was our primary job Department of Homeland Security was created to help protect our country from terrorism. ” “The way we constructed cases, which is commonly known as ‘connecting the dots,’ was to put pieces of information into the system until a point came when you could paint a picture, either of an individual or of an organization because there was a relationship between an individual who does an attack or may do an attack and an affiliated network of either other individuals or organizations,” he elaborated. Haney noted that the London attacker was evidently known to law enforcement. “I also just read that they’ve also arrested eight other people, which is perfect proof of my operating premise that these individuals virtually are never alone,” he added. “This notion that we have of individuals that are suddenly radicalized, just kind of out of the clear blue, is really not a correct premise because as we’re now discovering with the individual from the attack yesterday that there are other people involved in some way or another. It always amazes me how they’re able to find this out after an attack, but it doesn’t seem like they’re able to manage it quite as effectively before an attack occurs,” he said. Haney thought this was a consequence of the limited “arena that law enforcement is allowed to operate in and how they’re able to respond to indicators that they might find,” not a shortage of resources. “It’s been the prevailing notion that law enforcement tends to be limited in their ability to respond to the evidence that they see lately,” he noted unhappily. “We’ve been seeing these kind of vehicle attacks all the way back to Beirut, with the Marine barracks twenty, thirty years ago,” Haney pointed out. “As soon as I began to see the details of the story come out in the media, the picture came clear in my mind that this is very similar to the kind of attacks we’ve seen in Nice   Beirut, as I mentioned, and in Germany’s Christmas market. ” “That’s another arena of indicators when you’re evaluating a terrorist attack. If you’re a law enforcement officer, that’s your first and primary job, to try to put the picture together as quickly as you can, for one major reason: you don’t know at the time of attack if that’s the only person involved. You do your best to put the picture together as clearly and as quickly as possible as an indicator of a possible course of action, a response to the terrorist attack,” he advised. “As an outside observer, I took the evidence that was being provided by the media  —   in particular, the Guardian  —   and evaluated the pictures that they had shown of the MPs, the medical people, working on the individual that had been shot. Just from that picture, I was able to make some determinations, kind of focus down on the type of person that he probably was. With my background, I knew immediately that it was likely he was affiliated with other individuals, either directly   indirectly,” he explained. “It looked to me like he was going to crash through the gate if at all possible, and the smaller wall stopped him from going through,” Haney assessed. “You put the picture together, and then you respond in a law enforcement manner from there. That’s how I saw it as I evaluated it yesterday as the story was unfolding,” he said. Haney speculated that law enforcement withheld the identity of the attacker for as long as possible to “keep the individuals that they’re tracking” from escaping the dragnet. He thought it was reasonable for British   units to “give themselves as much of a tactical advantage as they possibly can maintain, for as long as they can maintain it. ” “Likely, people will go underground because that’s what always happens. Remember the attacks in Brussels? There were individuals that were involved in the attack that were basically hiding in plain sight, right in communities. It took months, if not longer, to find some of them,” he recalled.  “The other indicator, by the way, is what happened in the U. K. with the individuals arrested on the street or detained on the street, for asking other people in a protest questions about Islam. They intervened and took him off the street. That’s kind of a variation on the ‘see something, say something’ theme, that if you do see something and say something, oftentimes you end up getting in trouble for bringing it up,” Haney said.

9,"Shakespeare biography has long circled a set of tantalizing mysteries: Was he Protestant or secretly Catholic? Gay or straight? Loving toward his wife, or coldly dismissive? That the man left no surviving letters or autobiographical testimony has hardly helped, ensuring that accounts of his life have often relied on “one halfpenny worth of fact to an intolerable deal of supposition,” as the scholar C. W.   once lamented. Only a few scraps of new material relating to Shakespeare in his lifetime have surfaced over the past century. But now, a researcher has uncovered nearly a dozen previously unknown records that shed clearer light on another   side of the man: the social climber. The documents, discovered by Heather Wolfe, the curator of manuscripts at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, relate to a coat of arms that was granted to Shakespeare’s father in 1596, attesting to his and his son’s status as gentlemen. Considered with previously known records, Ms. Wolfe argues, the documents suggest both how deeply invested Shakespeare was in gaining that recognition  —   a rarity for a man from the theater  —   and how directly he may have been drawn into colorful bureaucratic infighting that threatened to strip it away. The new evidence “really helps us get a little bit closer to the man himself,” Ms. Wolfe said. “It shows him shaping himself and building his reputation in a very intentional way. ” James Shapiro, a Shakespeare scholar at Columbia University who has seen Ms. Wolfe’s research, said her discoveries help illuminate what mattered to Shakespeare. “It’s all about trying to figure out, what was he like?” Mr. Shapiro said. “Anytime we can substitute something solid for speculation, that’s significant. ” The new documents, Mr. Shapiro added, also come with a nice bonus: they clearly refute skeptics who continue to argue  —   to the deep exasperation of most scholars  —   that William Shakespeare of    was not actually the author of the works attributed to him. “It’s always been clear that Shakespeare of Stratford and ‘Shakespeare the player’ were one and the same,” Mr. Shapiro said. “But if you hold the documents Heather has discovered together, that is the smoking gun. ” Ms. Wolfe’s discoveries began in the archives of the College of Arms in London, home to 10 heralds who are still charged with researching and granting coats of arms  —   arcane territory where many literary scholars might fear to tread. “Looking through the minutiae of the College of Arms is, even for Shakespeare scholars, almost unbearable,” Mr. Shapiro said. “We really owe Heather a debt of gratitude for wading in. ” Ms. Wolfe said she began wondering if there wasn’t fresh material to find there when she looked through a book edited by Nigel Ramsay, a historian at University College London, with whom she curated an exhibition on heraldry at the Folger in 2014. On one page, she was startled by something she had never seen before: a sketch of the arms with the words “Shakespeare the player,” or actor, dated to around 1600. A similar image with the same text  —   a copy dating from around 1700  —   has long been known to Shakespeare scholars (as well as to authorship skeptics, who generally dismiss as unreliable any evidence dated after 1616, the year of Shakespeare’s death). But this earlier one, from the College of Arms, seemed to have gone unremarked on. Ms. Wolfe started digging there and in other archives, and so far has gathered a dozen unknown or forgotten depictions of the arms in heraldic reference works called alphabets and ordinaries. “I just started finding them everywhere,” she said. Scholars have long known that Shakespeare’s father, John, a businessman and justice of the peace in Stratford, had first made inquiries about a coat of arms around 1575. They have speculated that it was William who renewed the effort in 1596, on his father’s behalf. The new depictions Ms. Wolfe has gathered are all from the 17th century. More than half associate the arms with “Shakespeare the player,” or with William, not John. This material not only proves “that Shakespeare was Shakespeare,” as Ms. Wolfe wryly put it. It also, she argues, underlines the degree to which contemporaries saw the coat of arms as, in effect, being for William. “It makes it abundantly clear that while Shakespeare was obtaining the arms on behalf of his father, it was really for his own status,” she said. Mr. Shapiro said he agreed. “All evidence suggests this was not about the father,” he said, “but about how Shakespeare wanted to be seen. ” Alan H. Nelson, a retired professor at University of California, Berkeley, who has contributed to Shakespeare Documented, an online project curated by Ms. Wolfe, said he also found her case persuasive. The new material, he added, “helps to confirm everything we know about the arc of Shakespeare’s career and the way he understood himself in the context of his society,” he said. But not all of Shakespeare’s contemporaries took his newly minted status at face value. Ben Jonson mocked his arms in his 1598 play “Every Man Out of His Humour,” in which a country bumpkin is advised to purchase arms with the motto “Not without mustard,” a dig at Shakespeare’s motto “Not without right. ” (Shakespeare’s arms were yellow.) A more threatening attack came in 1602 from Ralph Brooke, a herald in the College of Arms who had long been at war with his archrival, William Dethick, who held the title Garter King of Arms. (At one point, Brooke reportedly warned Dethick, himself a notoriously violent man, that the Star Chamber would punish him by cutting off his ears.) That year, Brooke, drew up for submission to the queen a list of 23 “mean persons” who had wrongfully been granted arms by Dethick, including “Shakespeare the player,” as Brooke put it disparagingly. (Shakespeare was not the only one given a lowly job description: a man derided by Brooke as a mere “bookbinder,” Ms. Wolfe noted, was actually master of the Stationers’ Company, the prestigious body that regulated the publishing industry.) Among Dethick’s records, Ms. Wolfe found letters from outraged people whose arms had come under attack, as well as notes indicating that some had withdrawn their claims. While no record of Shakespeare’s response survives, Ms. Wolfe argues that the others’ intense reactions suggest that he must have known about the controversy, and likely took action to defend his status. Some whose letters survive lived outside London, she noted. “They couldn’t just approach Dethick, as Shakespeare could have. ” Shakespeare may have held onto his arms, but the glory didn’t last. His son, Hamnet, had died in 1596. His last direct descendant, a granddaughter named Elizabeth Barnard, died in 1670. Ms. Wolfe said that a colleague at the Folger recently pointed out something she has not seen any scholar discuss: the wax seal on Elizabeth’s last will shows a fragment of the Shakespeare arms, just barely visible. “She’s dying, she’s the last in the direct line, and the arms have faded,” Ms. Wolfe said. “It just seems touchingly symbolic. ”",,1189,20.5,58,0.32548359966358287,0,0,0,0,90.68156853481368,16.0777824502383,81.3650126156434,1.596039677435314,0.8099243061396131,0.011774600504625737,0.03532380151387721,0.040370058873002525,0.05550883095037847,0.01345668629100084,0.21698906644238855,0.010933557611438183,0.02943650126156434,0.021026072329688814,0.08494533221194281,0,0.05887300252312868,0.023549201009251473,0.020185029436501262,0.008410428931875526,0.01345668629100084,0.10176619007569386,0.005046257359125316,0.07317073170731707,0.021026072329688814,0.04205214465937763,0,0.004205214465937763,0.030277544154751892,0.005887300252312868,0.0656013456686291,0,0.007569386038687973,0.0008410428931875525,0.02607232968881413,0,0.00336417157275021,0.07148864592094197,0.0008410428931875525,0.0008410428931875525,0.456686291000841,0.001682085786375105,0.012615643397813289,0.0008410428931875525,0.0008410428931875525,0.0496215306980656,0.001682085786375105,0.0008410428931875525,0.027754415475189236,0.017661900756938603,0.004205214465937763,0.04878048780487805,0.00672834314550042,0.0336417157275021,0.014297729184188394,0.04205214465937763,0,0.001682085786375105,0.021026072329688814,0.2060555088309504,0.005887300252312868,0.00336417157275021,0.02943650126156434,0.060555088309503784,0.0496215306980656,0.05214465937762826,0.011774600504625737,0.03616484440706476,0.14802354920100924,0.10176619007569386,0.0159798149705635,0.00336417157275021,0.044575273338940284,0.1404541631623213,0.001682085786375105,0.007569386038687973,0.00336417157275021,0.0008410428931875525,0.015138772077375946,0,0.0008410428931875525,0.04289318755256518,0.13036164844407064,0.07064760302775441,0,0.031959629941127,0.004205214465937763,0.03616484440706476,0.11438183347350715,0.11942809083263246,0.00336417157275021,0.03532380151387721,0.0008410428931875525,13,10,101.75,1.675,13,6,4,19.025,7,61.125,30.975,9,26.875,0,13,0,97.85,16,153.9,264.75,97.85,,0.27625029819786723,0.22696955407408304,0.7492152233854581,0.04687442360394592,0.27625029819786723,0.1497799256148726,0.10510060395752727,0.35839577748369206,0.17048731694236688,0.6421787899939462,0.47629099003245734,0.20901664002472214,0.44105261819692376,0,0.4421968996752335,0,0.07076478032905442,0.0115711444585066,0.11129994576026035,0.1914662809618514,-0.6994604930770421,0.8085337190381486,71
10,"MEXICO CITY  —   More than a dozen conspirators gathered at the headquarters of the Honduran National Police just after 9:30 p. m. One of them clicked open a briefcase, and bundles of American dollars were distributed among the police officers  —   payment for the next day’s hit job. After everyone else filed out of the room, the three   officers stayed behind to make a call. “Keep watch over the news tomorrow, sir,” one of them said, according to case files gathered by Honduran investigators. “We’ll do it all in the morning, good night, sir. ” They kept their word. A day later, on Dec. 8, 2009, the top antidrug official in Honduras  —   the retired general Julián Arístides González Irías  —   dropped off his daughter at school and was heading to work when he found his usual route blocked. A motorcycle carrying two men pulled up to his Nissan SUV. The one riding at the back pulled out a gun, killing the general. Outrage at the assassination swept Honduras. The country was still in turmoil after the coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya and turned Honduras into an international outcast. In a country riddled with corruption and division, the retired general was distinguished for his rectitude and efficiency. The authorities promised a swift investigation. But the case quickly went cold. At least that is how it appeared to the public. Behind the scenes, according to the case files, the police investigators took just three weeks to solve the murder. The chief suspects were a cell of   police commanders working    with drug traffickers. The conspiracy reached all the way to the chief of police. The man at the other end of that evening’s phone call was Winter Blanco, the head of a drug cartel based on the Caribbean coast, according to the investigators’ files. Five months earlier, the antidrug czar had foiled the trafficker’s plan to use the police to steal 143 kilograms of cocaine from a rival. The assassination was payback, investigators concluded. Two years later, the antidrug czar’s top adviser, Alfredo Landaverde Hernández, was assassinated in exactly the same way, days after he publicly accused police commanders of allowing criminal gangs to infiltrate the police force. Once again, an investigation concluded that the chief suspects were the same commanders, aided by   officers. A full report was sent to the police chief. But in public, the case remained unsolved. Now, the details of the investigations  —   witness testimony, descriptions of videos, and phone call records  —   are emerging in Honduras, shaking the country once again. In terse language, the documents paint a chilling portrait of impunity at the very top of Honduras’s police hierarchy: the unchallenged power to carry out assassinations and force a   of the investigation. The suspicion that the police were part of the murders has long nagged at Hondurans. But with the release of the case files  —   parts of which were published in the Honduran press before being obtained by The New York Times  —   the country is now confronted with a glaring example of   government corruption and collusion with drug traffickers. The revelations come at a pivotal time in Honduras, just as an international commission backed by the Organization of American States is setting up in the country to help investigate corruption. At the same time, the Obama administration is in the process of sending about $750 million in aid to the region, hoping to address the chronic violence and lack of opportunity that has fueled a mass exodus of desperate people to the United States. The effort to suppress the results of two of the country’s most   murder cases came to light only this month, when the newspaper El Heraldo revealed parts of the investigation’s conclusions and published excerpts from the files, without naming any of the most powerful suspects. Since then, the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, has vowed a mass purge of the police force in response to the evidence, which helps peel back the layers covering the deeply entrenched networks of corruption feeding the country’s violence and poverty. Last year, Oscar Chinchilla, the Honduran attorney general, asked the United States for help in solving the assassinations and Washington provided advisers, Joseph Crook, a State Department spokesman, said. But the newly obtained case files point to a  . They include cover pages from the inspector general’s office of the Security Ministry, which oversees the National Police. So if Mr. Chinchilla carries out a   investigation to show that the government is serious about fighting corruption, it could end up ensnaring some of the president’s allies in the National Party, which has been in office since the beginning of 2010. “There was a type of pact of silence,” said Thelma Mejía, a Honduran journalist. “These files passed through various police chiefs and they did nothing. They were known by various security ministers and they did nothing. ” The early fallout of the scandal is beginning. Foreign Minister Arturo Corrales, who had also served as the country’s security minister, resigned late Thursday. The first announcements of police firings are expected as early as this weekend. A civilian commission in charge of weeding out corrupt officers has asked for background on the nine   active generals in the police force, including José Ricardo Ramírez del Cid, a former police chief in 2011 who is named in the case files as the mastermind behind the assassinations. According to the documents, Mr. Ramírez del Cid was one of the three who stayed behind the night before the antidrug czar was killed in 2009 to place the call to the drug lord. Another was José Luis Muñoz Licona, who was appointed police chief in 2010. In interviews broadcast after the El Heraldo report, both officials denied any involvement in the assassinations. So did the police chief at the time of the antidrug czar’s killing, Salomón Escoto Salinas, who is also named in the documents. The case files leave little doubt that inside the police, at least, the results of the investigation were known. In May 2012, an official in the inspector general’s office sent a copy of documents to the police chief at the time, Juan Carlos Bonilla, noting that he was acting under the orders of the security minister. At the end of 2013, Mr. Bonilla’s replacement as police chief, Ramón Sabillón Pineda, ordered special guards to protect the case files on both assassinations, as well as documents on other   killings. In remarks to the Honduran news media, four of the security ministers in office since 2009 said that they were not aware of the documents. The fifth refused to comment. Washington will be watching the police purge closely. It spent millions of dollars on the last effort to overhaul the Honduran police, which began in 2011, before finally giving up two years later when it was clear that only a handful of officers had been fired. “Despite good intentions, I think our own officials, especially in the past, have sometimes been naïve in the way they have supported the Honduran government’s actions and inactions,” Senator Patrick Leahy, who follows events in Honduras closely, said in written responses to questions. Mr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, successfully pressed Congress to impose human rights and anticorruption conditions on aid to Central American governments this year. “There is no doubt that our aid is well intentioned,” he wrote. “But despite some arrests of drug traffickers we’ve seen no real improvement in the Honduran justice system. ” And, he promised: “It is not going to be business as usual. We can’t keep throwing money away. ” The current Honduran president, Mr. Hernández, has had his own approach to police corruption, creating a military police force that has supplanted much of the National Police force on the ground. The coming police purge is likely to strengthen its power. The international anticorruption commission sponsored by the Organization of American States arrives this week to begin its work. Known by its Spanish initials, Maccih, it is a response to months of anticorruption protests last year across the country. The demonstrators, who marched at dusk bearing torches in a challenge to the president, demanded a prosecutors’ commission modeled after the one in neighboring Guatemala, which uncovered a customs bribery ring that brought down that country’s president last year. Mr. Hernández resisted an accord that would create a panel with the same powers, and the commission he agreed to will not have independent investigatory authority. But the president may find that his control is limited. In an interview, the director of the incoming group said that it would be up to his team, not the Honduran government, to choose the cases it will work on alongside Honduran prosecutors. “There should be no doubt that the mission will be involved in cases where there are networks of corruption that harm the country,” said Juan Jiménez Mayor, the former Peruvian justice minister who is leading the commission. Within days, the commission will start work on its first case, the assassination last month of Berta Cáceres, a prominent environmental and indigenous rights activist who was fighting a powerful Honduran company over a dam project on community land. Facing an international uproar, the government turned to the commission for help. Even Hondurans who had been skeptical of the limits on the commission were hopeful that it will ultimately lead to widespread investigation into the police and their protectors. “It is a special time in the country,” said Mario Díaz, a judge and president of the Association of Judges for Democracy, a group that has been critical of the Hernández government. “A lot of expectations have been generated. ”",,1611,20.92207792207792,77,0.35630043451272503,0,0,0,0,99,28.704455479688246,67.69078655670835,25.774193548387096,0.7939168218497827,0.020484171322160148,0.03972687771570453,0.02110490378646803,0.035381750465549346,0.012414649286157667,0.148975791433892,0.008690254500310366,0.004345127250155183,0.01303538175046555,0.13283674736188703,0,0.055865921787709494,0.004965859714463066,0.0006207324643078833,0.0186219739292365,0.006207324643078833,0.06455617628801986,0.00186219739292365,0.0633147113594041,0.024208566108007448,0.028553693358162633,0,0.009931719428926133,0.012414649286157667,0.006207324643078833,0.12166356300434512,0,0.0006207324643078833,0.002482929857231533,0.0006207324643078833,0,0.011793916821849782,0.0521415270018622,0.0012414649286157666,0.0012414649286157666,0.44382371198013654,0.0037243947858473,0.00931098696461825,0.00186219739292365,0.0006207324643078833,0.038485412787088766,0.0012414649286157666,0.0006207324643078833,0.013656114214773432,0.01303538175046555,0.0031036623215394167,0.014276846679081317,0.013656114214773432,0.0186219739292365,0.006828057107386716,0.01738050900062073,0,0.0012414649286157666,0.021725636250775917,0.18435754189944134,0.00558659217877095,0,0.01738050900062073,0.051520794537554315,0.08504034761018,0.0186219739292365,0.01738050900062073,0.08628181253879579,0.15518311607697083,0.057107386716325266,0.01303538175046555,0,0.013656114214773432,0.16387337057728119,0.004965859714463066,0.00558659217877095,0.008069522036002483,0.0006207324643078833,0.00558659217877095,0,0,0.008069522036002483,0.06269397889509622,0.09124767225325885,0,0.012414649286157667,0.006828057107386716,0.057107386716325266,0.1042830540037244,0.10117939168218498,0.0031036623215394167,0.06269397889509622,0,27,0,191.725,0,5,1,14,17,3.83,92.35,50,7,20,0,27,0,103.66,17,281.35,389.01000000000005,103.66,,0.4075912589381301,0,0.8300939437967181,0,0.11301265260956161,0.02484914473079738,0.26294618479892884,0.3022607302892501,0.08891915547179899,0.7017859360181807,0.5602690760053559,0.1513748062943529,0.33759357439819593,0,0.33759357439819593,0,0.05490437020990355,0.009004189596453408,0.14901933782130392,0.2060423408774318,-0.8649288066525049,0.7939576591225682,112
11,"SEATTLE  —   Laurie Speakman is passionate about moose meat. Partly it is the flavor of the meat, which to her is milder than beef, and great on the barbecue. What matters even more, she said, is moose meat for charity. When a moose weighing half a ton or more is killed on a highway on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage  —   something that can easily happen 125 times a year in that part of the state  —   Ms. Speakman gets the call. As a volunteer with the Alaska Moose Federation, she goes to the scene, winches the carcass onto her truck and delivers it to hungry families or religious and civic groups on a waiting list, which then butcher and distribute the meat. “I work my life around roadkill,” said Ms. Speakman, 45, whose Facebook page declares her alter ego, Laurie the Moose Lady. “My heart and soul is into this because people are getting fed. ” So it irks her, she said, when moose go missing. Under state law, animals struck and killed on Alaska’s highways are state property and may be handled only by authorized groups like the federation. But illegal carcass harvesting is occurring with increasing frequency in Alaska, said the group’s executive director, Don Dyer, who just last week stumbled upon evidence that pointed to moose theft. “This last Sunday about 3 o’clock in the morning, we got a call, and we got out there and someone had cut an entire shoulder out of a moose,” Mr. Dyer said in a telephone interview. “Some people out there say, ‘Well, it’s just roadkill,’ and if they’re hungry, they’re entitled to it, but the fact of the matter is that when somebody steals a whole moose, it impacts a lot of people. ” The goal of distributing meat from animals killed on the road is not new in Alaska, but before the creation of the federation in 2002, that meant butchering the animal where it died. The work could take a team two or three hours, cutting up 250 to 300 pounds of meat or more, sometimes in dangerous traffic and brutal weather. Transport by the federation’s drivers  —   there are now six, including Ms. Speakman  —   cleared crash sites faster and saved time and money for state troopers. Roadkill’s power as a punch line for   comedians, politicians and songwriters probably dates to the early days of the automobile. But harvesting food from the highway is increasingly earning some respect beyond Alaska. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, for example, the advocacy group better known by its acronym, PETA, has endorsed the harvest of animals killed on the road as a more ethical and humane way to get meat than through commercial agriculture practices that use feedlots and slaughterhouses. In a statement, the group said, “If the state is going to provide the needy with animal carcasses rather than doing the right thing by serving healthy   food, roadkill is a superior option. ” About 20 states  —   including Florida, Vermont, Colorado and Illinois  —   allow some legal taking of wild meat killed by accident, according to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, which changed its rules last month to allow the practice. In most of the United States, deer are by far the most likely animals to be hit by a vehicle. State Farm Insurance estimates that more than 1. 2 million deer, elk and moose  —   mostly deer  —   were struck in 2015 in the United States, with West Virginia being statistically the most dangerous place to be an ungulate crossing the road. And at least one academic who has studied the issue said he believed evolution was changing the behavior of animal populations, which have learned to adapt to the ribbons of highway and the shiny machines that roar past day and night. “There is just less space for creatures, and they have in some cases been changed,” said Roger M. Knutson, a retired professor of biology and the author of the book “Flattened Fauna: A Field Guide to Common Animals of Roads, Streets, and Highways. ” Mr. Knutson’s book, first published in the   quotes, for example, a study of hedgehogs  —   a kind of animal famous for curling up into a ball when threatened. When the animals come to highways now, the study said, they have learned to run instead. The legal wrinkles of harvesting animals killed on the road vary. In Idaho, for example, people are required to call a wildlife worker or law enforcement official to kill an injured animal before it can be taken. In Washington, salvagers can load a dead deer or elk into their vehicle and drive away, but they must contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife within 24 hours to get a permit. Ms. Speakman said she feels loved by those she helps. Several local organizations and Alaska Native tribal groups regularly give her gas cards to help out. “I’ve had a few charities that made me breakfast. Some will give me coffee. I kind of get spoiled a little bit,” she said. But she draws the line at taking any meat for herself. “I’ve had a couple of charities offer some to me, and I will not accept it  —   there are needy families out there, and I don’t want to take away from them. ” She gets her moose meat by hunting. And she is thinking of eventually writing her own   cookbook. “I’ve got some recipes,” she said.",,913,22.26829268292683,41,0.28806133625410735,0,0,0,0,93.55568451679478,15.444235817729792,69.670943514317,25.774193548387096,0.791894852135816,0.012048192771084338,0.040525739320920046,0.03504928806133625,0.03504928806133625,0.018619934282584884,0.1741511500547645,0.009857612267250822,0.001095290251916758,0.01533406352683461,0.09309967141292443,0,0.056955093099671415,0.03066812705366922,0.0032858707557502738,0.01095290251916758,0.0032858707557502738,0.07886089813800658,0.001095290251916758,0.07119386637458927,0.025191675794085433,0.06133625410733844,0,0.01095290251916758,0.024096385542168676,0.0065717415115005475,0.07776560788608981,0,0.002190580503833516,0.001095290251916758,0.025191675794085433,0,0.0065717415115005475,0.038335158817086525,0.001095290251916758,0.001095290251916758,0.4556407447973713,0.002190580503833516,0.01642935377875137,0.002190580503833516,0.013143483023001095,0.038335158817086525,0.001095290251916758,0.02190580503833516,0.01095290251916758,0.01533406352683461,0.014238773274917854,0.0032858707557502738,0.00547645125958379,0.017524644030668127,0.0032858707557502738,0.017524644030668127,0,0.001095290251916758,0.019715224534501644,0.22234392113910187,0.012048192771084338,0,0.0208105147864184,0.05147864184008762,0.06681270536692223,0.0416210295728368,0.017524644030668127,0.03066812705366922,0.14676889375684557,0.07995618838992333,0.03723986856516977,0,0.023001095290251915,0.12814895947426067,0.002190580503833516,0.0208105147864184,0.0032858707557502738,0.001095290251916758,0.002190580503833516,0,0.002190580503833516,0.0208105147864184,0.08981380065717415,0.07119386637458927,0,0.03614457831325301,0.00547645125958379,0.03943044906900329,0.1171960569550931,0.12048192771084337,0.002190580503833516,0.03723986856516977,0,26.775,1,99.875,0,11,0,20,14,6.3,65.375,18.8,1.375,35.675,6,26.775,0,86.62499999999999,22,150.375,252.70000000000002,86.62499999999999,,0.48321042623632504,0.03374315277967364,0.7771729900909424,0,0.27752798768537873,0,0.41122105364536693,0.3283637656598363,0.18033159308131647,0.6953999943112318,0.39632645743139333,0.04581708029444104,0.5547293390384362,0.17323195505014824,0.45596479933305306,0,0.07848600163087795,0.019932952795143608,0.13624626257135092,0.22895714415149046,-0.7589425149073307,0.7710428558485095,62

14,"Evan McMullin, a former C. I. A. official and a Republican who passionately opposes Donald J. Trump, announced Monday that he would run for president as an independent candidate. Mr. McMullin, who until recently worked on policy development with the House Republican Conference, has missed the   deadlines in more than two dozen states. But Mr. McMullin, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, studied in Utah and could take votes from Mr. Trump in the heavily Mormon state. In an interview, Mr. McMullin said he was strongly opposed to both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. But his harshest words, and his clearest motivation, appeared to come from Mr. Trump’s candidacy. “Really what’s impacted me is the way Trump’s treated our veterans, our heroes,” he said. “The things he said about John McCain, the things he said about the Khan family, and Mrs. Khan. ” Mr. Trump last year disparaged Mr. McCain’s status as a war hero because the Republican senator from Arizona was captured, and more recently he insinuated that Ghazala Khan  —   the mother of a fallen Muslim soldier who appeared with her husband, Khizr, at the Democratic convention  —   did not speak because she was not permitted to by her religion. Mr. McMullin is said to be backed by the group Better for America, which earlier this year began an effort to get on the ballot in as many states as possible, with the hopes of drafting a candidate. The group is backed by John Kingston, a donor who had supported Mitt Romney. Mr. Kingston has worked with the pollster Joel Searby. Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant and Trump foe, is the main strategist on the effort. Polling shows that Mr. Trump’s support in Utah is very low for a Republican presidential candidate, and it has particularly suffered amid his battles against Mr. Romney, a Mormon who was the Republican nominee in 2012. If Mr. McMullin is competitive nowhere else but Utah, he still could nonetheless have an effect on the race: Mr. Trump cannot win the presidency without holding the states that Mr. Romney won, his aides have concluded. That Mr. McMullin has a national security background makes him a more appealing option, potentially, to conservatives who cannot bring themselves to support Mr. Trump, but who strongly dislike Mrs. Clinton. Not everyone sounded pleased with Mr. McMullin’s entry into politics. A spokesman for the House Republican Conference, Nate Hodson, said, “The House Republican Conference has zero knowledge of his intentions. ”",,422,19.181818181818183,22,0.35545023696682465,0,0,0,0,92.09574031868938,1.4754321159743518,84.03001579778831,57.1301494713817,0.7559241706161137,0.026066350710900472,0.035545023696682464,0.016587677725118485,0.04976303317535545,0.018957345971563982,0.20853080568720378,0.0071090047393364926,0,0.014218009478672985,0.1018957345971564,0,0.061611374407582936,0.002369668246445498,0,0.018957345971563982,0.0071090047393364926,0.08767772511848342,0.002369668246445498,0.07582938388625593,0.030805687203791468,0.04739336492890995,0,0.002369668246445498,0.035545023696682464,0.011848341232227487,0.14218009478672985,0,0.0071090047393364926,0,0.014218009478672985,0,0.002369668246445498,0.061611374407582936,0,0,0.43601895734597157,0,0.02132701421800948,0.009478672985781991,0.004739336492890996,0.045023696682464455,0,0,0.009478672985781991,0.02132701421800948,0.002369668246445498,0.07582938388625593,0,0.009478672985781991,0.016587677725118485,0.016587677725118485,0,0,0.009478672985781991,0.1990521327014218,0.004739336492890996,0,0.02843601895734597,0.0971563981042654,0.07582938388625593,0.04976303317535545,0.03317535545023697,0.0947867298578199,0.12322274881516587,0.0947867298578199,0.016587677725118485,0,0.014218009478672985,0.07819905213270142,0.018957345971563982,0.011848341232227487,0.002369668246445498,0.0071090047393364926,0.0071090047393364926,0,0.002369668246445498,0.037914691943127965,0.15165876777251186,0.04265402843601896,0,0.016587677725118485,0.002369668246445498,0.026066350710900472,0.13033175355450238,0.12559241706161137,0.004739336492890996,0.045023696682464455,0,18,0,19,0,4,0,5,13.625,9,8,4,2,23,0,18,0,49,8,64.25,116.25,49,,0.4618205632866772,0,0.47528306714756435,0,0.16015261286229274,0,0.19248405980003652,0.3937727324827964,0.3002384196953406,0.2760888715617666,0.16015261286229274,0.08704668331836253,0.5230104476598908,0,0.5905183988571152,0,0.09640924741760945,0.01574028529267093,0.1264141662567634,0.22872602065912445,-0.5069409865538134,0.7712739793408756,30
15,"Kevin Shenkman could be described as one of the most prolific and successful civil rights lawyers of his generation, after almost   pushing dozens of Southern California communities to change their election systems under the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA) over the past few years. [To many in those communities, however, Shenkman is a villain, a   from Malibu who is creating racial divisions where they do not exist  —   and making millions in the process.  He is, according to local podcaster Stephen Daniels, “the most hated man in Santa Clarita. ” And he is “hated” there  —   and elsewhere  —   because he wins. Shenkman scored his latest victory last Wednesday evening, when the Oceanside City Council voted   to approve a proposal to move from an   system, where every council member is elected by the voters as a whole, to a district system, where voters are only represented directly by one member, from a particular geographic area. The change was prompted by a March 22 letter from Shenkman, claiming that the city’s   system prevented minority groups from winning elections, and warning of a lawsuit to follow. Residents of Oceanside were shocked, and angry, at the charge. The city has had several Latino council members, including one who has served on the council for the last 16 years. It also recently had an   mayor. Shenkman claimed in his letter to the city that Oceanside’s 65. 2% white majority engaged in “bloc voting” to exclude Latinos, and cited Linda Gonzales, who lost a city council race last year. Gonzales opposed Shenkman’s effort, and told Breitbart News that she believes lost her election fairly. She added that Shenkman never asked her permission to use her name. Nevertheless, the council members capitulated to Shenkman’s threat, after the city attorney advised them last Wednesday that no city or school board had ever successfully defended an   election system from a CVRA challenge in court. Score another win for Shenkman. His law firm, Shenkman  Hughes, boasts on its website that he “has never lost a case, and has no intention of breaking that winning streak. ” Curiously, in his extensive bio on the website, which touts his work in “all aspects of intellectual property law, including litigation of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret matters,” as well as other areas of civil litigation, he omits any mention of his voting rights cases (as of this writing). Shenkman’s path to law, and voting rights, are rather unconventional. Today, he lives in Malibu, one of the wealthiest communities in the state, whose population is over 90% white. But as he told the Talk of Santa Clarita podcast in January, he grew up in the Detroit area. There, he said, he was a “bad kid,” committing “the occasional little criminal misdemeanor kinda thing, maybe the occasional felony that I never got caught for. ” He had “some interaction with the justice system,” and formed a bond with his attorney, who inspired him to pursue a legal career. Shenkman graduated from Rice University with a B. S. in mechanical engineering (which he describes as “completely useless”) and went to Columbia Law School. He is married, with four daughters. He told Talk of Santa Clarita that if he were still practicing patent law, “I would have shot myself by now,” calling it “  boring. ” Shenkman’s Facebook profile photo is an image of a giant metal fist: the Joe Louis monument in Detroit, Michigan. (His cover photo is the same image: “Fuck your FB rules,” he explains in a comment to a relative.) His timeline features a photograph of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was killed while fighting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012, who was later acquitted. He is a Democrat, and gave $1375 to the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee in 2014, according to the Federal Elections Commission. He has also contributed to Democrats at the state and local levels, according to the California Secretary of State. The public record also suggests that Shenkman has had a colorful career as a plaintiff’s attorney, filing class action suits on behalf of consumers  —   and sometimes acting as the plaintiff himself. Currently, Shenkman and his law partner are plaintiffs in a class action suit filed last year against AutoZone, claiming that the auto parts dealer had not informed them that it was changing its rewards program so that a $20 credit on purchases over $20 would expire after one year. In 2014, he represented consumers in successful class action claims against restaurant chains that falsely advertised Kobe beef during a period when Japanese beef imports were banned. In 2011, Shenkman personally filed a consumer class action suit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, claiming that employees had misled him into believing the restaurant’s pinto beans were vegetarian, when they are actually made with bacon. In his lawsuit, he cited his vegetarianism and Jewish faith (though Jewish dietary laws, which require that food be certified kosher by a rabbi, would not have permitted him to eat at Chipotle at all). That case was dismissed in 2015, more than four years later, according to court documents. He also reportedly sued the Chinese   chain Panda Express, claiming it failed to disclose that it adds chicken powder to its vegetarian entrees. That same year, he was the plaintiff  —   identified as an “avid runner” in media reports  —   in class action suits filed against coconut water companies Vita Coco and One World Enterprises, claiming they had exaggerated the hydration benefits of their products. Both cases were dismissed court documents indicate that he accepted a token settlement of $2, 000 in the Vida Coco case as part of a related nationwide class action settlement. Following those adventures in consumer litigation, Shenkman found a new issue to litigate: minority voting rights. Specifically, Shenkman turned his attention to the CVRA, a law signed in 2002 by Democratic Governor Gray Davis  —   who was later recalled by the California electorate  —   that made it easy for activists to sue towns, school boards, and other local government bodies with   voting. In addition, the CVRA allows plaintiffs to “prove” that “racially polarized voting occurs” simply by showing that a member of a minority group might have won an election if not for being outvoted by members of the majority (usually white). The CVRA is a   law with a contentious history. Over a decade ago, in the Sanchez v. City of Modesto case, a state court found the CVRA unconstitutional. But that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2006, and the U. S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case, keeping the law intact. Among other questionable provisions, the CVRA includes incentives for lawyers to sue by allowing successful plaintiff’s attorneys to recover their fees from the defendants, while preventing successful defendants from doing the same. For activist groups and ambitious lawyers, the CVRA is a   scheme but for local governments, it is a   scenario. They must pay their own legal fees, win or lose, and if they lose they must also pay the legal costs  —   often exorbitant  —   of the other side. For the first several years that the CVRA was in force, just two attorneys made “all of the roughly $4. 3 million” that resulted from settlements under the law, according to the Associated Press. Those two attorneys just happened to be the two lawyers who drafted the law, including San   civil rights lawyer Robert Rubin. At some point, Shenkman apparently recognized the political and financial opportunity that the CVRA presented in Southern California. “Like everything else, it just fell on me,” he told Talk of Santa Clarita, recalling an early conversation with Antelope Valley Democratic Party activist Darren Parker. In 2012, Shenkman began suing cities and school districts throughout the region  —   most notably the city of Palmdale, which was likely seen as an easy target because   of its population are minorities, while its city council is largely white. Palmdale fought back, and the subsequent court fight set the template for other confrontations between Shenkman and his targets. At first, the city was defiant, fighting Shenkman in court and holding elections that a judge later declared were illegal. In the end, however, after being worn down by years of litigation and appeals, Palmdale agreed to a settlement that required it to pay $4. 5 million. (Curiously, one of the plaintiffs’ other lawyers was R. Rex Parris, the mayor of the neighboring city of Lancaster, which still uses the   election system.) Since the Palmdale case, Shenkman told Voice of OC last year, he has been inundated with calls from potential plaintiffs. Some of Shenkman’s potential plaintiffs are local politicians. He told Voice of OC that he also works with the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, a   Latino organization (with a Los Angeles office) which he reportedly represented in at least one case. Shenkman uses the Palmdale case to push other cities into immediate compliance. In his letter to Oceanside, for example, he wrote: “As you may be aware, in 2012, we sued the City of Palmdale for violating the CVRA. After an   trial, we prevailed. After spending millions of dollars, a   remedy was ultimately imposed on the Palmdale city council, with districts that combine all incumbents into one of the four districts. ” Shenkman and his supporters argue that districts increase the chance that minority candidates will win elections, presuming people vote as racial blocs. Shenkman told Talk of Santa Clarita that the   system had been created in the early 20th century to “freeze out” minorities.   elections, according to Shenkman and to the few advocates who spoke in favor of districts at the Oceanside city council meeting, are also theoretically less expensive, lowering the barrier to entry for candidates. And with fewer constituents per public official, districts might allow more direct interaction between local voters and their elected representatives. (In Santa Clarita, Shenkman pushed for cumulative voting, in which voters can vote more than once for their preferred candidates, telling Talk of Santa Clarita that the system would be more likely than districts to elect Latinos to the city council.) Many residents, however, seem to prefer the   system. One reason, frequently cited by the opponents of Oceanside’s proposed district system, is that every single member of a local government body under an   system is accountable to each voter. Some, like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, also argue that small communities share too much in common to be divided politically in ways that encourage politicians to favor their local neighborhoods over others. And many communities reject the idea that they are racist  —   or that they use “bloc voting” to exclude minorities, as Shenkman alleges. They also dislike the drawing of districts using racial criteria, arguing it creates new divisions in the community  —   a frequent refrain among the opponents in Oceanside. More than the particular form of government, what many communities resent is the way they are being compelled to accept districts  —   through legal threats and accusations of racism. Oceanside Councilmember Jack Feller, who voted against the new system, told the Los Angeles Times that he felt “disgusted   …     that this is being forced on us. ” If Palmdale was an attractive target, Oceanside was a poor one. Just over a third of its residents are Latino, and there has been at least one Hispanic representative on the   city council for the last two decades. At the council meeting on Wednesday evening, many of the most vociferous opponents of the new plan were Hispanic. But the Palmdale case loomed large in the minds of the council members, who voted  —   narrowly  —   to surrender. Gonzales, the candidate whose name Shenkman used in his letter to the city, told Breitbart News that she felt he had exploited her for his own purposes. She said that she had reached Shenkman by telephone, and found him rude, until she explained who she was. At that point, she said, he expressed sympathy for her recent election loss. She told him she had lost because she was running against veteran incumbents, not because of racism. “I told [Shenkman] that I agree we need to get more Latinos involved in the government, and in our democracy, and in our Constitution,” but without special districts, Gonzales recalled. “He didn’t want to talk to me after that. ” And she added: “They’re working against the people they’re trying to help. ” That is a common sentiment in the communities Shenkman has confronted. In Palmdale, when Shenkman sued to stop city council elections in 2013, the city accused him of “attempting to stop an election where at least one minority candidate is essentially guaranteed to win a seat on the City Council,” given the field of candidates. The city attorney opined that Shenkman’s legal team was “only interested in gouging the taxpayers to line their pockets. ” Shenkman later defended his payout to the Los Angeles Times: “We did very well on the Palmdale case. But people who criticized us don’t realize the enormous risk that we took. ” (It is not clear what “risk” Shenkman was referring to, since  —   as noted above  —   the CRVA does not allow successful defendants to recover costs. He told Voice of OC: “I was not paying my mortgage in order to pay the experts. And the court reporters’ fees, and other stuff. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in    costs. ” Other lawyers, he said, might not have been “crazy enough” to try.) Shenkman also told Talk of Santa Clarita that he “embraced” the financial rewards of his voting rights cases, admitting that he posted a photograph of the check he received from Palmdale on his Facebook page with the caption: “Picture me rollin’ bitches. ” He has, at times, described his highly lucrative voting rights campaign in more idealistic,   even   terms. In a speech in 2013, he said: “Other people have introduced me as just being the bad guy. They call [me] the   the ambulance chaser, some other names that are probably not even as nice as that. And all for seeking to allow racial and ethnic minorities   …     to have a say in their city governments, their school boards. ” He later admitted, however, to “extorting” local governments, in an interview with Voice of OC: “That’s all true   …     taking advantage of easy targets  —   yeah. There are a lot of easy targets, but they should change. If they change their election system, I wouldn’t need or have the opportunity to sue them. ” Since the Palmdale case, Shenkman has overturned   election systems throughout Southern California, most of which had been in place for many decades, without complaint. The Orange County Register called the changes a “historic upheaval,” citing “dozens” of local agencies that had been forced to change from   to district voting. Not even liberal cities are safe. Last year Shenkman sued the City of Santa Monica, which prides itself on its   “progressive” politics, and which has a Latino mayor. Shenkman’s client in Santa Monica is Maria Loya, who has run unsuccessfully for local office. She is married to Oscar de la Torre, who claims he lost a race for city council in November 2016 because of the   system. (De la Torre came sixth in a race where the top four won seats Mayor Tony Vazquez won the   number of votes.) He is on the board of the Pico Neighborhood Association, which is also a plaintiff in the case. (In addition to Shenkman, one of the other lawyers for the plaintiffs is none other than CVRA   Robert Rubin himself another is Mayor Parris of Lancaster, once again.) Shenkman told Talk of Santa Clarita that the Democrats on the Santa Monica city council are “hypocritical. ” He added: “[T]hey’re saying the same   things” as the city of Palmdale . Last year, however, Shenkman’s lawsuit nearly derailed negotiations between Santa Monica and his home town of Malibu over the creation of a separate Malibu school district, something local activists in Malibu fervently desire. Initially, Shenkman was on Malibu’s negotiating team. But when Shenkman filed his lawsuit, without warning, Santa Monica cut off talks. “[T]his legal action could jeopardize our ability to move forward in a productive manner,” the school board president said in a press release, reported at the time by the Santa Monica Daily Press. A group called Advocates for Malibu Public Schools, which had initially joined Shenkman’s lawsuit as plaintiffs, withdrew from the case, and Shenkman resigned as a member of the negotiating team, saying his involvement had become a “distraction. ” Given Shenkman’s unsparing style, perhaps Santa Monica should not have been surprised. When voters in the San Fernando Valley town of Glendale rejected a district system by a    margin in a 2015 referendum, Shenkman sued the school district. When the San Bernardino County town of Upland agreed to a settlement with Shenkman, which involved hiring demographers to draw districts that favored Latinos, they still had to pay legal fees. And when the Orange County city of Fullerton created districts, Shenkman went back to court to challenge the new boundaries. Shenkman has a brash style of speaking, and is not shy to express contempt for his legal and political opponents. On Talk of Santa Clarita, Shenkman referred disparagingly to local Latino politicians with whom he disagreed  —   in explicitly racial terms: “I don’t think very highly of the crowd in Santa Clarita who are Latino by name only,” he said, singling out   Republican Assemblyman Dante Acosta ( ) as “one that comes to mind. ” Shenkman also made an astonishing allegation about a former State Senate candidate, Democrat Johnathon Ervin: Shenkman: And the Democrats that were up [for election] were horrible candidates. Daniels: Mmm. Shenkman: I mean, Johnathon Ervin is a horrible candidate. Daniels: Why do you say that? Shenkman: He’s got so many problems, man. First of all, the guy takes bribes, OK? Daniels: Ugh. Shenkman: You know  —   Daniels: Hey man, you’re a lawyer. I mean, don’t you at least want to say, “allegedly”? Shenkman: No. He added, later in the interview, that he had received death threats, and threats to his family, as a result of his work on voting rights. But he was undeterred, and said he has many requests from local activists to confront their cities. In discussing the cities he has taken on, Shenkman seems to adopt an imperious tone, confident that he can shape outcomes to his will. When asked by Daniels about whether Santa Clarita could avoid a lawsuit by appointing a Latino member to the council, he said that it would depend on whom they appointed: I think it very much depends on who they appoint. And right now, as the council stands, there are four white, conservative Republicans of a similar mind. And that is not what the City of Santa Clarita is. I would love to see the city council have the kind of maturity to appoint someone who does not share all of their views  …     Maybe the fifth person should bring some diversity of ideas. Shenkman also vowed on Talk of Santa Clarita to depose the current Santa Clarita city council  —   which he claimed was elected unlawfully  —   eventually: “Any time a city fights us to the bitter end, that’s the approach that we take. ” Ironically, Shenkman’s own town of Malibu has an   election system  —   the very system Shenkman is destroying elsewhere  —   and an apparently   city council. But not enough minorities live there: only 6. 1% of the population is Hispanic, and only 1. 2% is black. Ironically, that means the CVRA might not apply to Malibu. But perhaps the greatest irony is that for all of Shenkman’s legal work over the past five years, the new district systems are little better at electing minorities to office than the old   systems. Last month, the Times observed: “A voting law meant to increase minority representation has generated many more lawsuits than seats for people of color. ” It added: “Of the 22 cities that have made the move to district elections since June [2016] only seven saw an overall gain in Latino council members. ” And the reasons for poor Latino representation had nothing to do with racism, the Times reported: A number of factors likely contributed to the low numbers, including historically low turnout by Latino voters and a lack of candidates with the means to run, experts said. Also, even in cities with large Latino populations, some residents can’t vote because they are too young, are here illegally or are not citizens. The threat of legal action has forced cities to switch to council districts, but in some cases the move hasn’t resulted in more minority representation because the city already is   and drawing districts where minorities predominate is difficult. Shenkman told the Times that he had filed about ten lawsuits  —   and that, in the newspaper’s words, he “couldn’t remember how many warning letters he has sent to local governments. ” That campaign has upended local government in Southern California, and divided communities by race in ways that may linger for generations, but it has achieved almost nothing else  —   except making Kevin Shenkman richer. There are only two ways to stop Shenkman. One is to meet his challenge in court. Since 2013, the legal landscape has changed: the Supreme Court tossed part of the federal Voting Rights Act in 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder. In doing so, the Court emphasized the importance of evidence in determining whether there is racial discrimination in any particular jurisdiction. The Court could, theoretically, toss out the California Voting Rights Act for vagueness, since its evidentiary standards are so low that it allows virtually any candidate to challenge an election loss as racist. Given the wide impact of the CVRA across the state over the last few years, the Court might have also a greater interest in hearing a challenge than it did a decade ago. The confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch might also offer hope to defendants. But realistically, few local communities have the money to gamble on a Supreme Court win. That leaves one last recourse: the state legislature. The communities of Southern California could approach their elected representatives, Democrat and Republican, and ask them to amend the CVRA to require higher standards of proof of racism, or at least to remove the monetary incentives that reward lawyers like Shenkman for their exploits. On most issues, Democrats in Sacramento might not be inclined to listen to conservative cities in the Inland Empire or San Diego County. But Shenkman is pursuing liberal Santa Monica, too. There could be bipartisan interest in protecting local government from outside lawyers who can squeeze taxpayers with arguably frivolous lawsuits. Until then, Shenkman will keep going. As he said in 2013: “The law is the law. ” Shenkman did not reply to requests for comment. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

18,".@brianstelter: Good journalism led to the revelations about Flynn that resulted in his resignation https:  .  On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day,” CNN Senior Media Correspondent and “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter said the controversy that led to the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was “a big moment for investigative journalism. ”  Stelter said, “These journalists who did not ask about Flynn, they looked bad yesterday afternoon, they look even worse now, now that Flynn has resigned. ” He added, “And, by the way, a big moment for investigative journalism. This has been a story led by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the CNNs of the world. If it weren’t for journalists digging, digging, digging into this, we wouldn’t know about it. So, when you hear about anonymous sources, when you hear about leaks from the White House, or from the government, this is why that’s so important for us. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",,165,23.571428571428573,7,0.2545454545454545,0,0,0,0,77.65144956054047,31.93939393939395,81.84029484029485,10.471625344352617,0.7818181818181819,0,0.04242424242424243,0.07878787878787878,0.048484848484848485,0.01818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0,0,0.030303030303030304,0.07878787878787878,0,0.05454545454545454,0,0,0.04242424242424243,0,0.08484848484848485,0.012121212121212121,0.10303030303030303,0.006060606060606061,0.048484848484848485,0,0,0.024242424242424242,0.012121212121212121,0.07878787878787878,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07272727272727272,0,0,0.45454545454545453,0,0.024242424242424242,0.006060606060606061,0,0.06666666666666667,0.006060606060606061,0,0.012121212121212121,0.024242424242424242,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0.024242424242424242,0.01818181818181818,0.030303030303030304,0.006060606060606061,0,0,0.18181818181818182,0.012121212121212121,0.006060606060606061,0.048484848484848485,0.048484848484848485,0.048484848484848485,0.048484848484848485,0.01818181818181818,0.030303030303030304,0.13333333333333333,0.11515151515151516,0.006060606060606061,0,0.06060606060606061,0.1696969696969697,0,0.012121212121212121,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.024242424242424242,0,0,0.012121212121212121,0.10909090909090909,0.05454545454545454,0,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0.08484848484848485,0.15151515151515152,0.10909090909090909,0.012121212121212121,0.030303030303030304,0.012121212121212121,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,7,6,3,1,0,3,0,11,0,26,37,11,,0.2022631961725015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5035213014023038,0,0.3717045820153256,0.3364707442038019,0.2022631961725015,0.0779292055122247,0,0.5590306647883708,0,0.0582010582010582,0,0.13756613756613756,0.19576719576719576,-0.6419419098057333,0.8042328042328042,13
19,"Obama Attacks FBI Chief for Investigating Hillary November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Richard Nixon called. He wants his old job back. There hasn't been a president and a party who were this blatantly corrupt ever. There's no question that Obama has made history. It's just the wrong kind of history. Initially the White House chose not to join Hillary's war on the FBI. Then Obama threw all caution to the winds and decided to echo the spin chamber's lines about ""innuendo"" and ""incomplete information"". Never mind that it was Obama's own DOJ which was blocking FBI efforts to secure the emails and resolve the issue. It's a sad day in America when the White House actively seeks to obstruct and intimidate an FBI investigation and when the media cheers on this brand of corrupt thuggery.",,142,15.777777777777779,9,0.24647887323943662,0,0,0,0,72.26653252850436,12.45750694644055,52.816901408450704,25.774193548387096,0.7464788732394366,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.06338028169014084,0.07042253521126761,0.014084507042253521,0.14788732394366197,0.02112676056338028,0,0.04929577464788732,0.09154929577464789,0,0.06338028169014084,0,0,0.007042253521126761,0.028169014084507043,0.09859154929577464,0,0.007042253521126761,0,0.06338028169014084,0,0.007042253521126761,0.014084507042253521,0.007042253521126761,0.07746478873239436,0,0,0,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0.056338028169014086,0,0,0.4084507042253521,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0,0.06338028169014084,0,0,0.028169014084507043,0.028169014084507043,0.007042253521126761,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.035211267605633804,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0.19014084507042253,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0.06338028169014084,0.06338028169014084,0.014084507042253521,0.035211267605633804,0.028169014084507043,0.07746478873239436,0.07746478873239436,0.007042253521126761,0,0.028169014084507043,0.11971830985915492,0,0,0.02112676056338028,0.007042253521126761,0.014084507042253521,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0.04929577464788732,0.028169014084507043,0,0.02112676056338028,0,0.08450704225352113,0.11971830985915492,0.11267605633802817,0,0.035211267605633804,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,4,13,0,3,1,9,0,0,0,0,10,4,43,57,10,,0,0,0.6101740798276877,0,0,0,0.22966848451216434,0.49211838590759965,0,0.1827439976315568,0.06936540706703205,0.40149162409079436,0,0,0.40149162409079436,0,0.055248618784530384,0.022099447513812154,0.23756906077348067,0.3149171270718232,-0.7767112228661965,0.6850828729281768,18

He has worked as a community organizer and activist. “Honor Our Immigrant Veterans” Replayed By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 8, 2016 Veterans By elizawhig “Honor Our Immigrant Veterans” from VoteVets is a video on Youtube I tripped over recently, and have watched several times. It is that good. Another Kossack may have already posted it, but I would like to get it some play. Not because I think it will change any voter’s mind, but because it deserves to be seen to remind us of who we are as Americans. We are all immigrants or the children of immigrants, and we and our relatives and grandparents have had to make tough choices that deserve to be remembered. I had an uncle (by marriage) who was Italian. In 1940 he was still not a US citizen, although I gather he had begun the process, so he was sent to an internment camp in Wyoming (or Montana?). While he waited for his citizenship application to be completed, he and his fellow detainees played a lot of poker. His papers were finally processed, he was made a US Citizen, then was promptly drafted into the US Army as a Sargent (Supply). And of course he was sent to…Italy. His division survived Anzio, then my uncle came into his glory. His father was someone of importance further north, so he had connections. He was able to secure excellent billets (in a castle) and good food and drink for his comrades.

22,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   The U. S. needs to consider military action to disrupt Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, which have intensified since the Islamic Republic signed a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, a top American commander warned American lawmakers. [Former President Barack Obama and other supporters of the nuclear deal argued that it would promote peace and avoid military confrontation.  Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) testified Wednesday before the House Armed Services Committee about the security challenges facing his area of responsibility (AOR).  The Central Region, or CENTCOM AOR, spans more than 4 million square miles that cover 20 predominantly Muslim nations that stretch from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. In his written testimony, Gen. Votel declared: Iran poses the most significant threat to the Central Region and to our national interests and the interests of our partners and allies. We have not seen any improvement in Iran’s behavior since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) addressing Iran’s nuclear program, was finalized in July 2015. Over the past year, after the nuclear deal was signed, the U. S. military has been dealing with Iran and its proxies carrying out “a range of malign activities” in the Central Region, namely in “Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Egypt, the Sinai, and the    Strait [located between Yemen and Djibouti and Eritrea] and in other parts of our area of responsibility,” declared Gen. Votel. Democrat Congresswoman Jacky Rosen from Nevada asked the top U. S. general during the hearing, “Do you believe Iran has increased destabilizing activity since the JCPOA?” “I do believe they have,” responded Gen. Votel, adding in his written remarks: Unfortunately, the [nuclear] agreement has led some to believe that we have largely addressed the Iranian problem set and that is not the case. In addition to its nuclear weapons potential, Iran presents several credible threats. They have a robust theater ballistic missile program, and we remain concerned about their cyber and maritime activities, as well as the activities of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  —   Qods Forces ( ) and their network of affiliates, [including their   proxy Hezbollah]. Since the nuclear agreement was signed, Iran has been “clearly focused” on expanding its influence and power in the Central Region, noted Votel. “Recognizing that Iran poses the greatest   threat to U. S. interests in the Central Region, we must seize opportunities to both reassure our allies and shape Iran’s behavior,” he pointed out, adding, “Through both messaging and actions, we must also be clear in our communications and ensure the credibility of U. S. intentions. ” To disrupt Iran’s growing threat, the U. S. must consider military action and other ways, proclaimed Gen. Votel. “I’ve had an opportunity to talk with some of our regional partners about it,” he said. “I think we need to look at opportunities where we can disrupt through military means or other means, their activities. ” “In addition to ready military actions, we must support the broader USG [U. S. Government] strategy with regard to Iran which should include new diplomatic initiatives that provide Iran with viable alternatives to its present course,” he conceded. The U. S. general did stress that Iran must be aware that there will be consequences if it continues its malign and provocative activities. “The point that I would emphasize to you is that while there may be other more strategic or consequential threats or regions in our world, today, the central region has come to represent the nexus for many of the security challenges our nation faces,” warned the CENTCOM commander. “Most importantly, the threats in this region continue to pose the most direct threat to the U. S. homeland and the global economy. Thus it must remain a priority and be resourced accordingly,” added Gen. Votel. The   region is home to the largest concentration of U. S. and United   terrorist groups  —   13 in Afghanistan and seven in Pakistan, according to the U. S. military. Moreover, “the Middle East remains the global epicenter of terrorism and violent Islamist extremism,” wrote Gen. Votel. Citing the Institute for Economics and Peace’s 2016 Global Terrorism Index, he testified that “the U. S.

23,"Friday on Fox News Channel’s, “The O’Reilly Factor,”    Donald Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway reacted to Vice President Joe Biden telling Trump to “grow up. Time to be an adult. You’re president. ”  According to Conway, it was Trump’s policies that made it possible for Trump to be president. Conway said, “It’s really disappointing to hear the vice president speak that way, not surprising. To what is he referring, the fact that his Democratic party under his watch, he’s been the number two guy in the country and in the Democratic Party, they lost over 1, 000 state legislative seats, they lost over a dozen governorships, a dozen senators, they lost 68 House seats since he got there.  They lost the election in 2010, 2014, 2016. In large part because of the policies he supports like the awful unaffordable, inaccessible care act, Obamacare. ” “Like these draconian taxes and regulations on small businesses and the rest of us, like all these bad trade deals that never benefited American workers,” she continued. “And Donald Trump who came in  —   without Joe Biden and Barack Obama, there may have never been a president Trump and a Vice President Mike Pence. So I’d like to say to the vice president, thanks for the  . We’ll ignore the insults and the slights. We very much appreciate all the failed policies that allowed us to usher in a new era of hopefulness and buoyancy, fresh blood and excitement in this administration. You’re now going to see president Donald Trump, very quickly, deliver and perform and be accountable to results like as he has always done in his wildly successful business. It’s gong to be a brand new, not just the tone but the content, in Washington. ”",,297,19.8,15,0.25252525252525254,0,0,0,0,85.62563951200315,5.588539718169347,80.92835765057987,20.65693976805088,0.8013468013468014,0.02356902356902357,0.026936026936026935,0.03367003367003367,0.06397306397306397,0.020202020202020204,0.20875420875420875,0.003367003367003367,0,0.037037037037037035,0.08080808080808081,0,0.06397306397306397,0.003367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0.02356902356902357,0.020202020202020204,0.07407407407407407,0,0.08417508417508418,0.020202020202020204,0.050505050505050504,0,0,0.016835016835016835,0,0.12794612794612795,0,0,0,0.003367003367003367,0,0.010101010101010102,0.04040404040404041,0.003367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0.45791245791245794,0,0.013468013468013467,0.003367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0.04713804713804714,0.003367003367003367,0,0.006734006734006734,0.006734006734006734,0.010101010101010102,0.030303030303030304,0.020202020202020204,0.016835016835016835,0.016835016835016835,0.03367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0,0.030303030303030304,0.21885521885521886,0.003367003367003367,0,0.020202020202020204,0.050505050505050504,0.09764309764309764,0.06734006734006734,0.030303030303030304,0.08080808080808081,0.13804713804713806,0.11447811447811448,0.013468013468013467,0,0.03367003367003367,0.11784511784511785,0,0.010101010101010102,0.006734006734006734,0.020202020202020204,0.006734006734006734,0,0,0.030303030303030304,0.10437710437710437,0.06397306397306397,0,0.006734006734006734,0.013468013468013467,0.04040404040404041,0.12794612794612795,0.12457912457912458,0.013468013468013467,0.07744107744107744,0.006734006734006734,4,0,13,6.875,0,0,5,19.125,13,0,1,2,22.21875,0,4,0,42.21875,5,51.125,97.34375,42.21875,,0.1876127897984334,0,0.4287527098011759,0.2841436508997255,0,0,0.22400923773979586,0.5247560264568643,0.4287527098011759,0,0.054583639049126324,0.10351694645735657,0.5619415002038565,0,0.6102978945320481,0,0.11369182866279559,0.013464613313136413,0.13767567112681983,0.26213919044012457,-0.4210256617742718,0.7378608095598754,23
24,"What to Do About ‘Fake News’ November 18, 2016 Exclusive: A pushback is coming to the Internet’s success in giving the world access to diverse opinions and dissenting information. Politicians, mainstream media and technology giants are taking aim at what they call “fake news,” reports Robert Parry. By Robert Parry In the wake of Donald Trump’s victory, a hot new issue – raised by President Obama in an international setting on Thursday and touted on The New York Times’ front page on Friday – is the problem of “fake news” being disseminated on the Internet. Major Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, are being urged to censor such articles and to punish alleged violators. Also, teams of supposedly “responsible” news providers and technology giants are being assembled to police this alleged problem and decide what is true and what is not. President Obama in the Oval Office. But therein lies the more serious problem: who gets to decide what is real and what is not real? And – in an age when all sides propagate propaganda – when does conformity in support of a mainstream “truth” become censorship of reasonable skepticism? As a journalist for more than four decades, I take seriously the profession’s responsibility to verify information as much as possible before publishing it – and as editor of Consortiumnews.com, I insist that our writers (and to the extent possible, outside commenters) back up what they say. I personally hate “conspiracy theories” in which people speculate about a topic without real evidence and often in defiance of actual evidence. I believe in traditional journalistic standards of cross-checking data and applying common sense. So, I am surely no fan of Internet hoaxes and baseless accusations. Yet, I also recognize that mainstream U.S. news outlets have made horrendous and wholesale factual errors, too, such as reporting in 2002-03 that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program (The New York Times) and was hiding stockpiles of WMD (many TV and print outlets, including The Washington Post). And, mainstream outlets getting such life-and-death stories wrong was not just a one-off affair around the Iraq invasion. At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light. For instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal , but actively covered up the Reagan administration’s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s. The Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times’ gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration. [For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ New York Times: Apologist for Power .”] In that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan’s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons. More recently, during the mad dash to invade Iraq in 2002-03, the Post’s editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt wrote repeatedly as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and mocked the few dissenting voices that challenged the “group think.” Yet, Hiatt suffered no accountability for his falsehoods and is still the Post’s editorial-page editor, still peddling dubious examples of Washington’s conventional wisdom . Ministry of Truth So, who are the “responsible” journalists who should be anointed to regulate what the world’s public gets to see and hear? For that Orwellian task, a kind of Ministry of Truth has been set up by Google, called the First Draft Coalition , which touts itself as a collection of 30 major news and technology companies , including the Times and Post, tackling “fake news” and creating a platform to decide which stories are questionable and which ones aren’t. Correspondent Michael Usher of Australia’s “60 Minutes” claims to have found the billboard visible in a video of a BUK missile launcher after the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014, but the scenes actually don’t match up at all. (Screen shot from Australia’s “60 Minutes”) Formed in June 2015 and funded by Google News Lab, the First Draft Coalition’s founding members included Bellingcat, an online “citizen journalism” site that has gotten many of its highest profile stories wrong and is now associated with NATO’s favorite think tank, the Atlantic Council. Despite Bellingcat’s checkered record and its conflicts of interest through the Atlantic Council, major Western news outlets, including the Times and Post, have embraced Bellingcat, apparently because its articles always seem to mesh neatly with U.S. and European propaganda on Syria and Ukraine. Two of Bellingcat’s (or its founder Eliot Higgins’s) biggest errors were misplacing the firing location of the suspected Syrian rocket carrying sarin gas on Aug. 21, 2013, and directing an Australian news crew to the wrong site for the so-called getaway Buk video after the July 17, 2014 shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. A screen shot of the roadway where the suspected BUK missile battery supposedly passed after the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014. (Image from Australian “60 Minutes” program) But like many news outlets that support establishment “group thinks,” Bellingcat wins widespread praise and official endorsements, such as from the international MH-17 investigation that was largely controlled by Ukraine’s unsavory intelligence agency, the SBU and that accepted Bellingcat’s dubious MH-17 evidence blaming the Russians . If such a Ministry of Truth had existed in the mid-1980s, it might well have denounced the investigative reporting on the Contra-cocaine scandal since that was initially deemed untrue. And if “Minitrue” were around in 2002-03, it almost surely would have decried the handful of people who were warning against the “group think” on Iraq’s WMD. Power and Reality While it’s undeniable that some false or dubious stories get pushed during the heat of a political campaign and in wartime – and journalists have a role in fact-checking as best they can – there is potentially a greater danger when media insiders arrogate to themselves the power to dismiss contrary evidence as unacceptable, especially given their own history of publishing stories that turned out to be dubious if not entirely false. It’s even more dangerous when these self-appointed arbiters of truth combine forces with powerful Internet search engines and social media companies to essentially silence dissenting opinions and contrary facts by making them very difficult for the public to locate. Arguably even worse is when politicians – whether President-elect Donald Trump or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or President Obama – get into the business of judging what is true and what is false. On Thursday, an impassioned President Obama voiced his annoyance with “fake news” twice in his joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel — “because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television. … If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.” Let that phrase sink in for a moment: “We won’t know what to protect”? Is President Obama suggesting that it is the U.S. government’s role to “protect” certain information and, by implication, leave contrary information “unprotected,” i.e. open to censorship? On Friday, a New York Times front-page article took Facebook to task, in particular, writing: “for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news.” The Times added, in a complimentary way, “Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late.” Info-War This new alarm about “fake news” comes amid the U.S. government’s “information war” against Russia regarding the Syrian and Ukraine conflicts. Obama’s State Department insists that it is presenting the truth about these conflicts while Russia’s RT channel is a fount of disinformation. Yet, the State Department’s propaganda officials have frequently made false or unsupported claims themselves. Ukraine’s (now-former) Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk On Wednesday, there was the unseemly scene of State Department spokesman John Kirby refusing to answer reasonable questions from a Russian journalist affiliated with RT. The RT journalist asked Kirby to identify the hospitals and clinics in Syria that he was claiming had been hit by Russian and Syrian airstrikes. You might assume that a truth-teller would have welcomed the opportunity to provide more details that could then be checked and verified. But instead Kirby berated the RT journalist and tried to turn the rest of the State Department press corps against her. QUESTION: Don’t you think it is important to give a specific list of hospitals that you’re accusing Russia of hitting? Those are grave accusations. KIRBY: I’m not making those accusations. I’m telling you we’ve seen reports from credible aid organizations that five hospitals and a clinic — QUESTION: Which hospital — KIRBY: At least one clinic — QUESTION: In what cities at least? KIRBY: You can go look at the information that many of the Syrian relief agencies are putting out there publicly. We’re getting our information from them too. These reports — QUESTION: But you are citing those reports without giving any specifics. KIRBY: Because we believe these agencies are credible and because we have other sources of information that back up what we’re seeing from some of these reports. And you know what? Why don’t [you] ask … Here’s a good question. Why don’t you ask your defense ministry … what they’re doing and see if you can get…” QUESTION: If you give a specific list — KIRBY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. QUESTION: If you give a specific list of hospitals — KIRBY: No, no, no. QUESTION: My colleagues who are listening hopefully would be able to go and ask Russian officials about a specific list of hospitals that you’re accusing Russia of …” KIRBY: You work for Russia Today, right? Isn’t that your agency? QUESTION: That is correct. Yes. KIRBY: And so why shouldn’t you ask your government the same kinds of questions that you’re standing here asking me? Ask them about their military activities. Get them to tell you what they’re – or to deny what they’re doing. QUESTION: When I ask for specifics, it seems your response is why are you here? Well, you are leveling that accusation. KIRBY: No, ma’am. QUESTION: And if you give specifics, my colleagues would be able to ask Russian officials. As Kirby continued to berate the RT journalist and stonewall her request for specifics, an American reporter intervened and objected to Kirby’s use of the phrase “‘your defense minister’ and things like that. I mean, she’s a journalist just like the rest of are, so it’s – she’s asking pointed questions, but they’re not …” Kirby then insisted that since RT was “a state-owned” outlet that its journalists should not be put “on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.” (But the reality is that Voice of America, BBC and many other Western outlets are financed by governments or have ideological benefactors.) Public Diplomacy Kirby’s hostility toward legitimate questions being raised about U.S. or U.S.-allied assertions has become typical of Obama’s State Department, which doesn’t seem to want any challenges to its presentation of reality. A screen shot of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland speaking to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013, at an event sponsored by Chevron, with its logo to Nuland’s left. For instance, during the early phase of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry called RT a “propaganda bullhorn” and Richard Stengel, Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, issued a “DipNote” saying RT should be ostracized as a source of disinformation. But Stengel’s complaint revealed a stunning ignorance about the circumstances surrounding the February 2014 putsch that overthrew Ukraine’s elected President Viktor Yanukovych. For instance, Stengel cited RT’s “ludicrous assertion” about the U.S. investing $5 billion to promote “regime change” in Ukraine. Stengel apparently wasn’t aware that Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland had cited the $5 billion figure in support of Ukraine’s “European aspirations” during a public speech to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013. At the time, Nuland was a leading proponent of “regime change” in Ukraine, personally cheering on the Maidan demonstrators and even passing out cookies. In an intercepted, obscenity-laced phone call with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland said her choice to lead Ukraine was Arseniy “Yats is the guy” Yatsenyuk, who ended up as Prime Minister after the coup. So, was Stengel a purveyor of “fake news” when he was accusing RT of disseminating fake news or was he just assembling some propaganda points for his underlings to repeat to a gullible Western news media. Or was he just ill-informed? Both democracy and journalism can be messy businesses – and credibility is something that must be earned over time by building a reputation for reliability. There is no “gold seal” from the Establishment that makes you trustworthy. It’s simply important to do one’s best to inform the American people and the world’s public as accurately as possible.

25,"WASHINGTON  —   Emboldened by their electoral prospects in November, Democrats are planning to redouble their efforts to make the fate of the Supreme Court a signature election issue, with the Democratic leader in the Senate threatening to stall Republican legislative priorities if no action is taken on the confirmation of Judge Merrick B. Garland. The Senate has been stuck in a stalemate since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February left a vacancy on the bench. Republicans have refused to hold confirmation hearings on President Obama’s nominee, insisting that the next president should make the choice. But with Donald J. Trump’s poll numbers sliding, the Democratic leadership sees an opening to derail Republicans who are facing   by blaming them for the delay. “We’re not going to back off,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader, said in an interview this week. “There will be things we are going to do to draw more attention to this. ” He predicted that the Republican presidential nominee’s prospects would decline further by next month, adding, “By then, they are going to have to look for some way to break from Donald Trump. ” Republicans find themselves in a precarious position on the issue. After insisting that voters should be allowed a voice on Judge Garland’s fate through the election of Mr. Obama’s successor, their nominee is now faltering and the Republican Senate majority is now in doubt. Adding to the pressure on Republicans to act is speculation that Hillary Clinton, if elected, could nominate someone who is more liberal than Judge Garland. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, has been adamant that Mr. Obama not be allowed to name a Supreme Court justice in his last year in office  —   a position he took when a Republican appeared more likely to win the White House. Reversing himself now would invite accusations that his position was based on politics, not principles, all along. Mr. Reid would not say what kinds of procedural moves Democrats might employ to pressure Republicans when Congress reconvenes in early September, but he suggested that there were plenty of options to stop up the Senate’s business, including some that Republicans have used. “They’ve blocked all legislation, they’ve blocked nominations, they’ve filibustered all kinds of things,” Mr. Reid said. “We haven’t done that, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do it when we come back. ” But time will be limited: Lawmakers will have just over a month to address issues such as a Zika funding bill, a stopgap measure to keep the government open and an annual defense policy bill before many of them return to the campaign trail in early October. Democrats have tried to drum up outrage around the court vacancy before, only to have attention fizzle under the glare of the presidential election and debates about trade, terrorism and immigration. White House officials said the president and his advisers would continue to make a public case for Judge Garland’s confirmation. Mr. Obama wrote an   in The Wall Street Journal on the subject in July, and aides said the president would push the issue even as he campaigns for Mrs. Clinton. “As soon as Republicans are ready to be done with their historic obstruction, we stand ready for a hearing and a vote,” said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman. In addition, a coalition of liberal interest groups will continue to demand a hearing for Judge Garland from the handful of Republican senators who face tough   fights this year. The hope is that the senators will feel pressure from their constituents and, in turn, urge Mr. McConnell to allow the nomination to proceed. But Mr. Obama’s Democratic allies concede that the message about Mr. Garland is being swamped by the presidential race, and that it has become only one small part of the campaign against the Republicans. Many now believe that Mr. Garland’s confirmation will not be resolved until after the election. Another obstacle is a lack of enthusiasm for Judge Garland among the Democratic Party’s progressive base. Adam Green, a   of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said that he was hopeful that Republicans would continue to block Judge Garland’s confirmation before the election and in the   period. With Mrs. Clinton’s improved prospects of winning, he said he hoped she would pick someone more liberal. “Garland was the most conservative pick a Democratic president could have made,” Mr. Green said. Neil Sroka, the communications director at Democracy for America, agreed, arguing that the party’s base is not excited about adding a moderate, white man to the court. “If Secretary Clinton wins the White House,” Mr. Sroka said, “she should absolutely swing for the fences. ” For her part, Mrs. Clinton has praised Judge Garland’s qualifications as a jurist and argued that Republicans should confirm him now, but she has avoided questions about whether she would renominate him if she wins. Some have speculated that she could nominate someone who is more liberal than Judge Garland, while others suggested she might stick with him to avoid a fight with Republicans. Asked this month if Judge Garland should be confirmed in the   period if Mrs. Clinton wins, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, her running mate, demurred but said he would vote for him if given the chance. “This will be for the president and the   to decide,” Mr. Kaine said on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “But look, if it comes up for a vote in the Senate, Merrick Garland gets so far over the hurdle of the fitness and character test that is supposed to be the legitimate question for nominees, of course I’d vote for him. ” Legal experts continue to consider different situations, such as a recess appointment by Mr. Obama or the possibility that he could renominate Judge Garland when the new Congress takes over in January before he departs. A vote in the   period, however, appears to be the most realistic possibility. “If Hillary Clinton were to prevail, I think the odds are pretty good that Garland would be confirmed in lame duck,” said David B. Rivkin Jr. a constitutional litigator who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Rivkin said Judge Garland should be a relatively palatable pick for Republicans. Despite Mr. Trump’s recent controversies and his slip in national and state polls, the Republican leadership is still holding firm that confirmation hearings will not happen this year regardless of the outcome of the presidential election. “No, we’re not going to confirm Garland this year,” Mr. McConnell told a Kentucky television station this week. “Whoever the next president is will get to make that appointment. ” Mr. McConnell said that he would stick to that position, even if it meant Mrs. Clinton picking a more liberal judge. “I think the next president will have been chosen by the American people to make this appointment, and we have to live with whoever is ultimately chosen,” he said. But some Senate Republicans have expressed a desire for more flexibility. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said in June that he thought a vote should be allowed if it appears that Mr. Trump is going to lose the election. Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois have also said that hearings should move forward. Mr. Reid predicts that such sentiment will become more common if Mr. Trump proves to be a drag on other candidates on the ballot and if he continues to make missteps. He said that Mr. McConnell’s intransigence was improving the chances for Democratic candidates in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and that he expected Democrats to retake control of the Senate. “If they have this death wish, and that’s what it is,” Mr. Reid said, “they are going to end up losing really, really big. ”",,1326,24.10909090909091,55,0.32277526395173456,0,0,0,0,88.06940646080918,3.9854546157713573,75.85492081447964,39.233611787910434,0.7782805429864253,0.01583710407239819,0.038461538461538464,0.027149321266968326,0.03619909502262444,0.012066365007541479,0.167420814479638,0.005279034690799397,0.006033182503770739,0.020361990950226245,0.08446455505279035,0.0007541478129713424,0.08597285067873303,0.003770739064856712,0.0007541478129713424,0.01583710407239819,0.003770739064856712,0.1085972850678733,0.0007541478129713424,0.05580693815987934,0.020361990950226245,0.04751131221719457,0,0.0015082956259426848,0.03544494720965309,0.033936651583710405,0.12141779788838612,0,0,0.0030165912518853697,0.010558069381598794,0,0.024886877828054297,0.03770739064856712,0.0007541478129713424,0.0007541478129713424,0.46681749622926094,0.0015082956259426848,0.01809954751131222,0.003770739064856712,0.0022624434389140274,0.049773755656108594,0.0022624434389140274,0.0007541478129713424,0.014328808446455505,0.010558069381598794,0.005279034690799397,0.03695324283559578,0.003770739064856712,0.015082956259426848,0.00980392156862745,0.013574660633484163,0.0015082956259426848,0,0.0007541478129713424,0.21945701357466063,0.0015082956259426848,0,0.032428355957767725,0.06184012066365008,0.042986425339366516,0.04524886877828054,0.021116138763197588,0.08748114630467571,0.13650075414781296,0.09502262443438914,0.021870286576168928,0,0.027149321266968326,0.11312217194570136,0,0.01282051282051282,0.006787330316742082,0.0022624434389140274,0.00980392156862745,0,0.0007541478129713424,0.026395173453996983,0.11161387631975868,0.05052790346907994,0,0.03167420814479638,0.010558069381598794,0.049019607843137254,0.14856711915535445,0.15610859728506787,0.006033182503770739,0.030165912518853696,0,26.25,0,70,6,1,14,35.25,10,18.875,54,3.75,31.175,5,0,26.25,2,66.425,53.25,149,264.675,66.425,,0.4417983451699892,0,0.6785164859871632,0.15319312727568044,0.029268651413606912,0.29682242328512826,0.515228488555697,0.23166247903553996,0.36269307060008044,0.6195058442775794,0.101581287724503,0.48452588371818,0.13100580420257674,0,0.457768801580734,0.0568727151524708,0.044204501971484185,0.03543680436554811,0.09915650423411583,0.17613589099439333,-0.7788104787499585,0.8238641090056067,88
26,"Has the United States mismanaged the ascent of China? By April 15, the Treasury Department is required to present to Congress a report on the exchange rate policies of the country’s major trading partners, intended to identify manipulators that cheapen their currency to make their exports more attractive and gain market share in the United States, a designation that could eventually lead to retaliation. It would be hard, these days, to find an economist who feels China fits the bill. Under a trade law passed in 2015, a country must meet three criteria: It would have to have a “material” trade surplus with the rest of the world, have a “significant” surplus with the United States, and intervene persistently in foreign exchange markets to push its currency in one direction. While China’s surplus with the United States is pretty big  —   almost $350 billion  —   its global surplus is modest, at 2. 4 percent of its gross domestic product last year. Most significant, it has been pushing its currency up, not down. Since the middle of 2014 it has sold over $1 trillion from its reserves to prop up the renminbi, under pressure from capital flight by Chinese companies and savers. Even President Trump  —   who as a candidate promised to label China a currency manipulator on Day 1 and put a 45 percent tariff on imports of Chinese goods  —   seems to be backing away from broad, immediate retaliation. And yet the temptation remains. “When you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations,” the Chinese “are world champions,” Mr. Trump told The Financial Times, ahead of the state visit of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to the United States last week. For all Mr. Trump’s random impulsiveness and bluster  —   and despite his lack of a coherent strategy to engage with what is likely soon to become the world’s biggest economy  —   he is not entirely alone with his views. Many learned economists and policy experts ruefully acknowledge that the president’s intuition is broadly right: While labeling China a currency manipulator now would look ridiculous, the United States should have done it a long time ago. “With the benefit of hindsight, China should have been named,” said Brad Setser, an expert on international economics and finance who worked in the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. There were reasonable arguments against putting China on the spot and starting a process that could eventually lead to American retaliation. Yet by not pushing back against China’s currency manipulation, and allowing China to deploy an arsenal of trade tactics of dubious legality to increase exports to the United States, successive administrations  —   Republican and Democratic  —   arguably contributed to the economic dislocations that pummeled so many American workers over more than a decade. Those dislocations helped propel Mr. Trump to power. From 2000 to 2014 China definitely suppressed the rise of the renminbi to maintain a competitive advantage for its exports, buying dollars hand over fist and adding $4 trillion to its foreign reserves over the period. Until 2005, the Chinese government kept the renminbi pegged to the dollar, following it down as the greenback slid against other major currencies starting in 2003. American multinationals were flocking into China, taking advantage of its entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, which guaranteed access to the American and other world markets for its exports. By 2007, China’s broad trade surplus hit 10 percent of its gross domestic product  —   an   imbalance for an economy this large. And its surplus with the United States amounted to a full third of the American deficit with the world. Though the requirement that the Treasury identify currency manipulators “gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade” dates back to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, China was never called out. There were good reasons. Or at least they seemed so at the time. For one, China hands in the administration of George W. Bush argued that putting China on the spot would make negotiations more difficult, because even Chinese leaders who understood the need to allow their currency to rise could not be seen to bow to American pressure. Labeling China a manipulator could have severely hindered progress in other areas of a complex bilateral economic relationship. And the United States had bigger fish to fry. “There were other dimensions of China’s economic policies that were seen as more important to U. S. economic and business interests,” Eswar Prasad, who headed the China desk at the International Monetary Fund and is now a professor at Cornell, told me. These included “greater market access, better intellectual property rights protection, easier access to investment opportunities, etc. ” At the end of the day, economists argued at the time, Chinese exchange rate policies didn’t cost the United States much. After all, in 2007 the United States was operating at full employment. The trade deficit was because of Americans’ dismal savings rate and supercharged consumption, not a cheap renminbi. After all, if Americans wanted to consume more than they created, they had to get it somewhere. And the United States had a stake in China’s rise. A crucial strategic goal of American foreign policy since Mao’s death had been how to peacefully incorporate China into the existing order of   economies, bound by international law into the fabric of the postwar multilateral institutions. And the strategy even worked  —   a little bit. China did allow its currency to rise a little from 2005 to 2008. And when the financial crisis hit, it took the foot off the export pedal and deployed a giant fiscal stimulus, which bolstered internal demand. Yet though these arguments may all be true, they omitted an important consideration: The overhaul of the world economy imposed by China’s global rise also created losers. In a set of influential papers that have come to inform the thinking about the United States’ relations with China, David Autor, Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Gordon Hanson from the University of California, San Diego and David Dorn from the University of Zurich concluded that lots of American workers, in many communities, suffered a blow from which they never recovered. Rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2. 4 million American jobs, one paper estimated. Another found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year. Economic theory posited that a developed country like the United States would adjust to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that competed successfully in global markets. In the real world of American workers exposed to the rush of imports after China erupted onto world markets, the adjustment didn’t happen. If mediocre job prospects and low wages didn’t stop American families from consuming, it was because the American financial system was flush with Chinese cash and willing to lend, financing their homes and refinancing them to buy the furniture. But that equilibrium didn’t end well either, did it? What it left was a lot of betrayed anger floating around among many Americans on the wrong end of these dynamics. “By not following the law, the administration sent a political signal that the U. S. wouldn’t stand up to Chinese cheating,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “As we can see now, that hurt in terms of maintaining political support for open trade. ” If there was a winner from this dynamic, it was Mr. Trump. Will Mr. Trump really go after China? In addition to an expected executive order to retaliate against the dumping of Chinese steel, he has promised more. He could tinker with the definitions of “material” and “significant” trade surpluses to justify a manipulation charge. And yet a charge of manipulation would add irony upon irony. “It would be incredibly ironic not to have named China a manipulator when it was manipulating, and name it when it is not,” Mr. Setser told me. And Mr. Trump would be retaliating against the economic dynamic that handed him the presidency.",,1363,21.634920634920636,63,0.3573000733675715,0,0,0,0,96.37984568622866,21.965531627177654,54.38659066538744,36.05654946667419,0.7887013939838592,0.029347028613352897,0.036683785766691124,0.030814380044020543,0.03888481291269259,0.007336757153338224,0.14600146735143066,0.00586940572267058,0.001467351430667645,0.013206162876008804,0.09391049156272928,0,0.05649303008070433,0.003668378576669112,0.0022010271460014674,0.02421129860601614,0.009537784299339692,0.09684519442406456,0.0022010271460014674,0.049889948642699924,0.019809244314013204,0.04402054292002935,0,0.0007336757153338225,0.025678650036683785,0.01760821716801174,0.10491562729273661,0,0.0007336757153338225,0.003668378576669112,0,0,0.00586940572267058,0.0425531914893617,0.001467351430667645,0.001467351430667645,0.4402054292002935,0.0007336757153338225,0.001467351430667645,0.003668378576669112,0.001467351430667645,0.0491562729273661,0.0022010271460014674,0.0007336757153338225,0.016874541452677916,0.01173881144534116,0.0007336757153338225,0.010271460014673514,0.05355832721936904,0.02127659574468085,0.011005135730007337,0.016140865737344093,0.001467351430667645,0.0007336757153338225,0.025678650036683785,0.1892883345561262,0.010271460014673514,0,0.009537784299339692,0.0491562729273661,0.10858400586940573,0.016874541452677916,0.022010271460014674,0.06676449009537784,0.15774027879677183,0.06676449009537784,0.02127659574468085,0.0022010271460014674,0.019075568598679385,0.14159941305942772,0,0.016874541452677916,0.00586940572267058,0.003668378576669112,0.003668378576669112,0,0,0.004402054292002935,0.04548789435069699,0.08143800440205429,0,0.012472487160674981,0.007336757153338224,0.0425531914893617,0.09024211298606016,0.10051357300073367,0.0007336757153338225,0.08070432868672046,0.00293470286133529,44,0,108.45,0,16,6,26.25,41,33,31,25.25,6,12.25,8,44,0,117.75,34.25,191.95,340.95,117.75,,0.5534836350025168,0,0.7534050223422137,0,0.3107008557545449,0.14459058185587106,0.42512545740679064,0.5359723832719583,0.4817765909574501,0.4661900991857143,0.41566195343241985,0.14459058185587106,0.25656342276733757,0.18392293443878058,0.5202950285893755,0,0.07387308259355689,0.02148749960789234,0.1204241036418959,0.21390256908936917,-0.7472321133092574,0.7860974309106308,110

28,"BEIJING  —   After approving plans on Friday for informal talks in New York between a North Korean delegation and former American officials, the Trump administration reversed course hours later, withdrawing approval for the North Koreans’ visas, two people who were to take part in the planned talks said. The schedule called for the two sides to meet in early March, and arrangements were underway for the   North Korean group, led by Choe   who runs the American affairs bureau of the North’s Foreign Ministry, to travel to New York. The organizer of the talks, the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, led by Donald S. Zagoria, was told by the State Department on Friday morning that the visas would be granted. But the decision was reversed in the afternoon when “someone overruled State,” said one person who planned to participate in the talks. Both of the people on the participants’ list spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. The reversal came as the Malaysian government announced that VX nerve agent, a chemical on a United Nations list of weapons of mass destruction, was used to kill the estranged half brother of the leader of North Korea at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. South Korea has accused North Korea’s leader, Kim   of ordering the killing of his half brother, Kim  . Just days before Mr. Kim’s death, North Korea launched a new type of   missile, apparently timed to coincide with the visit of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to the United States. News of the missile test arrived as President Trump and Mr. Abe were eating dinner at    the president’s   club in Palm Beach, Fla. At first, the North Korea developments did not appear to deter the State Department’s plan to move ahead with the talks. The use of the VX nerve agent was already known when Mr. Zagoria got the green light about the visas on Friday morning. The missile test was on Feb. 11. The State Department also knew about tough comments Mr. Trump made about the North Korean leader during an interview with Reuters on Thursday. “It’s very late,” Mr. Trump said when asked whether he would meet with Mr. Kim. “We’re very angry at what he’s done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration. ” The decision to reverse the initial approval for the visas came hours later on Friday afternoon, one of the people who planned to take part in the talks said. But it was clear, that person said, that a senior official in the State Department, the White House or elsewhere in the government had second thoughts about issuing visas to representatives of North Korea in light of recent events. “I suspect it was a combination of the VX attack and the president’s personal pique that caused the reversal,” the person said. “Someone obviously looked at the fact that the United States was going to issue visas to representatives of a country that had just violated international law, carried out a murder and intentionally violated the sovereignty of another country, and decided, ‘Maybe this isn’t such a good idea. ’” While the talks were unofficial, they were seen as a test of the willingness of the Trump administration to begin serious negotiations at a later date, or to send a special American envoy to North Korea. Several prominent nuclear weapons experts have urged Mr. Trump to send an envoy, arguing that President Barack Obama’s refusal to engage with the North allowed it to make significant advances in its nuclear weapons program. “Every six to seven weeks North Korea may be able to add another nuclear weapon to its arsenal,” Siegfried S. Hecker, emeritus director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said in a recent   article. The leader of the North Korean delegation, Ms. Choe, planned to travel to New York in her “nongovernmental” role as president of North Korea’s Institute for American Studies. The American participants were mostly former officials who had dealt with North Korea over many years. Some of them have participated in similar gatherings with North Koreans organized outside the United States. But more weight was given to the New York gathering because it was taking place at the start of the new administration. During his election campaign, Mr. Trump said he was open to meeting with the North Korean leader over a hamburger. The Americans in the group represented a wide range of views on North Korea. Winston Lord, a former ambassador to China who was on the list of participants, recently wrote in a dissent to a report for the Asia Society that the United States should immediately step up sanctions on North Korea. Others in the American delegation were Robert L. Gallucci, a negotiator on North Korea during the Clinton presidency Victor Cha, a senior adviser on North Korea to George W. Bush and Evans J. R. Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state specializing in North Korea. Mr. Gallucci and Mr. Cha wrote a report for the George W. Bush Institute last year that emphasized the human rights abuses in North Korea. As well as holding discussions about the North’s rapidly expanding nuclear program, the American delegation was planning to talk with the North Koreans about two Americans now detained in North Korea.",,917,22.925,40,0.31624863685932386,0,0,0,0,99,40.25449654671028,81.14365292227887,16.421155943293346,0.7960741548527808,0.018538713195201745,0.04798255179934569,0.023991275899672846,0.028353326063249727,0.011995637949836423,0.13849509269356597,0.015267175572519083,0,0.017448200654307525,0.11777535441657579,0,0.04362050163576881,0.007633587786259542,0.003271537622682661,0.013086150490730643,0.0054525627044711015,0.05016357688113413,0,0.04689203925845147,0.021810250817884406,0.03271537622682661,0,0.004362050163576881,0.009814612868047983,0.004362050163576881,0.09814612868047982,0,0.0021810250817884407,0.0021810250817884407,0.0021810250817884407,0,0.006543075245365322,0.06761177753544166,0.0021810250817884407,0.0021810250817884407,0.4154852780806979,0.0010905125408942203,0.009814612868047983,0.0010905125408942203,0.0010905125408942203,0.03380588876772083,0.0021810250817884407,0.003271537622682661,0.008724100327153763,0.011995637949836423,0.004362050163576881,0.019629225736095966,0.006543075245365322,0.018538713195201745,0.0021810250817884407,0.016357688113413305,0.0010905125408942203,0.0010905125408942203,0.014176663031624863,0.193020719738277,0.0010905125408942203,0,0.021810250817884406,0.05670665212649945,0.0861504907306434,0.010905125408942203,0.009814612868047983,0.06543075245365322,0.17121046892039257,0.04471101417666303,0.014176663031624863,0,0.016357688113413305,0.18647764449291168,0.003271537622682661,0.009814612868047983,0.0010905125408942203,0,0.009814612868047983,0,0,0.006543075245365322,0.10032715376226826,0.10359869138495092,0,0.010905125408942203,0.0021810250817884407,0.064340239912759,0.11450381679389313,0.10577971646673937,0.0010905125408942203,0.06652126499454744,0,8,0,101.25,1,1,5,0,9,1.83,28.625,8,0,11,0,8,0,31.83,5,117.875,154.70499999999998,31.83,,0.2204812092115424,0,0.7816464247254866,0.03414802408943918,0.03414802408943918,0.15022110482233483,0,0.24138865261078873,0.06076853014180898,0.502993613738757,0.2204812092115424,0,0.28001028530497923,0,0.2730711642586491,0,0.030762391212954418,0.004832295195248888,0.11392135922799253,0.14951604563619583,-0.8114008204064312,0.8504839543638042,37
29,"The Folketing, Denmark’s unicameral parliament, has passed a resolution stating that Danes should not become minorities in Danish communities, as figures show the migrant and   population are now a majority in Brøndby Strand and Odense. [“Parliament notes with concern that today there are areas in Denmark where the number of immigrants from   countries and their descendants is over 50 percent,” the resolution states.  “It is parliament’s opinion that Danes should not be a minority in residential areas in Denmark. ” Denmark, like many other European countries, saw a surge in sexual assaults and harassment by migrants after they began to arrive in large numbers. Rafi Ibrahim, a Syrian who has been settled in Denmark for many years, told reporters that the new arrivals find it difficult to control themselves around Western women. “If they see a girl, they go nuts. They simply can’t handle it,” he said. “In Syria and many other countries, it is not normal for a strange woman to smile at you. Those girls who are harassed aren’t necessarily   or drunk. Sometimes it is enough just to be a girl. ” Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg confessed in late 2016 that “integration in Denmark has failed” following a damning report on criminality and unemployment in   increasingly   ghettoes. “In my opinion it is because we have been too scared to set out clear demands to the people coming to Denmark,” she said. “We have not dared to say that we expect and demand that they provide for themselves and their families, and that we expect them to adjust to Danish values. ” Indigenous Britons were officially recorded as a minority in the nation’s capital for the first time in 2011, with just 44. 9 per cent of Londoners identifying as “White British” in the 2011 census. White Britons are also under 50 per cent of the population in Leicester, Luton, and Slough, with Manchester University researchers predicting that Birmingham, the UK’s second city, will soon follow suit.",,332,20.75,16,0.35240963855421686,0,0,0,0,83.65193631669536,38.68659252394193,71.6429718875502,6.017538508464235,0.7951807228915663,0.006024096385542169,0.04216867469879518,0.030120481927710843,0.030120481927710843,0.018072289156626505,0.1746987951807229,0.012048192771084338,0.0030120481927710845,0.018072289156626505,0.06325301204819277,0,0.07228915662650602,0.006024096385542169,0,0.006024096385542169,0.006024096385542169,0.08734939759036145,0,0.0572289156626506,0.015060240963855422,0.05120481927710843,0,0,0.03313253012048193,0.015060240963855422,0.07228915662650602,0,0.0030120481927710845,0,0.018072289156626505,0,0.018072289156626505,0.030120481927710843,0,0,0.4819277108433735,0,0.009036144578313253,0.006024096385542169,0.0030120481927710845,0.060240963855421686,0.0030120481927710845,0.0030120481927710845,0.02108433734939759,0.009036144578313253,0.006024096385542169,0.0030120481927710845,0.006024096385542169,0.024096385542168676,0.018072289156626505,0.024096385542168676,0,0,0.02710843373493976,0.21385542168674698,0.0030120481927710845,0,0.02710843373493976,0.04819277108433735,0.0391566265060241,0.05421686746987952,0.006024096385542169,0.04216867469879518,0.15060240963855423,0.1144578313253012,0.015060240963855422,0,0.04819277108433735,0.1566265060240964,0.006024096385542169,0.0030120481927710845,0.009036144578313253,0.0030120481927710845,0.018072289156626505,0,0.0030120481927710845,0.006024096385542169,0.09939759036144578,0.09939759036144578,0.0030120481927710845,0.015060240963855422,0.030120481927710843,0.03313253012048193,0.13253012048192772,0.11746987951807229,0.012048192771084338,0.018072289156626505,0.0030120481927710845,4,0,24,1,0,5,0,5,0,20,7,5,6,0,4,0,15,5,59,79,15,,0.1827439976315568,0,0.5729490168751578,0.05294214363635836,0,0.21844989525420877,0,0.21844989525420877,0,0.5278640450004206,0.28125389940955065,0.21844989525420877,0.2511664187323588,0,0.4721359549995794,0,0.03865979381443299,0.01288659793814433,0.15206185567010308,0.2036082474226804,-0.7767112228661966,0.7963917525773196,23

31,"Israeli official secretly visits Dubai: Report ‹ › GPD is our General Posting Department whereby we share posts from other sources along with general information with our readers. It is managed by our Editorial Board I thought I was just scared of Trump – but it’s his America I fear By GPD on November 4, 2016 Misogyny, racism and bigotry won’t go away if Donald Trump loses next week’s election; it was already here before he drew it out into the mainstream ‘Even if Trump loses, this isn’t simply a bad dream that we’ll awaken from on 9 November.’ Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP by Jessica Valenti W ith the presidential election less than a week away, my once-composed optimism has given way to panic. Sheer, stomach-churning panic. You see, up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Trump winning. But as election day looms closer, and the racism and sexism that infects Trump’s campaign is ratcheted up, it’s hard not to be terrified. In the past week, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper endorsed Trump and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation. Trump rally-goers shouted antisemitic invective at reporters, and a historically black church in Mississippi was burned and “vote Trump” scrawled across the side. Another woman came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault , and a Texas official called Hillary Clinton a “cunt”. This isn’t a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans; it’s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why it’s been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend there’s no way that he could actually win the presidency.

32,"CAIRO  —     Libyan militias backed by American air power said Wednesday that they had seized the Islamic State’s last stronghold in the country, in the seaside city of Surt. If confirmed, the capture would be a severe blow to the militant organization’s expansion into North Africa, and extend the string of territorial retreats it has suffered this year in Syria and Iraq. Militia announcements quoted by Libyan news agencies and television outlets said the militia fighters were still hunting remnants of the Islamic State forces hiding in residential neighborhoods in Surt. But the militias claimed to have taken the heavily fortified Ouagadougou Center, which the Islamic State had used as its headquarters. In a statement broadcast on Misurata TV, a station based in the nearby city of Misurata, Mohamed   a spokesman for the attacking militia force, said that the Ouagadougou Center and a nearby hospital had been captured.   TV, a Libyan broadcaster, posted on its Twitter account photos of what appeared to be triumphal fighters outside the center posing with their flag. The center was heavily fortified, with underground bunkers and fortifications dating from the era of Col. Muammar   the longtime leader of Libya overthrown nearly five years ago. The Islamic State’s loss of Surt would signify the culmination of a   offensive by militias from Misurata, under the auspices of the Government of National Accord, the   authority backed by the United Nations. It comes against the backdrop of other military setbacks for the Islamic State, which once held wide areas of Syria and Iraq but has been forced to relinquish territory in recent months. Iraqi forces retook control of the city of Falluja from the Islamic State in June. The Syrian Army, backed by Russia, expelled the Islamic State from the ancient city of Palmyra in March. Syrian insurgents and Kurdish militias, including some   factions, have been squeezing Islamic State positions in northeast Syria near Raqqa, the organization’s headquarters. Over the last 10 days, the militias fighting the Islamic State in Libya have been supported by heavy American airstrikes, using drones based in Jordan. The United States Africa Command has reported 28 airstrikes from the beginning of that campaign, Aug. 1, to Monday. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had held Surt for the past year. Its occupation of the city represented the organization’s most brazen expansion from its power bases in Iraq and Syria. While the American military did not specify exactly where its airstrikes had been aimed, it is believed that they were concentrated in and around Surt. The militias’ offensive against the Islamic State had reduced the area they controlled from 150 miles of coastline to the area immediately around the city. The birthplace of Colonel Qaddafi, Surt is also where the Libyan dictator was killed by antigovernment militia fighters in 2011. Officials at the Pentagon said they could not confirm that the Islamic State’s headquarters in Surt had fallen, but one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity under military rules, said he had no reports suggesting the militia claims were untrue. Libya’s hodgepodge of militias, answering to three different factions claiming to control the country, have often been prone to exaggerated claims.   factions also reported that a Libyan Air Force warplane had been shot down by Islamic State fighters in Surt on Wednesday. The territory seized by the Islamic State in Libya had been considered the most important of the group’s overseas wilayats, or provinces. As early as October 2014, extremists in the Libyan city of Darnah pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and a month later, the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr   named Libya as one of the group’s official provinces. That province was eventually centered in Surt, which became the axis of the Islamic State’s power in Libya. The organization sought to give its Libya province the trappings of a state, modeled after the one it was trying to run in Iraq and Syria. Early on, senior Islamic State members arrived by boat to help administer the territory, creating a degree of connective tissue that has mostly been lacking in other areas the group has seized. The Islamic State set up offices mirroring those in Syria, including a media office, which put out content tailored to a Libyan audience, according to Aymenn Jawad   a research fellow at the Middle East Forum. The production techniques used in execution videos produced in Libya were so similar to ones emerging from Syria that some experts theorized that the Islamic State must have dispatched a cameraman from Syria to Libya to achieve that congruence. The latest developments in Surt came as the Government of National Accord has been struggling with other resilient threats to Libya’s frail stability. Fears have risen that militias in eastern Libya that have refused to recognize the government could attack the Zueitina oil export terminal, where Libya petroleum officials hope to resume disrupted shipments. The governments of France, Britain, Spain, Germany and the United States on Wednesday issued a statement expressing “concern at reports of increasing tension” near Zueitina and supporting the government’s efforts to “resolve the disruptions to Libya’s energy exports. ”",,864,24.685714285714287,35,0.38425925925925924,0,0,0,0,98.9287270463741,29.151340996168578,57.79843304843305,12.085034013605442,0.7152777777777778,0.011574074074074073,0.02546296296296296,0.017361111111111112,0.028935185185185185,0.009259259259259259,0.11574074074074074,0.01273148148148148,0.004629629629629629,0.016203703703703703,0.1111111111111111,0,0.059027777777777776,0.003472222222222222,0.0011574074074074073,0.018518518518518517,0.0023148148148148147,0.06828703703703703,0,0.05439814814814815,0.017361111111111112,0.034722222222222224,0,0.0023148148148148147,0.016203703703703703,0.009259259259259259,0.0798611111111111,0,0,0.003472222222222222,0,0,0.0023148148148148147,0.0625,0.0023148148148148147,0.0023148148148148147,0.41898148148148145,0.0011574074074074073,0.008101851851851851,0.0023148148148148147,0,0.03819444444444445,0.0011574074074074073,0.0011574074074074073,0.01273148148148148,0.009259259259259259,0.008101851851851851,0.0023148148148148147,0.0011574074074074073,0.009259259259259259,0.003472222222222222,0.019675925925925927,0.0011574074074074073,0,0.013888888888888888,0.1527777777777778,0.0011574074074074073,0,0.017361111111111112,0.03935185185185185,0.06944444444444445,0.006944444444444444,0.009259259259259259,0.05555555555555555,0.16203703703703703,0.04513888888888889,0.008101851851851851,0,0.004629629629629629,0.15856481481481483,0.023148148148148147,0.006944444444444444,0.005787037037037037,0.0023148148148148147,0.004629629629629629,0,0,0.0011574074074074073,0.03935185185185185,0.1087962962962963,0,0.016203703703703703,0.005787037037037037,0.041666666666666664,0.08796296296296297,0.09837962962962964,0,0.032407407407407406,0,7.675,0,47,2,3,0,5,33.35,7.83,33,5,2,6,0,7.675,0,35.505,5,127.35,162.18,35.505,,0.22485891897617621,0,0.639825635387437,0.07028021008806296,0.10184159092899815,0,0.15894454156034005,0.5576222495374683,0.2283630187681611,0.5550181679914784,0.15894454156034005,0.07028021008806296,0.1848570461805353,0,0.4858377035486353,0,0.036297000552045634,0.005111533664560714,0.13019076243636138,0.16579770594369134,-0.8307758416530794,0.8342022940563086,48
33,"Home This Month Popular The Path Men Took To Trump The Path Men Took To Trump Daryush ""Roosh"" Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 20, 2016 Politics Every man who supports Donald Trump came to it from a different path. Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women . The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center In March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewish-operated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths I’ve learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door. I decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it. It is clear that gender hate is now a one-way street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women can’t. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women can’t. Men can be misogynist, but women can’t be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect as-is in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to pound-me-in-the-ass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If you’re a man, you’re likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you don’t yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around. Fast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles I’ve ever published: What Is A Social Justice Warrior (SJW) ? The article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and you’ll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes. I was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking we’d need a full generation (25+ years) to even begin defeating such a powerful anti-American entity . I focused on teaching men self-defense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors haven’t gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them. Though SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that I’m still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platforms—while you’re still here participating—shows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump. Donald Trump ground zero I’m a pessimist by nature, so I didn’t have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldn’t be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , out-compete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe. The ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have. After significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers don’t nitpick on who was the “best” soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General (Donald Trump), the Colonels (his advisers), the Captains (major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich), the Sergeants (men like myself), the Specialists (men like Samseau), and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time. The ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourth-generational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free open-source software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it. Approaching the date of the election Two months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesn’t Win, We’re Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency. Obama was the “race” president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the “gender” president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump. Not only will she move to establish a techno-matriarchy where men are second-class citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isn’t a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtube—many of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment. For the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they “let” him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a “ pro-rape advocate .” I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillary’s failing campaign. I spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned: in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trump’s candidacy? Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness? Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down. The first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trump’s support didn’t decline. The fake controversy didn’t work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the n-word, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug. From that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didn’t have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space. Human control is a foolhardy endeavor The most important lesson I learned from Trump’s victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination. George Soros and his billions weren’t effective. Obama and his allies weren’t effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets weren’t effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States weren’t effective. Hollywood and it’s superstars weren’t effective. Academia and it’s thousands of professors weren’t effective. Social media and its censorship efforts weren’t effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasn’t effective. Even Donald Trump’s own party wasn’t effective in stopping him. It’s absolutely incredible that all these forces couldn’t stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably! Think right now of how much effort the anti-Trump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public. Whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existence—nature, God, Tao, or so on—it is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing. Now they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled. You can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you don’t possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes. If you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness. Conclusion We are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone! Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we won’t allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes. I’m afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I can’t wait to see where this fight takes us next.

34,"By Robert Fisk on November 6, 2016 Robert Fisk — The Independent Nov 4, 2016 Syrian soldiers stand before their tanks at Quneitra, a few hundred metres from the front line with Nusrah Islamists and only five miles from Israeli troops on the Golan Heights. Click to enlarge From Colonel Saleh’s forward position on his front line north of Quneitra, he has a unique and exclusive view of the Syrian war. To his west and south is a vast area of his country which is occupied by Jabhat al-Nusra Islamist fighters – their earthen ramparts and supply roads are scarcely half a mile away. Then, another couple of miles away, Israeli soldiers are inside their concrete positions on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, above the old and Nusra-held Syrian city of Quneitra. “You see that mosque over there, just to the right of the water tower?” the colonel asks. “Well, Nusra is there. And you see the triangular hill beyond? The Israelis are there.” It’s what you call a politically intriguing battlefield – yes, shells do come whizzing in towards the Syrians from Nusra and also from the Israelis. The Syrians concentrate their fire on Nusra but Nusra’s casualties are often taken through the Israeli lines for hospital treatment in Haifa. So whose side is Israel on? Baath City is a concrete conurbation created back in pre-civil war days to defy the vandalisation of the old Quenitra. It was occupied by the Israeli army during the 1973 Middle East war and then – before they abandoned it under the Kissinger agreement – totally destroyed with explosives by Israeli troops. Nusra now occupy these 43-year old ruins. As for Baath City, its university, banks, fire station, schools, police force and hospitals are defiantly maintained by the Syrians under the eyes of their two enemies: the Nusra Islamists and the Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits a military field hospital in the Golan Heights medical facility where wounded “Syrian rebels” are being treated. Click to enlarge According to the Syrian army in Baath City – their forward lines and tanks are positioned in unfinished apartment blocks on the edge of the town – their intelligence department’s Hebrew speakers constantly monitor conversations between the Israelis and between Israeli and Nusra fighters. They know – and the Israelis have made no secret of the fact – that wounded Nusrah fighters are taken to Haifa for hospital treatment. On one occasion, a Nusrah man travelling in an Israeli ambulance on the Golan was dragged from the vehicle and lynched by a crowd of enraged Druze men who are largely loyal to the Syrian government and regard Nusrah as their mortal enemies. Reports of the man’s murder highlighted the highly ambiguous relationship between Israel and the Islamists, whose name-changing cannot conceal their al-Qaeda roots. Druze towns inside Syria and close to Baath City have taken the side of the regime – this does not apply to other Druze areas – but it makes the geography of the front line here all the more surreal. One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Nusra-occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel – whether there were any Israeli personnel inside it if it was hit is another matter. The Syrians, however, also say that Israeli bulldozers were used to build a new supply route for Nusrah between Quneitra and Golan – again, inside Syria’s frontiers. All of which raises a compelling question. The Nusra-controlled territory between the Syrians and the Israeli lines on Golan – and other Islamist groups and a few remnants of the old “Free Syrian Army” allied to them in this location – stretches all the way south to the edge of the Syrian city of Deraa and right down to the Jordanian frontier. And beyond that frontier is the so-called “Military Operations Centre” – the “MOC” of which both the Islamists and the Syrian army refer – where Western intelligence officers maintain a liaison and weapons supply depot for the anti-government Syrian forces. So what is the relationship between the MOC and its Western backers – who maintain contact with Nusra – and the Israelis who treat Nusra’s wounded in their hospitals? The Jordanian border and the Israeli lines on Golan are at their most only about 70 miles apart and opposition fighters hold all the land in between. Littered around the front lines outside Baath City are the wreckage of past battles and the abandoned UN posts from which Filipino UN soldiers were kidnapped en masse more than a year ago; the Syrian army now occupies several of these positions, the UN logo still painted on the walls although several of the “igloo”-type UN accommodation huts have migrated to Syrian compounds in the rear lines. The UN force on Golan now operates only inside Israeli-occupied territory. Only a few hundred yards away from Nusra-held territory, we found Abu Hashem, a farmer who fled from his village, now held by the Islamists, living today in family property close to one of the old UN posts. He fed us tea and coffee and walnuts from his orchard. His wife and six children now exist in this unfinished, cold house along with a small library of books – the speeches of Imam Ali (the “Najul Blagha”) and a collection of medical books of Aleppo herbal cures for headaches and kidney infection, published in Beirut. He says the people in his Nusra-occupied village are divided. Some are sympathetic towards the Islamists – they are not fighters – while others are sometimes permitted by Nusrah to cross the front lines for treatment in Syrian government hospitals. They are Bedouins and farmers, the unsettled and the landowners, always prey to the wolves of civil war insurgents. Colonel Saleh, who is 50 years old, has been guarding his echoing and weed-strewn apartment blocks on the edge of Baath City for three years, noting wearily that the Israelis attack his army but never attack Nusra who – being al-Qaeda – might logically have earned Israel’s enmity. But no. “I know every stone here,” the colonel says. “I can see if a rock or a vehicle has moved across the fields in front of us – and I can immediately see if one vehicle has become two vehicles. We know when they are going to attack – they always precede their offensives with a big artillery and mortar barrage.” Sometimes the voices of Nusra men shout insults at the Syrians on their own radio sets, calling them “kafirs” – ‘“infidels” or “unbelievers”. “If I am in a good mood, I invite them for coffee,” Colonel Saleh says. “If I’m in a bad mood, I am silent. Their accents are very similar to the Jordanians. They come from the south of Deraa, along the Jordanian border.” As we spoke, further down the line, the Syrians and Nusra were fighting with tanks, artillery and mortars. The Syrians claimed that their enemies arrived in several directions in a convoy of at least 13 vehicles. They spoke, too, of a Nusra female officer called Souad al-Qatahani (nicknamed “Al-Nood”), the 30-year-old sister of a Nusrah general called Qais al-Omani who commanded 1,200 fighters. She was, they pointed out rather remarkably, a former first lieutenant in their own Syrian government army. And one further feature that the Syrians have noted about their enemies outside Baath City. Whenever Nusra fire a missile, they have to take a photograph of the rocket leaving its launcher – presumably to prove to their suppliers that they have not sold the weapon to someone else. Trust, as usual in the Syrian war, is in short supply.",,1299,23.618181818181817,55,0.3202463433410316,0,0,0,0,94.63224458374573,28.705251903173394,74.3661128908093,6.249412888200271,0.74364896073903,0.0023094688221709007,0.025404157043879907,0.03387220939183987,0.036181678214010776,0.013856812933025405,0.15473441108545036,0.022324865280985373,0.0007698229407236335,0.006928406466512702,0.10161662817551963,0.0007698229407236335,0.049268668206312545,0.01770592763664357,0.001539645881447267,0.011547344110854504,0.008468052347959968,0.059276366435719784,0.0007698229407236335,0.03849114703618168,0.01308698999230177,0.057736720554272515,0.016936104695919937,0.006928406466512702,0.020015396458814474,0.004618937644341801,0.06235565819861432,0,0.0023094688221709007,0.003849114703618168,0.003079291762894534,0,0.003849114703618168,0.02617397998460354,0.001539645881447267,0.001539645881447267,0.4565050038491147,0.012317167051578136,0.011547344110854504,0.003079291762894534,0.006158583525789068,0.03387220939183987,0.001539645881447267,0.003849114703618168,0.010007698229407237,0.016166281755196306,0.005388760585065435,0.013856812933025405,0.003849114703618168,0.009237875288683603,0.005388760585065435,0.02617397998460354,0,0.0007698229407236335,0.01924557351809084,0.15242494226327943,0.02155504234026174,0.001539645881447267,0.024634334103156273,0.03926096997690531,0.037721324095458045,0.04849884526558892,0.008468052347959968,0.03926096997690531,0.14318706697459585,0.08237105465742879,0.016936104695919937,0.003079291762894534,0.025404157043879907,0.1562740569668976,0.008468052347959968,0.004618937644341801,0.003079291762894534,0.0023094688221709007,0.006928406466512702,0.0007698229407236335,0,0.011547344110854504,0.09083910700538876,0.11316397228637413,0,0.016936104695919937,0.024634334103156273,0.037721324095458045,0.08622016936104696,0.0800615858352579,0.003849114703618168,0.013856812933025405,0.0023094688221709007,15,0,142.55,0,0,13,1,12,1.83,36,8,9,15.125,9,15,0,42.955,16,178.54999999999998,237.505,42.955,,0.31142139263235424,0,0.8112511034166967,0,0,0.28159100187561975,0.029268651413606912,0.2656851201282929,0.05229132005931861,0.5204850789390615,0.1943339606452046,0.2134408548890932,0.31320375133413925,0.2134408548890932,0.33887326061703815,0,0.02921105334561936,0.010880615842856704,0.12142087242137903,0.1615125416098551,-0.8525463090790993,0.8384874583901449,66
35,"She skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance. The trick was to drop in for the start of third period, wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass. By the time her mother found out about the scheme, Skylynn Vazquez was failing every subject. Most days, Saquan Bright did not bother to show up at Boys and Girls High School in   Brooklyn. He chose to roam the streets with his friends. But then Ms. Vazquez and Mr. Bright found a school designed for students like them: Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service in Clinton Hill, which is operated by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Leadership, one of 57 transfer schools in New York City  —   established to help students struggling in traditional schools  —   has 202 students ages 16 to 21. By the time students reach Leadership, they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance. Many come from unstable homes, living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing, and have spent time in the criminal justice system. And 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family’s income. The flexible school schedule  —   which allows for free periods  —   enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate. And the school provides an optional paid internship program, which is appealing to students, some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves. Before Leadership, Mr. Bright could not keep up with the demands at Boys and Girls High School. He struggled to pay attention in class, and could not finish tests in time. Still, he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at Leadership. Now he receives services at Leadership and extended time for tests, and his grades have improved. At her previous school, in Bushwick, Ms. Vazquez purposefully broke the rules. She wore hats at school every day, even though they were forbidden, and each one was taken away. “There was a point where I didn’t have any of my hats,” she said. “All 30 of my hats were locked in the dean’s office. ” She enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year, after moving from Florida. She recalled skipping classes and darting off to play basketball and video games with a handful of friends, most of whom have since dropped out, she said. “We were a bad influence on each other,” she said. “If one of us wasn’t in the mood to go to class, we’d all leave. We pushed each other to do the wrong thing. ” In March 2014, Ms. Vazquez’s mother  —   enraged by the discovery of what her daughter had been doing  —   spoke with administrators at the school, who suggested that her daughter enroll at Leadership. Ms. Vasquez, nervous about again switching schools, did not want to go, but when she arrived, she immediately found a support system there. Classes were small, with 20 to 25 students, allowing a nurturing,   learning environment. Students are on a   basis with all the teachers, including the principal. “Respect can be calling someone by their last name, but sometimes when you call someone by their first name, you feel like maybe you’re on a different level,” Stacey Fischler, the school’s program director, said. Students have access to advocate counselors, who are similar to social workers and help them with issues beyond academics, sometimes referring them to mental health services or youth shelters. Each counselor, assigned to 40 to 50 students, is tasked  —   to the point of pestering  —   with making sure they all go to school. “My priority is to make sure you get your education,” said Heather Hansen, a counselor. “Whether that is going to your house and knocking down your door or calling you like a lunatic all day or bothering your parents. That’s my goal. ” Ms. Vazquez smiled as she scrolled through those daily morning texts. At 6:25 a. m. on Nov. 2: “Rise  Shine Scholars. The grind continues. ” Two days later, at 6:44 a. m.: “Rise  Shine #TGIF. ” “I don’t think they sleep,” Ms. Vazquez said, laughing. “It’s a very supportive school. ” More than 14, 000 students attended transfer schools in New York City as of the   school year, the latest for which the Department of Education provided data.   graduation rates for the schools are much lower than the overall rate for New York City public schools, which increased in recent years to 70. 5 percent in 2015. Although the class of 2015 at Leadership had a 5. 6 percent   graduation rate, that rate improves over additional years  —   typical of many transfer schools. About a quarter of students graduate within six years, according to Department of Education data. Despite lower rates, the schools are serving students who may have otherwise dropped out, never receiving a diploma. “You’re working with a population that can be changed, that does need help and doesn’t get targeted often,” Ms. Hansen said. “You’re working with a population that is getting a second chance. And it’s nice to be able to give that. At the end of the day, it can be frustrating and taxing, but you get to see them walk across the stage, and that’s the main goal. ” For Mr. Bright, graduation day seemed unlikely two years ago. In spring 2014, he fell behind again, started ditching classes and almost dropped out. That August, when he was standing on a street corner in   a car passed by. Shots rang out, hitting him in the abdomen. Members of his family and of the Leadership staff surrounded his hospital bed. “There’s a lot of love there,” he said. He returned to school with renewed commitment. The Leadership family also kept Ms. Vazquez in school. “I have good friends and a good support system when I get to school every morning,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d get this far. But now I see a difference in myself, in how I react and how I say and do things. I’ve become a totally different person, and a lot of it comes from this school. ” Both Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez are looking forward to graduation. Mr. Bright, who will turn 22 this month, is allowed to finish this school year before he ages out of the public school system. He needs to pass one more Regents exam, for algebra, his most dreaded subject. So Brooklyn Community Services has allocated $500 in Neediest Cases funds to provide him with    tutoring. More than   of Leadership students, including Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez, participate in an     program. They have paid internships at places including Burlington Coat Factory, child care centers and the Brooklyn Veterinary Group. Last semester, Ms. Vazquez, 20, received an internship at 3 Black Cats Café and Cakery in Brooklyn, where she worked in the kitchen. It was the first job, Ms. Vazquez said, that she took pride in. “To bake something from scratch and perfect it,” she said. “Knowing that it represents your work, that is new for me. ” The internship ended in November, but she hopes to work at another restaurant. Her love for cooking started in her grandmother’s kitchen. They followed traditional Puerto Rican recipes, including pasteles, a dish of plantains, meat and olives. Now she cooks to remember her grandmother, who died last spring. After graduation in March, she hopes to continue her passion and has applied to culinary schools in upstate New York.

36,"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said he is worried President Donald Trump is “using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard right agenda. ”  Schumer said, “Let me just say about his address, it was populist, but I’m worried he’s using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard right agenda. If you look at his cabinet appointments, so many of them are not populist but hard right. You know. Dr. Price, he wants to end Medicare as we know it. Mulvaney wants to cut even research into health care, DeVos wats to cut public education, Puzder goes against labor. So his cabinet is very troubling and that’s what I discussed. He said, ‘can you move my cabinet a long.’ I said, ‘look, with people who seem to be pretty mainstream, Mattis and Kelly we approved them quickly but so many of your cabinet appointees, Mr. president, are quite different than what you campaigned on and even what your speech was about.’ So I am really troubled at this populist rhetoric is covering up a hard right agenda which is way, way out of touch with what the American people want and even what Trump campaigned on. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",,212,19.272727272727273,11,0.2641509433962264,0,0,0,0,53.253369272237194,14.388793596340763,85.03945111492281,8.741450471698112,0.8207547169811321,0.0047169811320754715,0.04245283018867924,0.05660377358490566,0.04245283018867924,0.018867924528301886,0.2028301886792453,0,0.009433962264150943,0.02830188679245283,0.02830188679245283,0,0.07547169811320754,0.014150943396226415,0,0.009433962264150943,0,0.08962264150943396,0,0.07075471698113207,0.014150943396226415,0.06132075471698113,0,0,0.04245283018867924,0.018867924528301886,0.08962264150943396,0,0,0.02358490566037736,0,0,0.009433962264150943,0.02830188679245283,0,0,0.4716981132075472,0.014150943396226415,0.02830188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0.02830188679245283,0.05188679245283019,0.0047169811320754715,0,0.014150943396226415,0.0330188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0.03773584905660377,0.0047169811320754715,0.018867924528301886,0.0047169811320754715,0.02830188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0,0,0.24528301886792453,0.0047169811320754715,0.0047169811320754715,0.06132075471698113,0.05660377358490566,0.05660377358490566,0.10849056603773585,0.014150943396226415,0.06132075471698113,0.1320754716981132,0.16037735849056603,0.009433962264150943,0,0.03773584905660377,0.11320754716981132,0,0,0.009433962264150943,0,0.009433962264150943,0,0,0.0330188679245283,0.14150943396226415,0.08490566037735849,0,0.018867924528301886,0.009433962264150943,0.014150943396226415,0.1509433962264151,0.16037735849056603,0.009433962264150943,0.04245283018867924,0.02830188679245283,2,0,6.5,0,0,0,12,0,0,32,0,0,7,0,2,0,9,12,32,53,9,,0.11881849050177154,0,0.30470087388041417,0,0,0,0.4472205748723146,0,0,0.6832876826192507,0,0,0.3206244375399958,0,0.2473690465759769,0,0.035856573705179286,0.04780876494023904,0.12749003984063745,0.21115537848605578,-0.6868113721261697,0.7888446215139442,14

38,"The original   “Roots” was about history, and it was history itself. Airing on ABC in January 1977, this generational saga of slavery was a kind of answer song to the 1976 Bicentennial celebration of the (white, often  ) founding fathers. It reopened the books and wrote slaves and their descendants into the national narrative. But as an event, it was also a chapter in that story. It shaped and was shaped by the racial consciousness of its era. It was a   national reckoning for more than 100 million viewers. As a television drama, it was excellent. But as a television broadcast, it was epochal. The     remake of “Roots,” beginning Memorial Day on History, AE and Lifetime, is largely the same story, compressed in some places and expanded in others, with a lavish production and strong performances. It is every bit as worthy of attention and conversation. But it is also landing, inevitably, in a very different time. Viewers who watched “Roots” four decades ago have since lived with racial narratives of moving forward and stepping back. They’ve seen America’s first black president elected and a presidential candidate hesitate to disavow the Ku Klux Klan. So in timing and spirit, this is a Black Lives Matter “Roots,” optimistic in focusing on its characters’ strength, sober in recognizing that we may never stop needing reminders of whose lives matter. The first new episode, much of it shot in South Africa, looks stunning, another sign of the cultural times. Kunta Kinte (Malachi Kirby, in the role made famous by LeVar Burton) is now not a humble villager but the scion of an important clan, and his home  —   Juffure, in Gambia  —   a prosperous settlement. Kunta is captured by a rival family and sold into slavery to a Virginian (James Purefoy) by way of a harrowing Middle Passage. Mr. Kirby’s Kunta is a more regal and immediately defiant character than Mr. Burton’s. But his tragedy is the same: He rebels but fails and is beaten into accepting his slave name, Toby. The name  —   the loss of identity  —   is as much a weapon as the whip. As the overseer who beats him puts it: “You can’t buy a slave. You have to make a slave. ” Kunta stops running, but he preserves his traditions, including the practice of presenting a newborn baby to the night sky with the words, “Behold, the only thing that is greater than you. ” That theme of belonging to something larger, of the ancestral family as a character in itself, is essential to “Roots. ” Although Alex Haley fictionalized the events of his novel on which the   is based, his story offered black Americans what slavery was   to erase: places, dates, names, memories. And that focus keeps the ugliness  —   the racial slurs, the gruesome violence  —   from rendering this series without hope. A person may live and die in this system, but a people can survive it. Still, the individual stories remain heartbreaking, even in small moments, as when the slave musician Fiddler (a soulful Forest Whitaker) recognizes a Mandinka tune he overhears Kunta singing. He’s moved  —   and, it seems, a little frightened by what the recognition stirs in him. As much as he’s worked to efface his heritage as a survival strategy, it lingers, a few notes haunting the outskirts of his memory. Kunta’s daughter, Kizzy (E’myri Lee Crutchfield as a child, Anika Noni Rose as an adult) is teased with the possibility of a better life she grows up friends with the master’s daughter and learns to read. But she’s sold to Tom Lea (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) a struggling farmer who rapes and impregnates her. Rape  —   there are several assaults in this series  —   is another weapon against identity, another way you make a slave. Ms. Rose burns with Kizzy’s determination to hang on to her sense of self. Kizzy and Tom Lea’s son, Chicken George (  Page, walking nimbly in Ben Vereen’s footsteps) makes his name raising fighting cocks for his  . The series has lighter moments, especially with the charismatic George, but those can quickly turn dark at an owner’s whim. Childhood friends grow up promises get broken there are no good masters. At eight hours over four nights, each with a separate director, this “Roots” is about a third shorter than the original. It focuses less on white characters  —   gone is Ed Asner’s     captain, a sop to white viewers  —   though there are insights about how class resentment feeds bigotry. You feel the story’s compression most in the second half, especially the melodramatic, rushed final episode, which works in both the story of George’s son Tom (Sedale Threatt Jr.)  —   named, under duress, for his   grandfather  —   and George’s service in the Civil War. This   ends emotionally, but it emphasizes that there is no permanent   : “Every day,” the younger Tom says, “always going to be someone wants to take away your freedom. ” Overall, the remake, whose producers include Mr. Burton and Mark M. Wolper (whose father, David L. Wolper, produced the original “Roots”) ably polishes the story for a new audience that might find the old production dated and slow. What it can’t do, because nothing can now, is command that audience. As homogeneous as the     TV system could be, as many faces as it left out, “Roots” was an example of what it could do at its best. I watched it when I was 8 years old because it was all anyone was talking about, including the kids in my mostly white   school. A generation of viewers  —   whatever we looked like, wherever we came from, wherever we ended up  —   carried the memory of Kunta having his name beaten out of him. Viewers will have to seek out this “Roots,” like every program now. Today’s universe of channels and streaming outlets presents a much wider range of identity and experience. But we see it in smaller groups and take away different memories. That’s not the fault of “Roots,” of course it’s simply our media world. The legacy of representation now lives in a constellation of programs, among them dramas like “Underground,” which imagines its   story as an action thriller comedies like “ ” and “The Carmichael Show,” with their complex ideas of black identity and this “Roots,” still a necessary story, but now one story among many.",,1061,20.403846153846153,52,0.29783223374175305,0,0,0,0,89.00256068154278,21.230988153979773,74.23644766045422,21.430115872927868,0.8162111215834119,0.016965127238454288,0.060320452403393024,0.03298774740810556,0.03864278982092366,0.015080113100848256,0.2111215834118756,0.012252591894439209,0.003770028275212064,0.022620169651272386,0.09236569274269557,0,0.05560791705937795,0.011310084825636193,0.001885014137606032,0.022620169651272386,0.012252591894439209,0.10084825636192271,0.003770028275212064,0.07351555136663525,0.04241281809613572,0.06880301602262016,0,0.002827521206409048,0.027332704995287466,0.00471253534401508,0.07822808671065033,0,0.00942507068803016,0.001885014137606032,0.006597549481621112,0,0.006597549481621112,0.030160226201696512,0.001885014137606032,0.001885014137606032,0.46936852026390197,0.005655042412818096,0.005655042412818096,0.002827521206409048,0.002827521206409048,0.06597549481621112,0.000942507068803016,0.000942507068803016,0.020735155513666354,0.017907634307257305,0.015080113100848256,0.02639019792648445,0.002827521206409048,0.017907634307257305,0.008482563619227144,0.020735155513666354,0,0,0.013195098963242224,0.21960414703110273,0.01413760603204524,0.008482563619227144,0.029217719132893498,0.05466540999057493,0.04429783223374175,0.04052780395852969,0.017907634307257305,0.04241281809613572,0.1423185673892554,0.10650329877474081,0.02639019792648445,0,0.033930254476908575,0.13854853911404336,0.000942507068803016,0.006597549481621112,0.006597549481621112,0.003770028275212064,0.019792648444863337,0,0.003770028275212064,0.022620169651272386,0.09330819981149858,0.0706880301602262,0.000942507068803016,0.015080113100848256,0.003770028275212064,0.05466540999057493,0.1055607917059378,0.10273327049952875,0.005655042412818096,0.022620169651272386,0.005655042412818096,52,1,165.25,0,3,4.9,7,12.95,15,47.375,10,10,16,2,52,0,102,13.9,231.325,338.22499999999997,102,,0.6172177814626814,0.030076064478531474,0.8367129659775115,0,0.08510872257961455,0.1319011524391496,0.17834835212145247,0.28651056705065053,0.3174668280955988,0.5949836928508347,0.23669181907653403,0.23669181907653403,0.3316128774121265,0.05839581272817413,0.8083256063774971,0,0.07749434937035841,0.010560504473019431,0.17574882713821727,0.2569659442724458,-0.8501036477217185,0.7430340557275542,83

40,"J.K. Rowling is best known for her magical world of Harry Potter, filled with ghostly Dementors, tricky house-elves, butter beer, and spells that enchant or dispel an opponent. Her spellbound books do not stop there. Rowling has written other books, which are geared toward adults, such as her crime novel, “The Cuckoo Calling,” currently being filmed for BBC adaptation. Rowling also wrote “The Casual Vacancy,” a drama novel that has already made its debut on the BBC network.J.K. Rowling’s Bookcase of Magic Rowling went on to expand her extraordinary world of magic with “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” which is her next installment into a magical place young adults, children, and adults alike want to be in. The book was originally meant to be a textbook in the wizarding world of Hogwarts and centers around Newt Scamander.In the year 1926, he has completed a global excursion to find and document all of the world’s magical creatures. Unfortunately, after Scamander decides to make a brief stop in New York, he misplaces his magical case of fantastic beasts. (Yes, the world of magic has come to America.) He also meets a No-Maj named Jacob Kowalski, who discovers the world of magic after meeting Scamander and causes a bit of mischief.The immersive world of magic continues in Rowling’s “Quidditch Through the Ages.” Even though the book is not as magical as previous ones, it is still essential to the wizarding world. It is about Quidditch and was written by Kennilworthy Whisp, a renowned player of the sport. This book was read by Potter in the movie, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” Severus Snape caught him reading it outside the school, and makes a bogus rule that library books are no longer allowed outside the school, before he takes from Potter.A Collection of Wizarding Tales for Children Who can forget Rowling’s collection of the popular wizarding fairy tales for children called, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” This book is featured in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” Hermione Granger is bequeathed the book by Albus Dumbledore. It is a series of five stories:“The Warlock’s Hairy Heart,” is a story about a young warlock who has been jilted by love and vows to never fall in love again. In order to do this, he uses The Dark Arts, which saddens his family. Consequently, servants start to whisper about him not having a wife. He decides he will find the most beautiful and talented woman to gain the envy of everyone. Soon, he meets a girl and invites her to dinner. She is fascinated and repulsed by him. She wants to know if he has a heart. The warlock shows her the crystal casket that holds his beating hairy heart. She then asks him to put the heart back in his chest, and he does so. However, his heart had been out of his body too long and developed savage tastes. It causes him to forcefully take her human heart. Unfortunately, he cannot magically remove the hairy heart from his chest, so he cuts it out with a knife. Thus, he and his love die, as he stands with both hearts in his hands. “The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,” is about an old man that is generous. He uses his pot to brew magical potions and antidotes for people in need. After his death, he leaves his son the pot. Unfortunately, he does not have his fathers virtues. Bitter from only receiving a pot, his son closes the door in the faces of those who need help. However, he feels awful for turning away those in need. Eventually, he starts to help the townspeople. “The Fountain of Fair Fortune,” is about a fountain, which a person can bathe in once a year. Doing so, helps that person gain answers to their problems. This is where three witches meet. Asha, who suffers from an incurable decease; Altheda, who is poor and powerless because she was robbed; and Amata is beside herself after her lover leaves her. On their journey to the fountain, they are joined by a knight named Sir Luckless, and they continue the journey together. Along the way, they face three challenges. The first is a giant worm who demands proof of pain. The second, a steep slope where they must bring the fruit of their labors. The third involves crossing a river, which requires them to pay with the treasures of their pasts. Amata passes all three challenges by using magic to withdrawl memories of her lover and dropping them into the water. Asha collapses at the fountain. Altheda saves her by brewing an invigorating potion, which also cures Asha of her disease. Altheda realizes she can use her skills to make money. Amata learns that removing the memory of her lover has removed her regrets. Thier need for the fountain was no more. Sir Luckless bathes in the water. After doing so, he falls at Amata’s feet and asks her to marry him. The moral of the story is the fountain never actually had magical powers. To solve one’s troubles in life, one must do so for themselves. “Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,” is about a king who wants to keep all the magic for himself. In order to do so, he has to capture all the sorcerers in the kingdom. Then, he has to learn magic. He creates an army of witch hunters. Then calls for an instructor of magic. Unbeknownst to him, the instructor is a charlatan. The instructor is called to perform, with the king, in front of people. He is told if he cannot so this, he will be beheaded. The charlatan blackmails Babbitty, who is magical, into helping him. The charlatan is asked, by a brigade captain, to bring his dog back to life. Babbitty, however, is unable to fulfill the request and is exposed by the charlatan. “The Tale of the Three Brothers,” is about brothers traveling together. Upon their journey, they reach a treacherous river. To cross it, they make a magical bridge. Halfway across they meet Death, who is angry from the loss of the three potential victims. Death tricks them into believing he is impressed with them and grants them three wishes. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, known as the Elder Wand. The middle brother requests the ability to resurrect the dead and is given the Resurrection Stone. The youngest does not trust Death, so he asks Death to stop following him. With reluctance, Death hands him his Cloak of Invisibility. The brothers leave, in different directions. The oldest brags about the powerful wand he possesses and is murdered in his sleep. The middle brother brings back his lover, who died before they could marry. Regretably, she is not herself and is full of sadness. Inevitably, the brother kills himself to be with his beloved. The youngest brother can not be found by Death, due to the cloak he hides under. After many years of evading Death, he decides to take the cloak off and give it to his son. Pleased with all he has achieved, he willfully greets Death, and they leave together as equals. The Magical and Interactive World of Pottermore Rowling launched Pottermore, in April of 2012. In the immersive world, players can enter Hogwarts as though they are students, acceptance letter and all. Just like the books and movies, players are sorted into a house, before they can go any further. A series of questions are asked by the Sorting Hat. Then, players are placed into, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, or Raven Claw. Once a house has been selected, the player must go virtual shopping to obtain the items on the list, in the acceptance letter. First years must bring:A Uniform:Three sets of plain black robes. One pointed black hat, for day wear.One pair of protective gloves.One black winter cloak.All clothing must adorn name tags. Books:“The Standard Book of Spells,” grade 1, by Miranda Goshawk.“A History of Magic,” by Bathilda Bagshot.“Magical Theory,” by Adalbert Waffling.“A beginner’s Guide toTransfigurationn,” by Emeric Switch.“One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi,” by Phyllida Spore.“Magical Drafts and Potions,” by Aresnius Jigger.“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” by Newt Scamander.“The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection,” by Quentin Trimble. Other equipment:1 Wanda pewter, size 2, Cauldrona set of glass or crystal vials1 telescope1 set of brass scalesStudents can also bring an owl, cat or toad. After obtaining what is needed for classes, players were able to attend a potions class, duel with other students in the great hall, and interact in the common rooms. The journey also gives players exclusive information, not previously revealed by Rowling, that includes over 18,000 words of additional content.However, as of 2015, players on the website were shut out, so it could be overhauled. Unfortunately, most of the fun features were removed. Now, the site is for informational purposes and interaction with class peers. However, visitors are still sorted into houses and matched with a wand.The Magical Giving Side of J.K. Rowling Rowling dropped off the Forbes billionaire list in 2012, for two reasons; she donated an estimated $160 million to charity and Britain’s high tax rates. Moreover, Rowling’s reputation for bestowing her wealth is insurmountable and causes fans to wonder why she has given so much of her earnings to those in need. Her answer was simple and heartfelt:I think you have a moral responsibility when you’ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently.Rowling donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Children’s High-Level Group, now known as Lumos, after the spell of light from her Harry Potter series. She has also helped finance the building of a regenerative neurology clinic, in Scotland. These are a few charities Rowling has helped financially.Through her books, Rowling brought magical beings and creatures to the imaginations of children and adults, which in turn, allowed her to bring help to those in need through the proceeds.

41,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Definitive wins in New York on Tuesday send Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump into next week’s primary contests with the wind in their sails. Voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania will head to the polls on Tuesday. _____ 2. Shortly after casting a ballot for himself on Tuesday, Mr. Trump sat down with Times journalists for a lengthy interview, presenting a softer and seemingly humbler side. Regarding the past year, he said: “My life is winning. I win. I know how to win. Most people don’t know how to win. In golf, in sports, in life  —   I win, always. Better knock on wood. ” And then he did. He knocked on his desk. _____ 3. American money is getting a makeover. Harriet Tubman, an   who ferried thousands of slaves to freedom, will replace the slaveholding Andrew Jackson on the center of a new $20 note. And while a woman was also expected to front the $10 bill, the rap musical “Hamilton” seems to have protected Alexander Hamilton’s place on it. Women will be represented on the back instead, and on the back of the $5 bill. _____ 4. As many as 500 people may have died when a boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean last week, the United Nations refugee agency said after interviews with 41 survivors. That would constitute the worst humanitarian calamity in Europe’s migrant crisis since last April, when more than 800 people died off the coast of Libya. _____ 5. The first criminal charges over lead contamination in Flint’s water were filed against three government employees in Michigan. Two of them, state officials, are accused of misleading the federal Environmental Protection Agency about how the city was treating lead levels after switching its water supply to save money. Above is Michael Glasgow, the city’s utilities manager, who faces a mix of felony and misdemeanor charges. _____ 6. Five former police officers involved in the shooting deaths of two unarmed people after Hurricane Katrina pleaded guilty in federal court, ending a wrenching   saga that shocked and sickened people long before Ferguson and Baltimore became bywords in national debates on the use of force by the police. They each received significantly less prison time than they originally faced. _____ 7. President Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia barely a day after publicly supporting the release of documents that could implicate Saudi officials in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but administration officials said that wasn’t mentioned during his meeting with King Salman. The two leaders met amid deepening tensions over delicate issues like the Iran nuclear deal and the fight against terrorism. _____ 8. It’s been two years since the militant group Boko Haram abducted 276 Nigerian schoolgirls, and while U. S. officials say they have located clusters of the hostages, rescue operations have not been carried out. Fear of putting the captives at risk or inciting retaliation against hostages in other areas is holding up the efforts, but officials insist that plans to free the girls have not been abandoned. _____ 9. Surprise! College applications aren’t getting less stressful. With the admissions season just about wrapped up, many colleges are saying it was their most selective year yet. The heightened competition, or at least the perception of it, is driving students to apply to more institutions. But all the anxiety may be an overreaction: The average acceptance rate has remained stable. _____ 10. Happy Birthday to Queen Elizabeth II, who turns 90 years old on Thursday. In Britain, the bars (excuse us, pubs) will be open longer, and celebrations will extend beyond this week. But the Indian government wants something back from the British royal family: a 105.  diamond that some say was a gift and others say was stolen. Above, the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. _____ 11. The market for meteorites is tough right now. Several space rocks  —   including one that kind of looks like a piece of pizza, above  —   were up for auction on Wednesday, but many didn’t sell. Perhaps the prices were a bit out of this world. _____ 12. Lastly, go wash your hands. Differently. A recent study of two techniques  —   a simple,   method recommended by the C. D. C. versus a more complicated method recommended by the World Health Organization  —   found the more complicated one to be better. And both methods involved sanitizer, not soap. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.

42,"Email Print Option stuck on Clinton/Kaine Video footage posted on Twitter shows an African-American man attempting to vote for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania but the voting machine refusing to select any other option than Hillary Clinton. this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN — ædonis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016 “This is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut sh*t at first,” the man tweeted, adding that a poll worker helped him fix the problem. “LOL funny that the “errors” and “calibration” always favors the Statists. Things that make you go hmmmm….,” responded another Twitter user. The African-American voter said he complained that the polling station appeared to be using old machines. “I just thought about it, I didn’t have to show ID to vote either,” he subsequently tweeted. CBS News reports that Trump voters in Pennsylvania are seeing their votes switched to Hillary Clinton. “I went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,” Bobbie Lee Hawranko said.

43,"The Conservative Party manifesto, ‘Forward, Together’ unveiled Thursday represents a clear pitch to the   of British politics, with its emphasis on a strong government shepherding the country forward. [Peppered with sentences such as: “We know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals,” (page 9) the manifesto is sure to raise eyebrows amongst ardent Thatcherites.  But as well as being a clear and decisive departure from Lady Thatcher’s legacy, the manifesto is also a barometer of how the Tories intend to manage Brexit. Here, we run through the pledges most likely to worry Brexiteers. 1. That ECHR pledge, As home secretary, Theresa May made much of her opposition to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) having seen how it hampered her ability to extradite extremists. In April 2016, just months before the Brexit referendum, she even went so far as to say: “The ECHR can bind the hands of parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals  —   and does nothing to change the attitudes of governments like Russia’s when it comes to human rights. “So regardless of the EU referendum, my view is this: if we want to reform human rights laws in this country, it isn’t the EU we should leave but the ECHR and the jurisdiction of its court. ” That position has been entirely reversed in the manifesto, which promises not to bring the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law, but adds: “We will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway. ” And, of course, it adds: “We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights for the duration of the next parliament. ” (Page 37) 2. Immigration, The manifesto states the current annual net migration rate of 273, 000 “is still too high” and pledges to reduce immigration both from without the EU and within  —   “while still allowing us to attract the skilled workers our economy needs”. (page 55). In February, Brexit minister David Davis admitted, however, there was little Government appetite to reduce   immigration. “In the hospitality sector, hotels and restaurants, in the social care sector, working in agriculture, it will take time [to set limits]  —   it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs,” he said. 3. Picking winners, One of the major objections to the EU’s interference in the commerce is its tendency to pick winners, propping up fashionable yet unsustainable industries such as green energy. If British voters thought that would come to an end outside the EU, they will be sorely disappointed. “Our modern industrial strategy [  …    ] is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing back old companies from the dead. It is about identifying the industries that are of strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development,” the manifesto states. (page 19) In other words, it’s not about picking winners, it’s about  …     picking winners. “So we have launched a new £23 billion National Productivity Investment Fund. The government will target this spending at areas that are critical for productivity. ” (page 20) 4. Government funded research and development. One of the key cries from Remainers during the referendum was “what will we do without EU spending on research and development?” Well don’t worry  —   the Conservatives plan to step in and fill the breach. “We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical products and transform the world’s industries  —   such as the batteries that will power a new generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles. ” (page 19) “Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use. We want almost every car and van to be   by 2050  —   and will invest £600 million by 2020 to help achieve it. We will invest in more   buses, as well as supporting   displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural areas poorly served by public transport. ” (page 24) 5.   Speaking of electric vehicles, a central plank of EU ideology is environmentalism, particularly the sort that likes to tackle climate change through high taxes. Good news for Remainers  —   the Conservatives are fully signed up on that front too: “The United Kingdom will lead the world in environmental protection. As Conservatives, we are committed to leaving the environment in better condition than we inherited it. That is why we will continue to take a lead in global action against climate change, as the government demonstrated by ratifying the Paris Agreement. We were the first country to introduce a Climate Change Act, which Conservatives helped to frame, and we are halfway towards meeting our 2050 goal of reducing emissions by eighty per cent from 1990 levels. “We will champion greater conservation   within international bodies, protecting rare species, the polar regions and international waters. We will work with our Overseas Territory governments to create a Blue Belt of marine protection in their precious waters, establishing the largest marine sanctuaries anywhere in the world. ” (page 40) 6. Progressive politics in the workplace  …     In 2015, the Conservative Government under David Cameron fought off a Commission proposal to force FTSE companies to make 40 per cent of their boards female. But the Conservatives propose to carry forward the EU tradition of meddling in the workplace, adopting EU workers’ rights legislation wholesale, and setting quotas on pay. “We believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts but the public is rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders. “The next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders and listed companies will have to publish the ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay. Companies will have to explain their pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better. ” (page 18) 7.   …    and beyond. “We will push forward with our plan for tackling hate crime committed on the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity. ” (page 40)",,1025,20.918367346938776,49,0.37365853658536585,0,0,0,0,93.17037886472897,18.009887936717206,74.65853658536585,68.1411149825784,0.7863414634146342,0.03414634146341464,0.04975609756097561,0.03414634146341464,0.041951219512195125,0.03902439024390244,0.18439024390243902,0.002926829268292683,0.001951219512195122,0.010731707317073172,0.07707317073170732,0,0.06146341463414634,0.006829268292682927,0.002926829268292683,0.02829268292682927,0.012682926829268294,0.08780487804878048,0.005853658536585366,0.05951219512195122,0.026341463414634145,0.0575609756097561,0,0.000975609756097561,0.021463414634146343,0.00878048780487805,0.12,0,0,0.000975609756097561,0.004878048780487805,0,0.021463414634146343,0.011707317073170732,0,0,0.4448780487804878,0.000975609756097561,0.002926829268292683,0.000975609756097561,0.000975609756097561,0.03219512195121951,0.002926829268292683,0.001951219512195122,0.011707317073170732,0.006829268292682927,0.002926829268292683,0.000975609756097561,0.0224390243902439,0.02829268292682927,0.00975609756097561,0.00975609756097561,0,0.002926829268292683,0.03414634146341464,0.21073170731707316,0.013658536585365854,0.010731707317073172,0.011707317073170732,0.04975609756097561,0.09268292682926829,0.042926829268292686,0.03219512195121951,0.04878048780487805,0.16,0.07512195121951219,0.012682926829268294,0.000975609756097561,0.033170731707317075,0.13365853658536586,0.001951219512195122,0.0175609756097561,0.006829268292682927,0.002926829268292683,0.007804878048780488,0,0.000975609756097561,0.003902439024390244,0.06634146341463415,0.08097560975609756,0,0.011707317073170732,0.005853658536585366,0.033170731707317075,0.10048780487804879,0.11024390243902439,0.03219512195121951,0.07707317073170732,0,75,0,30.75,2,6,0,22.5,18,22.075,29.4,26.3,19,46,2,75,1,168.375,23.5,91.15,279.025,168.375,,0.7055174647201766,0,0.49552854631316046,0.060051130502043144,0.16083655731989654,0,0.4181771248811266,0.3650748937956509,0.4135447729564804,0.48430975042298025,0.45655797341549914,0.37769641682543464,0.5950459705018797,0.060051130502043144,0.4893568818738959,0.030955006828393312,0.13834966414001354,0.01930938148353567,0.0748957498818841,0.22926809227419317,0.7772168538820076,0.7707319077258068,87
44,"LONDON  —   The transportation minister of Belgium resigned on Friday, after the publication of leaked reports from the European Commission warning of security deficiencies at Brussels Airport, the site of two deadly terrorist bombings on March 22. The minister, Jacqueline Galant, is the   Belgian official to lose her job as a result of the attacks. The country’s interior and justice ministers offered their resignations shortly after the assaults, acknowledging lapses in intelligence sharing and law enforcement, but Prime Minister Charles Michel asked them to stay. On Friday, Mr. Michel said that King Philippe had accepted Ms. Galant’s resignation. He said she had “undertaken several bold reforms,” and thanked her for her service. Ms. Galant came under heavy criticism this week, with opposition lawmakers demanding that she go. The tipping point may have come Thursday, when Laurent Ledoux, president of the Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport, resigned, saying he could no longer work for her. On Thursday night, Mr. Ledoux, a civil servant, supplied documents to the state broadcaster, RTBF, which appeared to show that Ms. Galant had been notified of security problems at Brussels Airport, which was targeted along with the Maelbeek subway station, in assaults that left 32 people dead, along with three attackers. He openly accused Mr. Michel and Ms. Galant of misleading the public by not acknowledging that they knew about the reports. The documents Mr. Ledoux disclosed showed that in February, he asked for more employees and resources to tighten checks at Belgian airports. He requested a share of the 400 million euros, or about $450 million, that the Belgian government pledged after the terrorist attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13, which killed 130 people. Mr. Ledoux said Ms. Galant “systematically” disregarded his request. He also criticized the Belgocontrol, the air traffic control agency, whose staff members went on strike shortly after the airport reopened to protest plans to raise the age at which employees may retire with pensions. Ms. Galant, in tendering her resignation, described Mr. Ledoux as being disgruntled and having a political agenda. “For three years, he has waged a media campaign to cast discredit on my entire administration,” she said. “He is profiting by taking advantage of the worrying times to make accusations and confuse the facts. ” The dispute holds partisan dimensions. On Wednesday, two opposition parties released an internal European Union report from last April citing security deficiencies at the airport. That report, however, focused on security screening. The recent attacks took place in the departure hall, which was not covered in the report. Ms. Galant denied neglecting airport security. “In fact, if there was ever an area to which I always paid attention, it was this one,” she said Friday. Also on Friday, the British authorities announced the arrests of five people from Birmingham, England, on   charges.

45,"«La colección más completa de objetos de la actriz» ★★★ El Patronato de Preservación de la Imagen de Lydia Bosch ha abierto este museo en la misma casa que Lydia compartió con su primer novio, Chema, de 1983 a 1984. La exposición cuenta con el traje que Bosch llevaba cuando era azafata del “Un, dos, tres…” (así como un pañuelo con lágrimas de su primera bronca de Chicho Ibáñez Serrador), comida que robó de la cocina de “Médico de familia” y todo el papeleo de su divorcio de Miki Molina. Mi hija me comentó que el lavabo de chicas también era una metáfora de la carrera de Lydia, ya que fue incapaz de encontrar ningún tipo de papel. FRANCISCO MÉNDEZ «Barcelona no es sólo playa» ★★★★ Algo alejado del centro (una agradable caminata de 126 horas, o 124 a paso ligero), Madrid es un barrio que bien merece una visita aparte. Con la masificación turística, muchos ciudadanos han optado por mudarse a las afueras. Me sorprendió que no llegara el metro, quizá por ello Madrid sigue siendo uno de esos barrios por descubrir. Sus callejones estrechos, como La Castellana; sus jardincillos como El Retiro, o su propio Chinatown: Lavapiés. No olvide probar las joyas culinarias catalanas como el calçot circular (conocido como porras), el pantumaca (bocadillo de calamares) o los panellets (cemento armado con piñones por encima).

46,"Yevgeny Yevtushenko, an internationally acclaimed poet with the charisma of an actor and the instincts of a politician whose defiant verse inspired a generation of young Russians in their fight against Stalinism during the Cold War, died on Saturday in Tulsa, Okla. where he had been teaching for many years. He was 83. His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by a close friend, Mikhail Morgulis, with the TASS news agency. It said he had been admitted late Friday in “serious condition,” but the cause of death was not specified. His wife, Maria Novikova, and their two sons, Dmitry and Yevgeny, were reportedly with him when he died. Mr. Yevtushenko’s poems of protest, often declaimed with sweeping gestures to thousands of excited admirers in public squares, sports stadiums and lecture halls, captured the tangled emotions of Russia’s young  —   hope, fear, anger and euphoric anticipation  —   as the country struggled to free itself from repression during the tense, confused years after Joseph Stalin’s death in 1953. In 1961 alone Mr. Yevtushenko gave 250 poetry readings. He became, as one writer described him, “a graying lion of Russian letters” in his later years, teaching and lecturing at American universities, including the University of Tulsa, and basking in the admiration of succeeding generations before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But it was as a tall, athletic young Siberian with a spirit both hauntingly poetic and fiercely political that he established his name in   literature. He was the best known of a small group of rebel poets and writers who brought hope to a young generation with poetry that took on totalitarian leaders, ideological zealots and timid bureaucrats. Among the others were Andrei Voznesensky, Robert Rozhdestvensky and Bella Akhmadulina, Mr. Yevtushenko’s first wife. Mr. Yevtushenko did so working mostly within the system, however, taking care not to join the ranks of outright literary dissidents. By stopping short of the line between defiance and resistance, he enjoyed a measure of official approval that more daring dissidents came to resent. While they were subjected to exile or labor camps, Mr. Yevtushenko was given state awards, his books were regularly published, and he was allowed to travel abroad, becoming an international literary superstar. Some critics had doubts about his sincerity as a foe of tyranny. Some called him a sellout. A few enemies even suggested that he was merely posing as a protester to serve the security police or the Communist authorities. The exiled poet Joseph Brodsky once said of Mr. Yevtushenko, “He throws stones only in directions that are officially sanctioned and approved. ” Mr. Yevtushenko’s defenders bristled at such attacks, pointing out how much he did to oppose the Stalin legacy, his animus fueled by the knowledge that both of his grandfathers had perished in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s. He was expelled from his university in 1956 for joining the defense of a banned novel, Vladimir Dudintsev’s “Not by Bread Alone. ” He refused to join in the official campaign against Boris Pasternak, the author of “Doctor Zhivago” and the recipient of the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature. Mr. Yevtushenko denounced the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 interceded with the K. G. B. chief, Yuri V. Andropov, on behalf of another Nobel laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Mr. Yevtushenko wrote thousands of poems, including some shallow ones that he dashed off, he admitted, just to mark an occasion. Some critics questioned the literary quality of his work. Some writers resented his flamboyance, sartorial and otherwise, and his success. But his foes as well as his friends agreed that a select few of his poems have entered the annals of Russian literature as masterpieces of insight and conscience. Written and read to crowds at critical moments, Yevtushenko poems like “Stalin’s Heirs” caught the spirit of a nation at a crossroads. In Russia, writers could be more influential at times than politicians. But they could also be severely rebuffed if they offended, as Pasternak did with his novel “Doctor Zhivago,” and as Solzhenitsyn did with “The Gulag Archipelago” and other works.   lingered in the Kremlin after Stalin’s death. In one instance, nervous officials thwarted efforts to raise a monument at Babi Yar, a ravine near Kiev, Ukraine, where thousands of Jews were   and buried in a mass grave in 1941 by the invading Germans. The reason the Kremlin said it resisted a memorial was that the Germans had shot other people there, too, not only Jews. Mr. Yevtushenko tackled the issue in 1961 in blunt verse that stunned many Russians and earned him acclaim around the world. The poem “Babi Yar,” composed after a haunting visit to the ravine, included these lines: There are no monuments over Babi Yar. But the sheer cliff is like a rough tombstone. It horrifies me. Today, I am as oldAs the Jewish people. It seems to me now, That I, too, am a Jew. Alluding to the pogroms that erupted at intervals over the centuries, Mr. Yevtushenko went on: It seems to me, I am a boy in Byelostok. Blood is flowing, Spreading across the floors. The leaders of the tavern mob are ragingAnd they stink of vodka and onions. Kicked aside by a boot, I lie helpless. In vain I plead with the brutesAs voices roar:“Kill the Jews! Save Russia!” In a country ruled by Marxist myth, ostensibly free of bigotry, “Babi Yar” touched nerves in the leadership, and it was amended to meet official objections. Even so, it moved audiences. Whenever Mr. Yevtushenko recited the poem at public rallies, it was met with stunned silence and then thunderous ovations. He wrote once that he had received 20, 000 letters hailing “Babi Yar. ” Dmitri Shostakovich composed his Thirteenth Symphony on lines from that and other Yevtushenko poems. But Mr. Yevtushenko was not allowed to give a public reading of the poem in Ukraine until the 1980s. “Stalin’s Heirs,” published in 1962, also stirred Russians, appearing at a time when they feared that   repression might return to the country. It was published only after Nikita S. Khrushchev, the   party leader who was then involved in a power struggle with conservatives, intervened as he pushed his cultural “thaw. ” Stalin had been condemned anew the year before as having been a mad tyrant. The poem appeared in Pravda, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, and caused a sensation. “Stalin’s Heirs” opens with a description of Stalin’s body being borne in his coffin out of the Red Square mausoleum to a grave near the Kremlin wall. Sullenly clenchingHis embalmed fists, He peered through a crack, Just pretending to be dead. He wanted to remember all thoseWho carried him out. Mr. Yevtushenko went on: I turn to our government with a plea:To double, And triple the guard at the grave siteSo Stalin does not rise again, And with Stalin, the past. And later, the main point of the poem: We removedHimFrom the mausoleum. But how do we remove StalinFrom Stalin’s heirs? By the time democratic changes brought down Soviet Communist rule early in the 1990s, Mr. Yevtushenko had risen in the reform system to become a member of Parliament and secretary of the official Union of Soviet Writers. Along the way he received high honors, was published in the best periodicals and was sent abroad as an envoy of good will. He also endured abuse, jealousy, frustration and censorship. He once joked that Moscow censors were his best readers, the most expert at catching his meanings and nuances. Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Gangnus was born on July 18, 1933, in Zima Junction, a remote lumber station on the   Railway in the Irkutsk region of Siberia, near Lake Baikal. His father, Aleksandr Rudolfovich Gangnus, was a geologist, as was his mother, Zinaida Ermolaevna Evtushenko, who became a singer. His parents divorced, and the boy took his mother’s surname. Yevgeny spent his early childhood with his mother in Moscow. When German troops approached the city in late 1941, the family was evacuated to Zima and stayed there until 1944. Yevgeny’s father would sometimes take the boy on geology expeditions to wild regions of Kazakhstan and the Altai Mountains and, along the way, recite poetry to him. Yevgeny learned to love nature and literature. He was also drawn to sports. At 16 he was selected to join a professional soccer team. But sudden literary success compelled him to abandon that ambition. Soon his poems began appearing in newspapers, popular magazines and literary monthlies. The authorities praised his early poems, which he later called “hack work,” and he was admitted to the elite Gorky Literary Institute and to the Soviet Writers’ Union. But after Stalin’s death  —   Mr. Yevtushenko was almost crushed to death in a funeral stampede in Moscow  —   his work began to run counter to Soviet Realism, the officially sanctioned artistic style it reflected instead new thinking about individual responsibility and the state. Themes of state repression and fear had recurred in his poetry over the years, but he also began introducing personal matters into it, as he did in his long poem “Zima Junction,” about a return to his hometown in 1953. Published in 1956, it was followed by more volumes of poetry that refused to conform to the approved modes of expression. After he praised “Not by Bread Alone,” Dudintsev’s caustic 1956 novel about Soviet life, Mr. Yevtushenko was expelled from the Literary Institute. But as the 1950s grew to a close, he had published seven volumes of poetry and was allowed to read his work abroad. In the next few years he became familiar to literary circles in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Cuba, East Africa and Australia. Indeed, a virtual cult began to develop around him after Time magazine put his portrait, as an “angry young man,” on its cover in April 1962 and printed a laudatory article about him as a leading spirit in a changing, liberalizing Russia. For his part, Mr. Yevtushenko stressed that American writers had been important in his literary development. Later that year, he exchanged words with Khrushchev at a Moscow exhibit of contemporary art. Khrushchev, who had simple tastes and was facing serious political challenges, flew into a rage against abstractionism and made threats of coercion. A   crackdown on modern art, literature and music was felt soon after the confrontation. Mr. Yevtushenko kept a loyal following, writing about nearly everything of importance at home and abroad. He paid tribute to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after they were assassinated. He honored Allison Krause, one of the students shot to death at Kent State University during a Vietnam War protest. He chided John Steinbeck for not protesting the war in Vietnam. In the poem “Russian Tanks in Prague,” he criticized the   invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. (It was circulated only hand to hand, going unpublished until 1990.) In the   Mr. Yevtushenko championed the glasnost campaign of “openness” waged by the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. In a speech to the Writers’ Union, Mr. Yevtushenko assailed privilege, censorship and the distortion of history. He was a member of the first freely elected Supreme Soviet, the country’s standing Parliament. He went on to publicly defy the   conservative plotters of an attempt to seize power in 1991. The coup attempt, which temporarily deposed Mr. Gorbachev, sent a shock wave across Russia and around the world. Mr. Yevtushenko was later given a medal as a “Defender of Free Russia. ” The upheaval became the backdrop for “Don’t Die Before You’re Dead,” one of two novels he wrote. Mr. Yevtushenko did not write only about political and social issues. He composed verses on love, nature, art, travel and the various pains and joys of life. In 1956, for example, while married to Bella Akhmadulina, he wrote “My Beloved Will Come”: My beloved will comeAnd wrap me in her arms. She will notice the changesAnd understand my fears. Through the black downpour, from night’s gloom, Forgetting in haste to shut the taxi door, She will run up the decrepit stairwayFlushed with joy and longing. She will enter soaking wetWithout knocking. She will take my head in her hands, And her blue fur coat will slipHappily from the chair onto the floor. Mr. Yevtushenko had four marriages. He married Galina Semenova after he and Ms. Akhmadulina divorced. (Ms. Akhmadulina died in 2010.) His third wife, Jan Butler, was an English translator of his poetry. His widow, Ms. Novikova, whom he married in 1986, has taught Russian at a preparatory school near the University of Tulsa. Besides Alexander and Dmitry, he had three other sons, Yevgeny, Pyotr and Anton. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Yevtushenko kept homes in Russia and in the United States and, besides the University of Tulsa, taught at the the City University of New York and New York University (where one student remembered him dressed in silver suits “stalking back and forth across the front of the lecture hall” as he read his poems in “booming Russian”). He traveled widely, reading his poetry, lecturing, teaching and giving speeches to overflow crowds at universities. Through it all, Mr. Yevtushenko regarded himself as a patriot. In “Don’t Die Before You’re Dead,” he summed up his ambivalent feelings of triumph, nostalgia and remorse as a survivor of the defunct Soviet system. In a poem on the final page, “Goodbye, Our Red Flag,” he wrote: I didn’t take the czars’ Winter Palace. I didn’t storm Hitler’s Reichstag. I am not what you call a “Commie. ”But I caress the Red Flagand cry. Poetry made him famous, but Mr. Yevtushenko preferred in his later years to describe himself as a “poet, writer and filmmaker. ” Besides the two novels, he published dozens of volumes of poetry, which have been translated into dozens of languages. He acted or appeared as himself in several films, directed two others, wrote essays and compiled three volumes of his photographs. He preferred Oklahoma to New York. “In some provincial cities you can find the real soul of a country,” he told The New York Times in 2003. “I like the craziness of New York, but New York is really not America. It’s all humanity in one drop. Tulsa is very American. ” He called Tulsa “the bellybutton of world culture. ” There he enjoyed watching younger generations coming into their own. “Someone is near,” he said to one class in dramatic tones. “I feel it. Someone always has to be the leader of a generation. Someone has to be born. Why not one of you?” He had shown the same fervor a decade earlier, in July 1993, when the Concert Hall of the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow was the setting for a celebration of his 60th birthday and, by extension, a testimonial to the defiant poets and writers of the 1960s who had broken through the iron grip of Stalinism. “Today you, one of the initiators of the Sixties movement, turn 60,” President Boris N. Yeltsin wrote in a congratulatory letter to Mr. Yevtushenko. “Your innate, multifaceted talent arose brightly in the   years of the ‘thaw.’ The civic consciousness of young poets then played a huge role in the spiritual liberation and awakening of the people of Russia. ” A   woman agreed, telling a reporter: “He was a symbol for us then. Later he was attacked for not being exiled or sent to the camps, for making a career of protest. But not many of us had the courage to stand up to the regime, and he did. You can’t blame him that he survived. ” Mr. Yevtushenko, still the   in a brown silk suit, closed the evening by reading a poem called “Sixties Generation”: “We were a fad for some, some we offended with our fame. But we set you free, you envious insulters. Let them hiss, that we are without talent, Sold out and hypocrites, It makes no difference. We are legendary, Spat upon, but immortal!”",,2689,16.91194968553459,159,0.3406470806991447,0,0,0,0,94.97251589367617,8.967744747117887,80.99026899714887,20.168257510020243,0.7761249535143175,0.0167348456675344,0.04722945332837486,0.023056898475269618,0.051320193380438826,0.017850502045370024,0.19338043882484196,0.012272220156191893,0.005950167348456675,0.012272220156191893,0.09111193752324284,0.0007437709185570844,0.0476013387876534,0.008925251022685012,0.003718854592785422,0.007065823726292302,0.0026031982149497955,0.055410933432502786,0.003718854592785422,0.07251766455931573,0.023056898475269618,0.056154704351059875,0,0.011528449237634809,0.020825585719598364,0.004462625511342506,0.08478988471550762,0.0011156563778356265,0.007437709185570844,0.005206396429899591,0.006322052807735217,0,0.007809594644849386,0.060245444403123835,0.0014875418371141688,0.0014875418371141688,0.45295648940126443,0.0026031982149497955,0.004462625511342506,0.001859427296392711,0.007437709185570844,0.024172554853105245,0.0014875418371141688,0.001859427296392711,0.012644105615470434,0.008181480104127928,0.0167348456675344,0.060989215321680924,0.00334696913350688,0.01859427296392711,0.008553365563406471,0.02677575306805504,0.0007437709185570844,0.0003718854592785422,0.025660096690219413,0.19152101152844925,0.0014875418371141688,0.0011156563778356265,0.015619189289698772,0.07028635180364448,0.07288955001859428,0.06805503904797322,0.023056898475269618,0.05057642246188174,0.1569356638155448,0.09222759390107847,0.011528449237634809,0.0007437709185570844,0.030122722201561918,0.14168835998512458,0.004090740052063964,0.007809594644849386,0.0029750836742283376,0.004834510970621049,0.005206396429899591,0,0,0.04871699516548903,0.11640014875418371,0.07474897731498699,0,0.013015991074748977,0.003718854592785422,0.05057642246188174,0.09594644849386388,0.10189661584232057,0.004462625511342506,0.03718854592785422,0.003718854592785422,145.76,3,279.53,5,9,9,33,77.63624999999999,55.725,216.875,24,71,73.73,10,145.76,19,359.96500000000003,81,521.66625,934.6312500000001,359.96500000000003,,0.7210434161197904,0.05051228828712085,0.8321289628286423,0.08144451461091401,0.1376325906664668,0.1376325906664668,0.36916266271786813,0.5792550910859484,0.49702769535909086,0.793639209170014,0.29853906653904827,0.5573370773328541,0.5666243195153234,0.15062171662171017,0.7170046550131634,0.252017838123536,0.10594587037660429,0.023840138625991266,0.15353821872223478,0.2750831921504136,-0.8021848167542442,0.7249168078495865,226
47,"0 1949 The ACLU has got a few words for America’s newest elected “leader,” and the letter they just published through the NY Times, is probably the most amazing jab in the history of politics. It doesn’t hurt that the jab came from the American Civil Liberties Union, because the power behind the letter is what makes it so ominous to the president-elect. The letter begins with a request for Trump to “change course” on many of the claims he has made in his extremely short political career. “Dear President-Elect Trump, For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has stood as this nation’s premier defender of freedom and justice for all. As you assume the nation’s highest office, we must ask you now as president-elect to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. Specifically, you promised to: amass deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants ban the entry of Muslims and institute aggressive surveillance programs targeting them restrict a woman’s right to abortion services reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture change our nation’s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression” As if this statement alone wasn’t enough of a threat, the ACLU continues: “These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed. They are unlawful and unconstitutional, and would violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, as well as other statutes and international treaties.” “Many of our country’s most cherished rights are the result of ACLU litigation and advocacy. They include the Scopes trial (the right to teach evolution in public science classrooms) and the following Supreme Court cases: Korematsu (challenging Japanese American internment); Miranda (the right to remain silent); Griswold (the right to contraception); Loving (the right of interracial couples to marry); Gideon (the right to a court-appointed attorney if you can’t afford one); Windsor (striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act); and Obergefell (the right of same-sex couples to marry) and others. We have worked with and battled American presidents of both parties to ensure that our country makes good on it’s founding premise as the land of the free.” In the end of the open letter, the ACLU promises to make Trump’s life a nightmare if he continues to pave his road to concentration camp hell. They say Trump will have the full firepower of the ACLU to deal with if he doesn’t wise up. They letter concludes: “If you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of supporters stand ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights.” “One thing is certain: We will be vigilant every day of your tenure as president. And when you ultimately vacate the Oval Office, we will do likewise with your successor.” Today we published a full-page open letter in the New York Times to President-elect Trump pic.twitter.com/FOpRqn9oNY — ACLU National (@ACLU) November 11, 2016 Share this Article!",,540,31.764705882352942,17,0.3314814814814815,0,0,0,0,92.72881734853566,9.02531910441515,84.58377425044091,67.75396825396825,0.7925925925925926,0.011111111111111112,0.05185185185185185,0.020370370370370372,0.07037037037037037,0.03518518518518519,0.17962962962962964,0.012962962962962963,0.001851851851851852,0.022222222222222223,0.08703703703703704,0,0.04814814814814815,0.007407407407407408,0,0.022222222222222223,0.024074074074074074,0.09259259259259259,0.009259259259259259,0.037037037037037035,0.024074074074074074,0.06851851851851852,0.016666666666666666,0,0.024074074074074074,0.012962962962962963,0.10185185185185185,0.001851851851851852,0.005555555555555556,0.001851851851851852,0.001851851851851852,0,0.007407407407407408,0.012962962962962963,0.001851851851851852,0.001851851851851852,0.4388888888888889,0.003703703703703704,0.003703703703703704,0,0,0.027777777777777776,0.007407407407407408,0.001851851851851852,0.011111111111111112,0.003703703703703704,0.005555555555555556,0.009259259259259259,0.001851851851851852,0.014814814814814815,0.011111111111111112,0.024074074074074074,0.003703703703703704,0.001851851851851852,0.03148148148148148,0.1814814814814815,0.005555555555555556,0.016666666666666666,0.007407407407407408,0.03333333333333333,0.06296296296296296,0.05925925925925926,0.046296296296296294,0.044444444444444446,0.1425925925925926,0.08703703703703704,0.020370370370370372,0,0.025925925925925925,0.11666666666666667,0.003703703703703704,0.005555555555555556,0.009259259259259259,0.003703703703703704,0.001851851851851852,0.011111111111111112,0.003703703703703704,0.009259259259259259,0.1,0.07037037037037037,0.001851851851851852,0.020370370370370372,0.011111111111111112,0.03148148148148148,0.08518518518518518,0.07962962962962963,0.018518518518518517,0.05185185185185185,0.020370370370370372,16.4,0,28,3,7,0,14.175,7,3,41.8,19,5,38.805,0,16.4,0,87.205,14.175,68.8,169.18,87.205,,0.47073561654288715,0,0.602940338719816,0.13993131946754478,0.2751670872924413,0,0.4346281153866791,0.2751670872924413,0.13993131946754478,0.6939015970057095,0.507490982041442,0.21331887166009167,0.6778865859477851,0,0.17826035697019474,0,0.13051123948636592,0.021214343440390315,0.10296626657487502,0.25319524678978717,0.5853373739573328,0.7468047532102129,41
48,"CHICAGO  —   David Ross, the grandfatherly catcher, admits to never having paid much attention in history class. Kris Bryant, the precocious young slugger, isn’t much for math, struggling to count back the years since the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series. For a franchise so saddled by its own history  —   of bad baseball, bad breaks and billy goat curses  —   the latest iteration of the Cubs has carried on in a blissful cocoon of ignorance. “History doesn’t really weigh on this club,” Theo Epstein, the Cubs’ president for baseball operations, said before Game 6 on Saturday. “We’re just trying to win tonight’s game. These guys, a lot of them are in their early 20s, and they’re not burdened by that stuff. The organization isn’t. It’s just about trying to win and keeping it simple. ” In the end, doing simple better, to use one of Manager Joe Maddon’s pet phrases, carried the Cubs all the way to the World Series for the first time since 1945. The Cubs got there with a   victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers and their fearsome ace, Clayton Kershaw. The Cubs jumped on him early, added home runs from Willson Contreras and Anthony Rizzo, and protected the lead with artful pitching from Kyle Hendricks, who allowed just two hits over seven and a third innings. The Cubs’ opponent in the World Series will be another team with a history of hard luck: the Cleveland Indians, who have not won a championship since 1948. Their futility, of course, pales next to that of the Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 1908. But when the Series begins in Cleveland on Tuesday night, someone’s long wait will be near an end. “Magic number’s four  —   four games,” Rizzo said. “Cleveland, that city is deserving of the World Series, too. This is going to be a clash of two cities with a long drought and this is really good for baseball. It’s going to be amazing. ” When a    double play ended it  —   Russell to Baez to Rizzo echoing Tinkers to Evers to Chance  —   the Cubs poured out of the   dugout and mobbed each other on the infield as Wrigley Field shook to its   foundation. For close to an hour, most of the capacity crowd stayed in place, soaking in the scene and singing along with the team’s victory anthems  —   “Go Cubs Go” and “Sweet Home Chicago”  —   as the players celebrated on the field. “There’s a lot of pent up angst and emotion in this city and really all over this nation, Cubs fans that have been loyal over the years,” left fielder Ben Zobrist said. “We know that, but the bottom line is you have to execute at the right time and stay here in 2016. These guys have done it all year long with all the expectations on our backs. ” The Cubs rolled to the best   record in the major leagues, winning 103 games and clinching a division title with more than two weeks to play, but they have had to prove their mettle in the playoffs. In their division series, they rallied from three runs down in the ninth inning to finish off   San Francisco, which had won a record 10 consecutive elimination games. And in the National League Championship Series, after being shut out in    games, the Cubs bounced back from a     deficit. The pivot point for the turnaround was a fittingly simple play: Zobrist’s bunt, which was their first hit of Game 4. It started a   rally in the fourth inning, and the Cubs scored 23 runs in winning the final three games. “That’s the butterfly effect right there,” Maddon said. “It was a bunt this year. ” Although the Cubs were home on Saturday, with a loud, insistent Wrigley Field crowd urging them on, they knew it would not be easy to beat Kershaw, who had shut them out in Game 2 at Wrigley Field, allowing just two hits in seven innings. They would also have to beat back history. The last time the Cubs had been in this position  —   playing a Game 6 at home in 2003, needing one victory to capture the National League pennant  —   they had unraveled, blowing a   lead to the Florida Marlins after a fan named Steve Bartman interfered with a foul ball. On Saturday night, the seat down the   line that had been occupied by Bartman  —   Section 104, Row 8, Seat 113  —   was empty until just before game time. “I sat in it,” said Nancy Mazzone, whose seat was one row in front. “I felt   vibes. It’s all good. ” When a fan arrived to sit in the   Bartman seat, he identified himself as Bryan. He said he was 38 and worked for a   company, and he was wearing a No. 14 cap in deference to Ernie Banks, one of the great Cubs players who never made it to the World Series. Bryan was asked by one of a   reporters present if he knew the history of the seat he was now occupying. “I kind of do now,” he said. “We’re going to stay out of the way. ” The mix of anxiety and anticipation was hard to ignore as the crowd filtered into the old ballpark. The Cubs had been on the brink before, not just in 2003, but in 1984 when they needed one win over the San Diego Padres to reach the World Series, but lost three in a row. “I don’t want to have to say next year  —   not again,” said Kristine Fuller, 70, a retired nurse whose children chipped in to buy her a ticket to Saturday’s game. As it turned out, it was not the Cubs who were overcome by jitters, but the Dodgers. Left fielder Andrew Toles dropped a fly ball that led to a run in the first, and Josh Reddick was picked off first base in the second. The   Hendricks, who graduated from Dartmouth with an economics degree, has made a career out of a pinpoint but pedestrian fastball and operating in the shadows  —   all the way back to high school when it was his teammate, Tyler Matzek, who was chosen 11th overall in the draft. Hendricks had not lasted more than five and a third innings in four previous playoff starts, but he was masterly Saturday night. He allowed a single to Toles on the first pitch of the game, but on the second pitch, Hendricks, who induced more soft contact than any pitcher in baseball this season, got Corey Seager to ground into a double play. “Kyle pitched a perfect game,” Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. Hendricks did not allow another hit until Reddick singled with one out in the eighth. Maddon then strolled out to the mound to a chorus of boos and replaced Hendricks with closer Aroldis Chapman. The first batter Chapman faced  —     Howie Kendrick  —   hit a line drive that second baseman Javier Baez alertly fielded on a   instead of catching it on the fly, which allowed him to turn an easy double play and end the inning. “The outside forces felt different,” Hendricks said. “You felt the buzz around the stadium, definitely the energy. It was loud in there. At the end of the day, all I was trying to do was simplify and make good pitches. I was able to stay in that zone, kind of stay in my bubble. ” The Cubs showed no deference toward Kershaw, a   Cy Young Award winner. Dexter Fowler lofted a fly ball down the right side that bounced just inside the line and into the stands for a   double to start off the bottom of the first. Bryant followed with a   single to right, scoring Fowler with the only run the Cubs would need. After Toles dropped Rizzo’s fly ball, Zobrist hit a sacrifice fly to score Bryant, and the Cubs had what seemed like a gift: an early advantage that would limit any anxiety from the crowd. In the second, Fowler, a . 409 career hitter against Kershaw  —   the highest mark of any active player  —   hit a   single. That scored Addison Russell, who had rattled a double off the   wall, and gave the Cubs a   lead. Contreras hit a solo home run in the fourth, ripping a line drive down the line that he celebrated with a bat flip, although the ball barely cleared the wall. When Rizzo homered to   in the fifth, Kershaw sank to his knees and exclaimed, “No!” That made the score  . All that was left was for Hendricks to continue carving up the Dodgers and for Chapman to finish them off. The fans passed the time with a rousing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” and rose to their feet for the entire top of the ninth, bellowing, “Let’s go, Cubbies. ” By then, there was little anxiety  —   only anticipation, with some fans wiping away tears and others crossing their fingers until, finally, Yasiel Puig hit a slow bouncing ball with one out. When Rizzo took the throw from Baez, who had been fed by Russell, the celebration that was generations in the making commenced.

49,"Queen Elizabeth II made her first public appearance in almost a month on Sunday, allaying concerns about her health after she missed Christmas and New Year’s Day church services because of what Buckingham Palace described as a persistent cold. The queen, who will turn 91 in April, attended services at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England, with Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and his wife, as well as several members of the Duchess of Cambridge’s family, including her sister, Pippa, and brother, James. Before Sunday, the queen, whose appearances are usually a staple of the holiday season, had not been seen in public since Dec. 9. Her absence on Christmas Day was the first time in 30 years that she had not attended the holiday service.   on social media celebrated the queen’s reappearance. “The Queen has been seen in public,” one Twitter user said. “Huge relief. I can sleep easy in my bed now. ” The queen’s   came several weeks after a widespread Twitter hoax started by a fake BBC account that convinced many of her fans that she had died. Despite feeling under the weather, the queen managed to record her traditional Christmas broadcast. “The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows,” she said then. “I wish you all a very happy Christmas. ”",,237,15.8,15,0.31645569620253167,0,0,0,0,92.43875064734398,39.533863464243204,93.01004112588794,65.73527113611502,0.8607594936708861,0.0379746835443038,0.05907172995780591,0.029535864978902954,0.0379746835443038,0.06329113924050633,0.189873417721519,0,0,0.016877637130801686,0.08438818565400844,0,0.05063291139240506,0.012658227848101266,0.004219409282700422,0.012658227848101266,0.008438818565400843,0.06329113924050633,0,0.08016877637130802,0.03375527426160337,0.05063291139240506,0,0.004219409282700422,0.016877637130801686,0.004219409282700422,0.12236286919831224,0,0.016877637130801686,0.008438818565400843,0.08438818565400844,0,0.012658227848101266,0.08016877637130802,0,0,0.4472573839662447,0.004219409282700422,0.008438818565400843,0.008438818565400843,0.012658227848101266,0.03375527426160337,0.016877637130801686,0,0.012658227848101266,0.012658227848101266,0.02531645569620253,0.016877637130801686,0.004219409282700422,0.02109704641350211,0.008438818565400843,0.008438818565400843,0.008438818565400843,0.008438818565400843,0.02531645569620253,0.22784810126582278,0,0,0.03375527426160337,0.05907172995780591,0.08860759493670886,0.06751054852320675,0.029535864978902954,0.046413502109704644,0.14767932489451477,0.10126582278481013,0.016877637130801686,0,0.03375527426160337,0.20253164556962025,0.029535864978902954,0,0,0.004219409282700422,0.016877637130801686,0,0,0.046413502109704644,0.17721518987341772,0.05907172995780591,0,0.008438818565400843,0,0.12658227848101267,0.12658227848101267,0.11392405063291139,0.004219409282700422,0.02109704641350211,0.004219409282700422,3,0,9,0,1,0,4,8,0,12,20,20.375,14,2,3,0,55.375,4,26,82.375,55.375,,0.14763410387308012,0,0.34193868804200434,0,0.054583639049126324,0,0.1876127897984334,0.31594942629453465,0,0.4092698519760594,0.5358983848622454,0.5405153303435798,0.4469914717273348,0.10351694645735657,0.31594942629453465,0,0.18435289221806075,0.013316687473990845,0.08655846858094049,0.274240532667499,0.7057489625827535,0.725759467332501,19
50,"California’s   agency voted on Friday to push ahead with stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks, setting up a potential legal battle with the Trump administration over the state’s plan to reduce   gases. The vote, by the California Air Resources Board, is the boldest indication yet of California’s plan to stand up to President Trump’s agenda. Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump’s policies. Mr. Trump, backing industry over environmental concerns, said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed last week to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards. But California can write its own standards because of a longstanding waiver granted under the Clean Air Act, giving the state  —   the country’s biggest auto market  —   major sway over the auto industry. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D. C. follow California’s standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States. “All of the evidence  —   call it science, call it economics  —   shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,” said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis. The board’s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors. “What were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?” she asked. “Let’s take action today, and let’s move on. ” Long a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country’s effort to combat climate change. Officials said the regulations would reduce the country’s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year’s worth of America’s carbon emissions. Adopted in 2012, the standards would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54. 5 miles per gallon, forcing automakers to speed development of highly   vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars. Mr. Trump intends to lower that target. Friday’s unanimous vote by the   board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump’s plans. Now, the question is how  —   or whether  —   the Trump administration will handle California’s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California’s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue. California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California’s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge. The White House and the E. P. A. which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several states that follow California’s rules raced to its defense. “We’ve come a long way together,” said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. “We’re with you, and we believe in what you’re doing. ” Environmentalists and public health experts have criticized the automakers’ resistance to emissions rules under the Trump administration as an  . All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards. After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation’s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a “substantial challenge” for the auto industry. Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3. 5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a “staggering” $200 billion by 2025 to comply. A separate study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a think tank supporting emissions controls, has estimated that the cost of meeting those standards could be overstated by as much as 40 percent. And auto industry experts have warned that a slowdown in America’s shift toward efficient cars could leave its auto market a global laggard. John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules. “There is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,” Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny. What was required, he said, were standards that “balance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants. ” Automakers have also been critical of a California’s   vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program. Politicians in California, one of the country’s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump’s policies, promising to defend the state’s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad “sanctuary” policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation. In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr. the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House. Even at the federal level, the president’s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E. P. A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement   standards. Still, the Trump administration’s move to ease emissions rules is the first part of an expected assault on Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E. P. A. to dismantle   regulations on pollution from   power plants. The E. P. A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change. Bonnie   of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course. “The public is bearing a huge cost  —   billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,” Ms.   said. “I urge California to keep us on track. ”",,1203,16.04,75,0.36658354114713215,0,0,0,0,98.30765654141956,8.1694764824051,69.69207932549578,31.437537109606936,0.7273482959268496,0.0199501246882793,0.043225270157938485,0.0199501246882793,0.03158769742310889,0.011637572734829594,0.18204488778054864,0.005818786367414797,0,0.02743142144638404,0.09891936824605153,0,0.043225270157938485,0.006650041562759767,0.0008312551953449709,0.014131338320864505,0.0033250207813798837,0.06483790523690773,0,0.05486284289276808,0.02743142144638404,0.03657522859517872,0,0,0.015793848711554447,0.01828761429758936,0.10972568578553615,0,0,0.0024937655860349127,0.0024937655860349127,0,0.014962593516209476,0.024106400665004156,0,0,0.3940149625935162,0.004987531172069825,0.010806317539484621,0.0024937655860349127,0.0008312551953449709,0.03574397339983375,0.0008312551953449709,0.0008312551953449709,0.00997506234413965,0.00914380714879468,0,0.014131338320864505,0.013300083125519535,0.021612635078969242,0.0033250207813798837,0.014131338320864505,0,0.0008312551953449709,0.024106400665004156,0.18370739817123857,0.006650041562759767,0,0.019118869492934332,0.07231920199501247,0.08229426433915212,0.0199501246882793,0.017456359102244388,0.07315045719035744,0.14962593516209477,0.05569409808811305,0.025768911055694097,0.0008312551953449709,0.0199501246882793,0.12468827930174564,0.0008312551953449709,0.0016625103906899418,0.006650041562759767,0.0033250207813798837,0.004156275976724855,0,0,0.006650041562759767,0.06151288445552785,0.07481296758104738,0,0.00831255195344971,0.0024937655860349127,0.03158769742310889,0.0914380714879468,0.09060681629260182,0.004987531172069825,0.07231920199501247,0.004987531172069825,25.125,0,63.5,3,16,0,12.25,20.25,19,26.7,12,11,23.625,8,25.125,0,98.75,12.25,112.45,217.45,98.75,,0.3934706057126075,0,0.6211494027676139,0.0718910130021613,0.2923451249141372,0,0.2402910948917328,0.34333769377326856,0.32911925880545145,0.40807073145733164,0.23654719877941743,0.22119519077796654,0.3788800111922252,0.17119684379985609,0.3405424265831667,0,0.07334100783541907,0.009097998440343124,0.08351591221359872,0.16149875598796834,-0.33344587841411105,0.8385012440120316,74
51,"Carl Icahn was late, but he still had something to say. Wedging himself around a table crowded with Republican donors at a Hamptons beach house, he jumped in as Senator Mitch McConnell described how important it was to hold on to the Senate this fall. It was important to help Republicans hold the Senate, Mr. Icahn told the room. But they were kidding themselves if they thought they could leave Donald J. Trump twisting in the wind. “We have to get behind Trump,” Mr. Icahn said, according to two people who attended the event, held shortly after the Republican convention in Cleveland. “We all have to come together. ” In hotel suites and skyboxes, from K Street to the Texas suburbs, in conversations that are both urgent and strained, allies of Mr. Trump are imploring senior Republicans and senior party donors to come to Mr. Trump’s aid, despite a damaging series of   controversies that have left some in the party ready to abandon him. The goal is to persuade thousands of the party’s most reliable patrons to overcome their lingering objections to the candidate most of them never wanted, and to help defeat a Democrat most of them want even less. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump and campaign officials will attend a string of     organized with the Republican National Committee, hitting the summer haunts of the     —   from East Hampton to the California wine country  —   in a   effort to tap into the party’s vast financial reserves. On Monday in Detroit, Mr. Trump is scheduled to unveil a set of detailed economic policy prescriptions, a speech his supporters hope will help Mr. Trump reset his campaign and remind wavering Republican donors of the stark contrast that he offers to Hillary Clinton on issues like taxes and regulation. “It’s somewhat of a natural evolution with the donor base,” said Gaylord T. Hughey Jr. an energy lawyer who formerly backed Jeb Bush and is now helping lead Mr. Trump’s   in Texas. “I think the traditional donor base was somewhat shocked by Trump’s nomination. They’re learning more about him, but they’re also focused on what the alternative is, and what the implications of the alternative are. ” It is a dizzying turnaround for everyone involved, several donors said in interviews. Aides and   for Mr. Trump, a   billionaire who has spent months proclaiming his independence from the party’s traditional financial interests, now concede that they need mainline Republican donors to swing behind Mr. Trump so that he will have enough financial firepower to compete with Mrs. Clinton in the air and on the ground. While Mr. Trump’s campaign has rapidly ramped up     bringing in $64 million jointly with the Republican committee through digital and direct mail appeals in July, he is lagging behind Mrs. Clinton on larger checks, particularly the   and   donations that wealthy donors make to party organizations. And just as he asks for help, the party’s establishment donors are reeling from Mr. Trump’s decision to pick fights with the family of a deceased Iraq war veteran and the popular Republican House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Even so, many are grappling with the fact that he remains their only chance at keeping a Democrat out of the White House. But donors supportive of Mr. Trump said in interviews that they were encouraging their peers to consider the downside of a Clinton administration: a liberal Supreme Court and economic policies pushed to the left by Senator Bernie Sanders and the Democrats’ newly empowered progressive wing. “As he unfolds more details of his various policies, I believe the level of comfort will grow,” Wilbur L. Ross Jr. a New York investor and donor who held a   for Mr. Trump in July, said in an email. “More and more people are realizing that they shouldn’t be distracted by the sideshows that result from clever Democratic baiting of Trump,” he added. Some Trump backers argue that despite his criticisms of Washington, Mr. Trump is likely to lean heavily on conservative think tanks and   trade associations to stock his administration. Others are urging their fellow donors to face the hard truth that Mr. Trump thumped the donor class’s preferred candidates and earned the favor of Republican voters. Now, they say, it is time for the donors to respect the voters’ wishes. “In addition to fear of    policies under a President Hillary Clinton, there’s a certain earned respect for Trump among these people,” said Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Mr. Trump who is close to some of the party’s biggest donors. “The difference with some of these other successful people is respect for people who elevated him to the nomination. ” There are plenty of vocal and visible holdouts. Paul E. Singer, the prominent New York investor who raised more than $3 million for Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign, has conveyed to Republican officials that he would not donate a dollar more to the Republican National Committee as long as Mr. Trump was the party’s nominee. Other prominent donors spoke out last week after Mr. Trump’s belittling of the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in a car bombing in Iraq in 2004 while serving in the Army. Seth Klarman, a Boston financier who has given more than $4 million to Republican candidates and groups over the years, has decided to back Mrs. Clinton. So has Meg Whitman, the   executive who was a leading   for Mr. Romney’s campaign, and who said last week that Mr. Trump was a “dishonest demagogue. ” On Wednesday, Mr. Klarman said that Mr. Trump’s “words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president. ” Mr. Trump has also been abandoned by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers who oversee a network of conservative political and philanthropic groups. Many of their allied donors traveled to a luxury resort in Colorado Springs last weekend for the summer edition of the network’s biannual “seminars. ” Mr. Ryan, who clashed with Mr. Trump last week before finally getting his endorsement Friday for   was invited to speak at the event. Mr. Trump was not  —   though some Trump supporters pressed his case at private meetings and cocktail hours. Doug Deason, a Dallas investor whose family is active in the Koch’s political network, urged Charles Koch to reconsider, Mr. Deason recalled in an interview. Mr. Koch declined. “I brought up the fact that it would be nice for him to at least say that he would vote for him,” said Mr. Deason, whose conversation with Mr. Koch was first reported by The Hill. Mr. Koch has said that Mr. Trump’s policies do not align with his own, or those of the groups that he and his brother oversee, and that they cannot support him simply because he is the Republican nominee, according to James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group that runs the seminars. Mr. Deason said that other   donors he spoke to were supporting Mr. Trump financially on their own. So is William I. Koch, the estranged brother of Charles and David, who hosted Mr. Trump at his home in Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, on Saturday. And Mr. Trump is also having luck outside the ranks of megadonors, among the thousands of business owners and volunteer   who form the base of     in presidential campaigns. “It’s no different from raising money with either Mitt or John McCain,” said Brian D. Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who previously backed Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, but is now raising money for Mr. Trump. Two recent events, in Tampa, Fla. and Miami, raised more than $2 million for Mr. Trump and his party. “It’s about: What is government going to look like?” said Mr. Ballard. “A Clinton government? To most of the people I deal with, it’s horrifying. ”",,1332,21.83606557377049,61,0.3213213213213213,0,0,0,0,93.39434914118459,6.087999391796859,88.79261954261955,64.2042042042042,0.7567567567567568,0.009009009009009009,0.03978978978978979,0.024774774774774775,0.04054054054054054,0.02927927927927928,0.18093093093093093,0.003003003003003003,0.0015015015015015015,0.021021021021021023,0.07882882882882883,0.0007507507507507507,0.057057057057057055,0.0037537537537537537,0.0007507507507507507,0.006756756756756757,0.006006006006006006,0.06456456456456457,0.0015015015015015015,0.05105105105105105,0.026276276276276277,0.0472972972972973,0,0.0022522522522522522,0.02027027027027027,0.00975975975975976,0.11561561561561562,0,0.0045045045045045045,0.0015015015015015015,0.0022522522522522522,0,0.006006006006006006,0.03903903903903904,0.0015015015015015015,0.0015015015015015015,0.4369369369369369,0.0015015015015015015,0.016516516516516516,0.005255255255255256,0.0037537537537537537,0.048798798798798795,0.0007507507507507507,0.0015015015015015015,0.012012012012012012,0.016516516516516516,0.013513513513513514,0.05855855855855856,0.016516516516516516,0.015765765765765764,0.005255255255255256,0.00975975975975976,0.0007507507507507507,0,0.012762762762762763,0.1921921921921922,0.005255255255255256,0,0.021021021021021023,0.07807807807807808,0.06906906906906907,0.044294294294294295,0.03003003003003003,0.08033033033033032,0.15015015015015015,0.09309309309309309,0.02702702702702703,0.0015015015015015015,0.02252252252252252,0.11561561561561562,0,0.006006006006006006,0,0.0015015015015015015,0.003003003003003003,0,0,0.024774774774774775,0.1478978978978979,0.06231231231231231,0,0.014264264264264264,0.012762762762762763,0.038288288288288286,0.10435435435435435,0.1066066066066066,0.003003003003003003,0.044294294294294295,0,22,3,41.875,3,12.75,14,14.01,11,6,46.625,28.175,20.775,31.6,0,22,16.825000000000003,119.925,43.835,95.5,241.635,119.925,,0.3864496802299065,0.07909619750572906,0.54522255985851,0.07909619750572906,0.26741613997291663,0.28613181396879245,0.2862776844408074,0.2395027136711607,0.14659712023553698,0.5717106061500181,0.44648871643319626,0.37295682675751407,0.4749844166519707,0,0.3523183579392006,0.32509879568311933,0.07996945923508053,0.029230446075211636,0.0636821626595805,0.1611292081073061,0.4972194585001695,0.8388707918926939,74
52,"A Penn State Trustee has dropped his   bid and resigned his position after disparaging the Sandusky victims by calling them the “  victims” of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. [Trustee Al Lord bowed out of his   bid after being quoted in an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education. In the piece, Lord exclaimed that he is, “Running out of sympathy for 35 yr old,   victims with   net worth. Do not understand why they were so prominent in trial. As you learned, Graham Spanier never knew Sandusky abused anyone. ”  Lord, the former CEO of student loan company Sallie Mae, was commenting on Graham Spanier’s conviction on child endangerment charges. The former Penn State President was convicted on March 24 for his handling of a 2001 complaint against Sandusky, the school’s   defensive coordinator, PennLive. com reports. Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexual abuse charges and is now serving a   prison sentence. Despite the conviction and vindication of the many victims of abuse, Lord proclaimed himself “tired” of hearing about the victims. “I am tired of victims getting in the way of clearer thinking and a reasoned approach to who knew what and who did what,” Lord said in the interview with the Chronicle. Lord tried to walk back the comments by issuing a statement apologizing for “any pain the comment may have caused actual victims. ” But, during a recent forum sponsored by Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, Lord finally decided that his effectiveness to the school had essentially been destroyed by his comments, and he decided to drop his bid for  .

53,"Wednesday on MSNBC’s ”For the Record,” while discussing the statement from former FBI Director James Comey ahead of his congressional testimony scheduled for Thursday, House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan ( ) said it was “obviously” not appropriate for President Donald Trump to ask for loyalty from an FBI director.  When asked if he believes it is appropriate for the president to ask for loyalty from the FBI director, Ryan said “Yeah, No. Obviously, I don’t think that is. I think Director Comey will probably get a lot of questions about that tomorrow. ” He added, “Yes, FBI directors are supposed to be independent. That’s something that’s very, very critical. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN ",,116,14.5,8,0.29310344827586204,0,0,0,0,84.233755571194,11.497126436781608,60.216180371352785,41.3474801061008,0.8275862068965517,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0.04310344827586207,0.02586206896551724,0.02586206896551724,0.25,0.008620689655172414,0,0.034482758620689655,0.05172413793103448,0.017241379310344827,0.07758620689655173,0,0,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.1206896551724138,0,0.06896551724137931,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0,0,0.017241379310344827,0.008620689655172414,0.1206896551724138,0,0,0,0,0,0.02586206896551724,0.0603448275862069,0,0,0.4396551724137931,0,0.02586206896551724,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.0603448275862069,0.02586206896551724,0,0.04310344827586207,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0,0,0.22413793103448276,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0.0603448275862069,0.09482758620689655,0.04310344827586207,0.017241379310344827,0.06896551724137931,0.15517241379310345,0.10344827586206896,0.017241379310344827,0,0.06896551724137931,0.09482758620689655,0,0.017241379310344827,0,0,0,0,0,0.02586206896551724,0.08620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0,0.05172413793103448,0,0.06896551724137931,0.20689655172413793,0.1724137931034483,0,0.07758620689655173,0,0,0,7.921875,0,0,0,0,8.28125,1.83,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,10.83,0,10.921875,21.751875,10.83,,0,0,0.3850994375464757,0,0,0,0,0.39565730099782537,0.1263889782608136,0,0,0.1365270594958143,0.3562502205830146,0,0,0,0.08544252303960001,0,0.08616736438810077,0.17160988742770075,-0.010167497376379916,0.8283901125722992,11
54,"  14, 2016 How To Plan Farmer’s Calendar All Year Round A farmer’s work is never done. You’d think that in the winter when there are no crops to tend or hay to mow, there may be some time to take a break, and that’s somewhat true, but not really. Winter is actually one of the busiest times of year; in addition to taking care of the animals, clearing snow, and keeping things running, you need to plan and prep for the next year. Winter appears to be a time of sleep and relaxing by the fire, but for a homesteader, there is no such thing. If you have cows to milk and chickens to feed, then you still have to take care of that. Then there are all of the other tasks that you have to do: clearing the roof, bringing in firewood, making impromptu repairs. Winter is a great time of the year to make a plan for what you need to do in the spring, summer, and fall to make your homestead successful. We’ve put together a calendar of things to do in the winter to help make your homestead successful all year round. Check your Stockpile Winter is a great time to check your stockpile for several reasons, but the primary reason that we’re adding it to the calendar is so that you can decide what to plant in the spring. If you’re running out of green beans but still have a ton of corn, you can adjust your crops accordingly. Plant more beans and less corn. The same thing goes for canned meals and condiments. If you’ve just about eaten all of your beef stew and salsa but still have a ton of chicken soup left, adjust accordingly. You can also determine whether you’re best using your crops. Say you had a bumper crop of apples and made pie filling, applesauce, apple cider vinegar , and apple butter. Now you’re out of pie filling but still have 32 quarts of applesauce. It seems like you may want to adjust how you use your apples next year. Make a chart and record your findings so that you can compare to last year and make your adjustments. You don’t want to use your entire stockpile. It’s good to have enough for a couple of years, but you don’t want to can 6 months’ worth of apple butter and 5 years’ worth of okra, especially two years in a row. Concentrate on Your Herbs/Winter Crops I don’t know about you but I love herbs. They’re great for adding flavor, and for using medicinally. Since they’re easy to grow inside , you can grow them year round. Since you’re likely slam busy all summer and fall, wait until winter to harvest and store your herbs. This is a good time to make your essential oils and medicinal blends , too. If you live in a moderate climate, you may be able to grow some winter crops such as garlic, kale, carrots and potatoes during the winter. They’re easy to grow and won’t take up hardly any time. Search the internet for crops that will grow in the winter according to your zone . There are also early spring edibles that you can start growing and have ready to eat while you’re waiting on those peppers and tomatoes to grow. Start Your Seeds If you live in a zone where you have short summers and you want to grow crops that have a long growing period, start them inside as early as February. That way, you’ll have healthy seedlings or young plants to transplant when the weather warms up. Your garden will have a great start before the snow is even off the ground! Make a To-Do List for the Coming Months Plan your summer. Sit down and make charts of what you’re going to plant, how much of it you’re going to plant, and where you’re going to plant it. Keep in mind soil types and compatible plants when you’re making your chart. Think about your animals. Do you want to breed? Do you need more eggs? Did you put back enough meat this year? Are your chickens cramped and need a new coup? How about the barn – does it need repairs? Is the tractor running rough? Do you need any new equipment? Make a list by month of all these projects that you need to address. Plan Your Expenses Now that you’ve sat down and planned your crops and equipment repairs and made a list of other things that you do, then plan how much you’re going to need to spend versus when you’ll need it and when you’ll have the money to do it. Try to project any equipment replacements or repairs that you’ll need, too. Remember to allow for any unexpected expenses. You don’t have to stop with just the next year. Do a five-year plan, then adjust as needed. Keep adding a year every winter. This will really help keep you on track as long as you actually refer back to the list and follow it as much as possible. Make Syrup If you live in an area where you have birch or maple trees, late winter is when you can gather the sap from the trees and make your syrup for the year. Just FYI, it’s a bit of work to make, but it’s free and you can sell it for a great profit. That’s assuming your family doesn’t make you keep it! Do all of the in-house repairs. Think about those creaky stairs, unpainted rooms, loose carpets and wobbly stools that you’ve been meaning to fix all summer. Now’s a great time to get all of that stuff done so that you can check it off the list. Video first seen on TacticalIntelligence . Help Your Animals Adapt Winter affects different animals in different ways. Chickens will likely slow down production when the weather changes. You can head this off a bit by making sure that they’re snug and warm, but make sure that the coop stays well-ventilated. Keeping your hens happy will make your breakfast a happy event, too. Cows and horses, on the other hand, may need to be fed more so that they have enough energy to stay warm and (in the case of cows) keep producing quality milk. If you’re new to homesteading study up on your animals before winter so that you’ll know what to do to keep your animals safe and healthy. Winter is definitely a bit slower than the rest of the year, but there are plenty of things that you can do to maintain and improve your farm. Relaxing a bit isn’t a bad thing, either – you work your buns off the rest of the year, so give your brain and your body a break. Have Some Family Time Farms are a ton of work and though we all squeeze in “together” time while we work, cleaning out the chicken coop together just isn’t the same as picking up a Redbox or heading out for pizza and an evening of fun. There’s so much work to be done in the other months that it’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and forget to have some fun. Now’s your chance! Educate Yourself Winter is a great time to use your mind instead of your back. Farming, homesteading, sustainability, and prepping are ever-changing beasts, so take the downtime to catch up on the latest news and ideas that are available all over the net. Feel free to go old-school and buy some books and magazines to get some new ideas about how to move your farm forward. Think about planting guides, new equipment, new prepping ideas, or ways to help keep your animals healthy naturally. Another good subject to study up on is the plants that you’re growing. If you don’t know all about each plant that you grow, take this time to learn. Not all plants like the same types of soil. Some like rich, loamy soil, some like sandy soil. Some grow great next to each other and others, such as tomatoes and potatoes, shouldn’t be grown together. Just knowing these small facts will increase your yield and even improve the quality and flavor of your crops. If you have anything else to add to the winter calendar to-do list,   We can all learn from each other, but never forget the ways our forefathers made their own food, harvested their own plants and made their own medicines to survive during gloomy   1 total views, 1 views today",,1486,19.05128205128205,78,0.18842530282637954,0,0,0,0,61.60525342759529,41.978569210063156,87.91691158293735,79.68012561686855,0.8627187079407806,0.01547779273216689,0.05585464333781965,0.0531628532974428,0.03230148048452221,0.012113055181695828,0.14064602960969044,0,0,0.033647375504710635,0.06056527590847914,0,0.08950201884253028,0.024226110363391656,0.0033647375504710633,0.029609690444145357,0.01816958277254374,0.13055181695827725,0.0006729475100942127,0.04374158815612382,0.021534320323014805,0.08277254374158816,0.004710632570659489,0,0.03768506056527591,0.01816958277254374,0.058546433378196504,0.002018842530282638,0.0013458950201884253,0.008748317631224764,0,0,0.02220726783310902,0.01547779273216689,0,0,0.5074024226110363,0.004710632570659489,0.0006729475100942127,0.004710632570659489,0.0013458950201884253,0.04912516823687752,0.0013458950201884253,0.01547779273216689,0.016823687752355317,0.014131897711978465,0.009421265141318977,0,0.008748317631224764,0.028936742934051143,0.010767160161507403,0.0013458950201884253,0,0.0006729475100942127,0.007402422611036339,0.28936742934051146,0.002018842530282638,0.0006729475100942127,0.01816958277254374,0.046433378196500674,0.034320323014804845,0.08075370121130551,0.03095558546433378,0.013458950201884253,0.13728129205921938,0.12987886944818305,0.039030955585464336,0.004710632570659489,0.0013458950201884253,0.1601615074024226,0,0.018842530282637954,0.004037685060565276,0.0006729475100942127,0.007402422611036339,0.0006729475100942127,0,0,0.09152086137281291,0.04912516823687752,0,0.028936742934051143,0.004037685060565276,0.08681022880215343,0.18371467025572005,0.17362045760430686,0.004037685060565276,0.014804845222072678,0.07133243606998654,66.105,2.75,16.73,1,53,4.73,18,9,9,15.98,62.730000000000004,22.25,51.085,0,66.105,1.73,208.085,24.73,48.71,270.54499999999996,208.085,,0.6259834386592298,0.06509363315413551,0.29754475609195513,0.02469328756655741,0.5729925766517703,0.10694864251932346,0.313060708489267,0.18557911957158013,0.18557911957158013,0.2880481539529252,0.6136353512845218,0.360342354163368,0.5639651683103868,0,0.1684322744185187,0.041962958998154214,0.12486011478837955,0.014839083253077475,0.029228133653756722,0.1623388507361037,0.8508918249971369,0.8376611492638963,90

This time, the London-based Al-Hayat daily has claimed that the U.S. planned the attacks on the World Trade Center in order to create a global war on terror. Via AlternativeNews The article, written by Saudi legal expert Katib al-Shammari and translatedby MEMRI, claims that American threats to expose documents that prove Saudi involvement in the attacks are part of a long-standing U.S. policy that he calls “victory by means of archives.”Scroll Down For Video Below! Al-Shammari claims that the U.S. chooses to keep some cards close to its chest in order to use them at a later date.One example is choosing not to invade Iraq in the 1990s and keeping its leader, Saddam Hussein, alive to use as “a bargaining chip” against other Gulf States. Only once Shi’ism threatened to sweep the region did America act to get rid of Hussein “since they no longer saw him as an ace up their sleeve.”He claims that the 9/11 attacks were another such card, enabling the U.S. to blame whoever suited its needs at a particular time; first it blamed Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, then Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, and now Saudi Arabia.September 11 is one of winning cards in the American archives, because all the wise people in the world who are experts on American policy and who analyze the images and the videos [of 9/11] agree unanimously that what happened in the [Twin] Towers was a purely American action, planned and carried out within the U.S. Proof of this is the sequence of continuous explosions that dramatically ripped through both buildings. … Expert structural engineers demolished them with explosives, while the planes crashing [into them] only gave the green light for the detonation – they were not the reason for the collapse. But the U.S. still spreads blame in all directions.The intention of the attacks, writes al-Shammari in his conspiracy article, was to create “an obscure enemy – terrorism – which became what American presidents blamed for all their mistakes” and that would provide justification for any “dirty operation” in other countries.The terror label was applied to Muslims even though it was Muslims who helped America defeat the Soviets and bring an end to the Cold War, he writes. The problem, asserts al-Shammari, is that the U.S. must always find a new impetus to have an adversary, for “the nature of the U.S. is that it cannot exist without an enemy.”Al-Shammari’s article comes amid a torrent of vociferous articles in the Saudi press that range from accusing the U.S. of being “schizophrenic” and in cahoots with Iran to publishing warnings that if passed, the “Satanic” bill would “open the gates of hell.”",,498,27.666666666666668,18,0.3112449799196787,0,0,0,0,96.46904982567634,14.525130826335646,67.78026391279404,1,0.7751004016064257,0.02208835341365462,0.024096385542168676,0.01606425702811245,0.06224899598393574,0.002008032128514056,0.19678714859437751,0.0321285140562249,0.010040160642570281,0.008032128514056224,0.11244979919678715,0.002008032128514056,0.04417670682730924,0.008032128514056224,0.002008032128514056,0.024096385542168676,0.01606425702811245,0.09236947791164658,0,0.03614457831325301,0.010040160642570281,0.03614457831325301,0.018072289156626505,0.006024096385542169,0.02208835341365462,0.014056224899598393,0.08835341365461848,0.002008032128514056,0.002008032128514056,0.006024096385542169,0,0,0.002008032128514056,0.030120481927710843,0.002008032128514056,0.002008032128514056,0.463855421686747,0.006024096385542169,0,0.006024096385542169,0,0.0642570281124498,0.024096385542168676,0,0.020080321285140562,0.014056224899598393,0.012048192771084338,0.010040160642570281,0.008032128514056224,0.010040160642570281,0.010040160642570281,0.050200803212851405,0.020080321285140562,0,0.024096385542168676,0.1686746987951807,0.024096385542168676,0,0.018072289156626505,0.07028112449799197,0.06224899598393574,0.04417670682730924,0.012048192771084338,0.06626506024096386,0.1465863453815261,0.10843373493975904,0.01606425702811245,0,0.03614457831325301,0.1285140562248996,0.010040160642570281,0.006024096385542169,0.008032128514056224,0,0.012048192771084338,0.002008032128514056,0,0.010040160642570281,0.060240963855421686,0.0783132530120482,0.002008032128514056,0.008032128514056224,0.014056224899598393,0.03614457831325301,0.08433734939759036,0.09036144578313253,0,0.024096385542168676,0.020080321285140562,8,0,87,0,0,0,0,13,15,78.175,3,11.73,3,0,8,0,37.730000000000004,2,154.175,191.90500000000003,37.730000000000004,,0.29658556651379125,0,0.8209586712986691,0,0,0,0,0.4065845942048879,0.4415184401122529,0.8046945290157131,0.1365270594958143,0.38203907034735196,0.1365270594958143,0,0.24025307335204216,0,0.05832386517340259,0.003091644059019485,0.2383271113996646,0.2966509765730672,-0.8966867209775967,0.7033490234269328,43
56,"Comments Until this election, nobody knew that North Carolina was a state firmly committed to Jim Crow -style racism, but today it’s been literally difficult to even pass several hours without yet another illegal scam to suppress minority votes being revealed . A federal judge slammed North Carolina elections officials in court today in a case filed by the NAACP , where the US Attorney General weighed in to let the bench know that if proven, the allegations would show three major violations of the National Voter Registration Act. During oral arguments, the judge explicitly called North Carolina’s voter challenge law a Jim Crow law, like the ones which began apeparing in the 1890s and codified American apartheid in the South, leading to the civil rights laws of the 1960s. CBS reports : U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs said multiple times the challenge process sounds “insane.” The NAACP says counties are violating federal law by removing voters less than 90 days before the election. “This sounds like something that was put together in 1901,” she told lawyers for the state. The judge also said she was “horrified” by the number of removals in Cumberland County, which accounted for the majority of the statewide total. “It almost looks like a cattle call, the way people are being purged,” she told county attorney Rick Moorefield. Clearly, election boards and politicians in North Carolina are only restrained by the spectre of federal enforcement via the pre-clearance mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Unfortunately, since the moment that the Supreme Court decided to override the will of Congress and gut the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the impact of that willful act of judicial activism by conservative jurists has echoed in places where racism didn’t arrive with Trump, but festered secretly for decades, waiting for the opportunity to strike. The North Carolina officials who conducted the purge said they were following a bizarre state law, which the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has already indicated that it believes violates the National Voter Registration Act. Here’s how Republicans in North Carolina purged 6,700 voters from three counties, who are mostly Democrats: Under state law, any voter can challenge another county resident’s registration, resulting in a hearing where the challenger presents evidence, according to a state legal filing. If local officials find probable cause, the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing. A voter who doesn’t rebut the evidence can be removed. The NAACP lawsuit cites Cumberland, Moore and Beaufort counties, where activists have challenged thousands of voters. The challengers include volunteers with the Voter Integrity Project, which says it wants to guard against voter fraud. In most cases cited by the lawsuit, mail to a voter is returned as undeliverable, which county boards can accept as evidence the voter doesn’t live there. The DOJ filed Statement of Interest on the side of the NAACP, saying that if their allegations are proven true in court, there would be three separate provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. Apparently, the judge’s reaction means that they made the case: Three limitations on the removal of voters are pertinent here: (1) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a purported change of address outside of the jurisdiction using only mail returned as undeliverable and without following specific required procedures; (2) a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a change of address within the same jurisdiction; and (3) a jurisdiction may not carry out a program of systematic removals within 90 days of a Federal election. U.S. District Judge Biggs is expected to rule in the case early tomorrow, but it sounds like her opinion has already been made up after today’s hearing. North Carolina voters are facing unprecedented political roadblocks this year and it’s all due to their state Republican party’s all out war against letting people vote. It looks like the NC GOP is getting nervous that nobody will vote for bigotry laws that have damaged their state’s economy, so they’ve got to do everything they can to rig the election by preventing people from voting.",,696,30.26086956521739,23,0.35488505747126436,0,0,0,0,95.72838243950801,26.552107279693494,59.07540229885058,35.82801191996594,0.7456896551724138,0.014367816091954023,0.031609195402298854,0.031609195402298854,0.031609195402298854,0.004310344827586207,0.13218390804597702,0.007183908045977011,0.0014367816091954023,0.01867816091954023,0.10201149425287356,0,0.06465517241379311,0.004310344827586207,0.0014367816091954023,0.01867816091954023,0.015804597701149427,0.09770114942528736,0.005747126436781609,0.04741379310344827,0.020114942528735632,0.028735632183908046,0.0028735632183908046,0.0014367816091954023,0.022988505747126436,0.010057471264367816,0.06609195402298851,0,0,0,0.005747126436781609,0,0.011494252873563218,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0.4238505747126437,0.0014367816091954023,0.017241379310344827,0.004310344827586207,0,0.04885057471264368,0.0028735632183908046,0.0014367816091954023,0.021551724137931036,0.01867816091954023,0.0014367816091954023,0,0.0028735632183908046,0.022988505747126436,0.014367816091954023,0.01293103448275862,0.0028735632183908046,0,0.021551724137931036,0.21120689655172414,0,0.005747126436781609,0.022988505747126436,0.03735632183908046,0.05459770114942529,0.020114942528735632,0.01867816091954023,0.041666666666666664,0.13793103448275862,0.06896551724137931,0.015804597701149427,0,0.011494252873563218,0.14367816091954022,0,0.004310344827586207,0.005747126436781609,0,0.005747126436781609,0.0028735632183908046,0,0.005747126436781609,0.05603448275862069,0.08333333333333333,0,0.020114942528735632,0.010057471264367816,0.03735632183908046,0.11063218390804598,0.11925287356321838,0.0014367816091954023,0.04597701149425287,0.0028735632183908046,5,0,55,0,2,14,4,18,10.83,59,7,1,9,0,5,0,33.83,18,113.5,159.32999999999998,33.83,,0.18905299528192204,0,0.719446946423393,0,0.085296537673365,0.3949490464143221,0.1571856809867317,0.4563014015550728,0.3355266948884345,0.7333965492280352,0.24606636040557303,0.04454817121901355,0.29558969737663576,0,0.47621826326997774,0,0.04190355864392504,0.022295715506670137,0.14058687277817003,0.19735424175987515,-0.8400840321705555,0.8026457582401249,48
57,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter “If it does indeed turn out that there is relevant physical evidence, if this evidence is carefully collected and analyzed, and if this analysis leads to the identification of several facts concerning the UFO phenomenon, then will be the time for scientists to step back and ask, what are these facts trying to tell us? If those facts are strong enough to lead to a firm conclusion, then will be the time to confront the more bizarre questions. If, for instance, it turns out that all physical evidence is consistent with a mundane interpretation of the causes of UFO reports, there will be little reason to continue to speculate about the role of extraterrestrial beings. If, on the other hand, the analysis of physical evidence turns up very strong evidence that objects related with UFO reports were manufactured outside the solar system, then one must obviously consider very seriously that the phenomenon involves not only extraterrestrial vehicles but probably also extraterrestrial beings.” ( source )   The quote above comes from Peter Andrew Sturrock , a British Scientist, and an Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford University. Sturrock and a number of other notable scientists around the world came together during the 1990’s in order to examine the physical evidence that is commonly associated with the UFO phenomenon. One example used by Sturrock in his analysis, was a photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th, 1956, in McCleod, Alberta, Canada. ( “Physical Evidence Related To UFO Reports”– The Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects ) ( source ) ( source ) The pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft. One of the pilots described the phenomenon as a “bright light which was sharply defined as disk-shaped,” that looked like “a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal.” Another pilot managed to photograph the object, as you can see above. The sighting lasted for a couple of minutes, and this specific case was analyzed by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who estimated (from available data) that the luminosity of the object (the power output within the spectral range of the film) to be many megawatts. The Sturrock Panel also found it to be the case that a strong magnetic field surrounding the phenomenon or object was a common occurrence. Maccabee published his analysis in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (“Optical Power Output of an Unidentified High Altitude Light Source,” published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, vol. 13, #2, 1999). He also published one in 1994 titled “Strong Magnetic Field Detected Following a Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object,” in the same journal (8, #3, 347) Dr. Jacques Vallee, notable for co-developing the first computerized mapping of Mars for NASA, and for his work at SRI International on the network information center for ARPANET , a precursor to the modern Internet, also published a paper in the Journal of Scientific Exploration titled “Estimates of Optical Power Output in Six Cases Of Unexplained Ariel Objects With Defined Luminosity Characteristics.” ( source )( source )   This particular case is also referenced in this paper. One thing is for certain, it’s one of multiple strange phenomena that has and continues to interest a large portion of the scientific community. Here is a video of former Canadian Defence Minister Paul Hellyer speaking about the fields around these objects, and what some of them were doing to military planes. Let’s just be clear, these objects are commonly seen, tracked on air radar, and tracked on ground radar simultaneously. This is something that has happened hundreds, if not thousands of times. This is information that’s been made public over the past few years. For example, a declassified Defence Intelligence Agency document shows one (out of thousands) great example. It details how two F-4 interceptor pilots reported seeing an object visually, it was also tracked on their airborne radar. Both planes experienced critical instrumentation and electronics going offline at a distance of twenty-five miles from the object. Here is an excerpt from the report: “As the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all instrumentation and communications. When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. Another brightly lighted object came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the F4. ” (source) The report also described how a smaller object detached from the bigger object, turned inside the arc of the F-4 itself, and then rejoined the original object. This incident lasted for several hours. I decided to use this example because it has a number of declassified supporting national security documents, which goes to show how seriously this event was taken. “Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” Former head of the CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source, NY Times) It’s only now that more people are starting to become aware of this information. Here is a quote from Senator Barry Goldwater before the de-classification of all of these files: “This thing has gotten so highly-classified… it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I’ve never tried to make it to be my business since. I have been interested in this subject for a long time and I do know that whatever the Air Force has on the subject is going to remain highly classified.” – Senator Barry Goldwater , Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (source) Below is a great clip from author and researcher Richard Dolan , taken from The Citizens Hearing On Disclosure summing it all up in one short speech.

58,"Fashion designer Stefano Gabbana took to social media Tuesday to thank First Lady Melania Trump for wearing one of his Dolce  Gabbana jackets in her official White House portrait  —   and later pointedly told his critics to “go to hell. ”[In a post to his Instagram account, the    Italian designer proudly displayed the First Lady’s official portrait  —   released by the White House on Monday  —   which featured Trump wearing a DG blazer.  “BEAUTIFUL,” Gabbana captioned the photograph, adding the hashtag “#DGWoman. ”  #DGWoman BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤❤ #melaniatrump Thank you 🇺🇸❤❤❤ #madeinitaly🇹 A post shared by stefanogabbana (@stefanogabbana) on Apr 4, 2017 at 2:40am PDT,  It wasn’t long before the designer’s critics blasted him for taking pride in seeing his work being worn by the First Lady. “So you have lost a follower, and worst, an admirer,” one Instagram user, @_boyafraid_, wrote to the designer. “[I] dont care!! Really,” he replied. Gabbana also apparently wrote to one commenter to say, “vai a cagare,” or “go to hell” in Italian. This is not the first time the designer has taken on social media users over his show of support for the First Lady. In January, he excitedly shared a photograph of Melania Trump at the president’s New Year’s Eve party in Florida, during which she also wore a Dolce    black cocktail dress, from the company’s “Cruise” collection. “How many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram!” Gabbana wrote in response to his critics, before telling everyone who didn’t like his posts to unfollow him. Gabbana is one of several designers  —   along with Tommy Hilfiger and Diane von Furstenburg  —   who have said they would have no problem dressing the First Lady, after a number of other marquee names in the fashion world, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, have said they would not design clothing for her.

59,"OCTOBER 27, 2016 by Pamela Williams There is breaking news that a no-fly zone has been declared over the Dakota Access Pipeline area at Standing Rock, North Dakota. Protestors and Native American activists have set up a new camp called “Front-Line Camp” where they are making their last stand against the party Energy Transfer Partners, who are working on the Pipeline. The Sioux Tribe has declared eminent domain over the water rights and sacred land rights in the same area as the Pipeline is being built. They are asking for prayers as they make a great stand against the destruction of their sacred land. Pipeline opponents attempting to protect their water supply from the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), as well as prevent the continued destruction of burial grounds and cultural sites, are anticipating a confrontation with police today. This news come after “water protectors” refused law enforcement requests to vacate reoccupied land in the pipeline’s path, owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. http://thesccop.com/breaking-no-fly-zone-declared-as-militarized-police-prep-for-assault-on-front-line-camp-at-standing-rock/ While Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Chairman Harold Frazier sat down with President Barack Obama at a private roundtable in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 25, Morton County, N.D. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier was calling in police reinforcements from six states to enforce Energy Transfer Partners’ demands that “trespassers” be removed from the path of the pipeline. Authorities implied they may forcibly remove the water protectors from the new camp, which is on land recently purchased by Dakota Access LLC, the subsidiary that is building the pipeline. “We have the resources. We could go down there at any time,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said, according to the Associated Press . “We’re trying not to.” “We are here to enforce the law as needed,” Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said. “It’s private property.” Share: Rate:",,303,21.642857142857142,14,0.38283828382838286,0,0,0,0.0033003300330033004,96.3991368367606,24.352516501650168,80.44682801613494,50.4026402640264,0.7095709570957096,0.009900990099009901,0.0462046204620462,0.0165016501650165,0.033003300330033,0.036303630363036306,0.17491749174917492,0.009900990099009901,0,0.013201320132013201,0.08250825082508251,0,0.066006600660066,0.013201320132013201,0,0.013201320132013201,0,0.039603960396039604,0.006600660066006601,0.0462046204620462,0.026402640264026403,0.0297029702970297,0.009900990099009901,0.0033003300330033004,0.009900990099009901,0.006600660066006601,0.1254125412541254,0,0,0.0033003300330033004,0,0,0.006600660066006601,0.0231023102310231,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.3795379537953795,0,0.006600660066006601,0,0,0.0231023102310231,0.0033003300330033004,0.013201320132013201,0,0.009900990099009901,0.006600660066006601,0,0.0033003300330033004,0.026402640264026403,0.006600660066006601,0.009900990099009901,0,0.0033003300330033004,0.013201320132013201,0.18811881188118812,0,0.0033003300330033004,0.013201320132013201,0.04950495049504951,0.0627062706270627,0.036303630363036306,0.0231023102310231,0.056105610561056105,0.13861386138613863,0.0594059405940594,0.0033003300330033004,0,0.0462046204620462,0.16501650165016502,0.009900990099009901,0.013201320132013201,0.013201320132013201,0,0,0,0,0,0.0891089108910891,0.09570957095709572,0,0.009900990099009901,0.0231023102310231,0.0429042904290429,0.09900990099009901,0.11551155115511551,0.013201320132013201,0.039603960396039604,0,6,0,20,0,0,0,4,0,16.83,2,3,1,6,0,6,0,27.83,4,22,52.83,27.83,,0.26393116059052896,0,0.5444665782197481,0,0,0,0.19292728076790167,0,0.5014420476561822,0.10676232268609791,0.15202805015514587,0.05639139975154663,0.26393116059052896,0,0,0,0.08165361030425726,0.01173605609834815,0.06454830854091483,0.1550039609189332,0.3300842107188919,0.8449960390810668,15
60,"in: Big Pharma , FDA , GMOs , Government , Government Corruption , Medical & Health , Special Interests There was a time when “FDA Approved” was a vote of credibility. We could purchase a product and feel safe because the government watchdogs had checked it out thoroughly before allowing it to be sold. Now, “FDA Approved” means “The company that produced this product has enough money and clout to allow it to be sold.” Many people rely on the FDA as a source of knowledge and safety. Their recommendations mean something to folks who feel as though someone is watching out for them and that in America if something was bad, the government wouldn’t allow it to be sold. They believe that the drugs are tested and approved for our benefit and that the manufacturers of Big Pharma are at the mercy of the fierce protectors who are advocating for the people. Unfortunately, it couldn’t be further from the truth. This is all part of the giant marketing deception perpetrated on a trusting public. Some people are so snowed by what the FDA does that they want it to be even more powerful . There is actually an “alliance for a stronger FDA” whose mission reads like a diary entry from a hostage with Stockholm Syndrome. With responsibility for products that comprise more than 20% of all national consumer spending, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) oversees aspects of several industries that are key to our nation’s growth and prosperity. A science-based, predictable, and efficient FDA helps these industries — including the food, drug, medical device, and cosmetics industries — to innovate and to create high-paying jobs here in America while improving our balance of trade. The Alliance for a Stronger FDA works to ensure annual appropriations that will adequately fund the FDA’s essential missions, and we believe that the American people expect this too. There is no backstop, no other agency, that performs this critical work. The federal g overnment gives the FDA about $8 per year for each American (an “appropriation” of $2.561 billion for FY 2014). Nowhere else in the federal budget does so little money need to go so far. The FDA has just 10,000 employees to monitor food safety, review the safety and efficacy of medical products, assure the safe use of those medical products, and protect the American people, their pets, and their farm animals from poorly made, counterfeit, and illegal food, drugs, and cosmetics. Recent research on a variety of topics has led me to note some astonishing facts about the GMO Food and Drug Pushers Administration. Like a bad penny, it seems whatever topic I’m looking into, the FDA keeps turning up. The FDA has a central role in the increasing tyranny in the United States and we, as taxpayers, are funding them to do this. Be warned, you aren’t going to like what you read below, but unless you are mired in intractable cognitive dissonance, you’re going to see a pattern of abuse and deception. The FDA’s Perpetual Conflicts of Interest First of all, it would be nice to believe that the group who decides whether foods and medicines are safe for our consumption is unbiased and benevolent. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Let’s take a look at the leadership – the head of the snake – and the ties of those leaders to Big Agri and Big Pharma. Some previous tsars/commissioners are: 2016: Dr. Robert Califf Califf is a cardiologist who was a tenured professor at Duke University School of Medicine. He’s long been criticized for having deep financial ties to Big Pharma. He worked closely with drug companies and convinced them to do large, expensive clinical trials that were very profitable for Duke. Califf was a paid consultant for Merck Sharp & Dohme, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly per ProPublica from 2009 to 2013. In the disclosure information for an article published in the journal Circulation in 2013, Califf shared that he was a consultant for Gilead – the drug company that recently came under scrutiny for outrageously priced hepatitis C drugs. The price for a 12-week course of treatment with one of the drugs was initially set at $84,000 . 2010: Michael Taylor Taylor’s most recent resume entry: VP and attorney for Satan Monsanto. One of Taylor’s “accomplishments” for Monsanto was writing the rules that allowed recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone into the American food and milk supply, and forcing dairies who labelled their milk as rBGH-free to also state that there was “no difference between their hormone free milk and the chemically enhanced milk.” 2009: Margaret Hamburg Hamburg served on the board of directors of Henry Schien, Inc. previous to her appointment to the throne of the FDA. Henry Schien, Inc. produces amalgam dental products – products that contain toxic mercury. Hamburg spearheaded the legislation that allowed mercury to be allowed in dental products (without a required warning for the consumers) during her time at the FDA. Hamburg was recently named as one of the defendants in an $800 million RICO lawsuit . The suit accuses Hamburg of playing a role in a conspiracy to approve Levaquin, an antibiotic drug known to cause severe (and even deadly) side effects, in order to financially benefit her husband’s hedge fund which held very large financial positions in Johnson & Johnson, makers of the drug. 2006: Andrew von Eschenbach A Bush family friend, von Eshchenbach has a background as a drug peddler for Big Pharma and as the head of the National Cancer Society. Some highlights of his reign over the FDA were the speedy approval of Avandia, a medication for diabetes that had the unfortunate side effect of a 43% increase in heart attacks among those taking it; and accusations of corruption and intimidation by the FDA’s own scientists. **** But if that cast of characters isn’t enough to shed doubt on the veracity of any claim made by this organization, take a look at the following facts and tell me that they’re looking out for people instead of corporate interests. The FDA seems to be busily striving to regulate the family farm right out of business. The FDA has gone “SWAT Team” on producers of raw milk and cheese, performing armed raids on small farms , seizing and destroying inventory and handcuffing farmers to haul them off to jail. The FDA keeps adding “food safety” requirements to small organic farms while doing nothing about the factory farms’ abundant use of pesticides and toxins. The FDA pushed the Food Safety Modernization Act which could eventually shut down farmer’s markets across the country – or at least make the food more difficult and expensive for farmers to produce. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC), “The regulations could erect new barriers to these important markets for small and mid-scale farmers unable to bear the expense of compliance.” Find the regulations here. With all of these new (time-consuming and pricey) legislations that farmers must adhere to , the price of local organic produce is skyrocketing, making the product unaffordable for most Americans. This, in turn, reduces competition for the huge factory farms and their GMO-tainted, chemical-sprayed products, allowing a huge profit at the end of the day for Big Agri. The FDA crackdown on health food stores and promoters of natural remedies is reminiscent of cops raiding a meth lab full of junkies. Since 1987, facilities such as the Life Extension Foundation, vitamin manufacturers, health food stores, natural pet food stores and naturopathic medical clinics have been raided by agents waving assault rifles. Owners and employees have been arrested and convicted of crimes. Countless merchandise and literature has been confiscated. What was the crime committed by these natural healing companies? They don’t tithe to the Church of Big Pharma. The FDA is busily “harmonizing” the United States policies with Codex Alimentarius . Codex is the United Nations’ sinister plot to be in control of the food consumption of the world, as per Agenda 21 . Codex promotes chemical agriculture, heavily medicated livestock and genetically modified produce. It’s all done under a do-gooder disguise – the CA Commission states its goals as “protecting the health of consumers, ensuring fair trade practices and promoting coordination of food standards.” Codex actually outlaws the sale of vitamins of beneficial dosages, as well as natural remedies. According to Mike Adams , the founder of Natural News, “the FDA will “harmonize” the U.S. food and dietary supplement industries with global Codex requirements which make illegal virtually all healthy doses of vitamins and minerals. Under full Codex “harmonization,” America will be left with a dead food supply and the health food stores will be virtually stripped bare of dietary supplements. Selling vitamin D at a reasonable dose such as 4,000 IU per capsule will be criminalized and products will be seized and destroyed by FDA agents who recruit local law enforcement to bring in the firepower.",,1497,24.540983606557376,61,0.35070140280561124,0,0,0,0,95.17386074935135,4.935289866945633,64.10079418095451,53.392117568470276,0.7828991315965264,0.014696058784235137,0.050100200400801605,0.020708082832331328,0.04542418169672679,0.012692050768203072,0.16098864395457582,0.007348029392117568,0.0006680026720106881,0.014028056112224449,0.09018036072144289,0,0.0614562458249833,0.050100200400801605,0.002004008016032064,0.029392117568470273,0.01002004008016032,0.07748830995323981,0.004676018704074816,0.049432197728790914,0.02137608550434202,0.055444221776887105,0.006012024048096192,0.0006680026720106881,0.012692050768203072,0.008016032064128256,0.09352037408149633,0,0.0026720106880427524,0.002004008016032064,0.002004008016032064,0,0.007348029392117568,0.025384101536406144,0.0006680026720106881,0.0006680026720106881,0.4301937207748831,0.03206412825651302,0.002004008016032064,0.0026720106880427524,0.002004008016032064,0.04408817635270541,0.002004008016032064,0.01736806947227789,0.012692050768203072,0.01068804275217101,0.0033400133600534404,0.004676018704074816,0.029392117568470273,0.01068804275217101,0.008016032064128256,0.015364061456245824,0.0013360053440213762,0.0006680026720106881,0.016700066800267203,0.1957247828991316,0.01603206412825651,0.004008016032064128,0.008684034736138945,0.04609218436873747,0.09686038744154976,0.024716098864395457,0.03006012024048096,0.050100200400801605,0.14762859051436206,0.06880427521710086,0.01603206412825651,0.0006680026720106881,0.019372077488309953,0.09619238476953908,0.002004008016032064,0.008684034736138945,0.013360053440213761,0,0.004676018704074816,0.0006680026720106881,0,0.004676018704074816,0.049432197728790914,0.06613226452905811,0,0.012024048096192385,0.008684034736138945,0.018704074816299265,0.09418837675350701,0.10754843019372078,0.005344021376085505,0.07080828323313293,0.004008016032064128,73.875,0,112.80000000000001,12,48,22.875,17.3,51,2.83,78,9,20.75,45,0,73.875,0,186.115,44.175,210.3,433.71500000000003,186.115,,0.6789763297229947,0,0.7635628956290366,0.2557081605183565,0.5788118792702895,0.39573729334542146,0.3312367870463286,0.593516713938853,0.07495001444532315,0.6907025339914916,0.20487838941028416,0.3726752803835373,0.563003195414201,0,0.4578719159336837,0,0.10341359604159547,0.02454555304589893,0.11685183487385502,0.2409909346757681,-0.49475097476562113,0.7590090653242318,131
61,"Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/01/2016 - 19:14 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong Syria is “the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history.” The author regrets that left analyst Eric Draitser has contributed to the confusion. Draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the Syrian government. Danny Haiphong counters that “the left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder.” Break the Silence or Support Self-Determination? In Syria, the Answer Should be Obvious by Danny Haiphong “To claim that the left in the US should fight for ‘peace’ and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war.” Imperialism's war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression. Syria is currently the battleground of imperialism's last gasp of life. In nearly six years, Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialism's forces of reaction. It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history. The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria. Nowhere is this confusion greater than in the United States, and it appears someone I deeply respect has been overtaken by it. In a recent issue of CounterPunch, Eric Draitser dives head deep into the confusion . He criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the left's stance. Draitser first criticizes the pro-imperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreign-sponsored terror groups in Syria, which have been labeled ""revolutionaries"" or ""rebels"" by the imperialist countries. He then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the Syrian government. It is his criticism of the ""pro-Assad left"" that needs further examination. Draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks: ""Will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of Syrians at heart?"" Draitser's question assumes that the Syrian and Russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in Syria. Their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the Syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists. If this is not the case, he doesn't state otherwise in the piece. In fact, Draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources. “The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria.” First, Draitser claims that the war on Syria began as a genuine protest against ""neo-liberal"" reforms instituted by the Syrian government. This narrative is popular among the liberal-left media as well as the white left generally. However, those who make this claim rarely specify what neo-liberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent. Stephen Gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media that describe the uprising in March of 2011 as immediately violent, ill-supported, and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the Syrian government that were broadly supported by the Syrian people. At the same time as the violent uprisings, thousands of Syrians were protesting in the streets in support of President Assad. Furthermore, reports from the city of Daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed ""rebels"" who had freshly arrived from their US-NATO backed destruction of Libya . These ""rebels"" have since infested the country through various channels of the Syrian border. Each group possesses a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the Gulf monarchies, Israel, Turkey, NATO, and of course, the US. This is confirmed in Draitser's article. Yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though Assad possessed broad support in 2011 . The truth is that the war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent. It has been acknowledged by UN sources that despite reforms, the Syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character . Syria's own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the Syrian people. Healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens . Syria also possesses a secular government where Muslims, Christians, and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war. Syria is thus a poor example of neo-liberalism. What economic struggles that do exist in Syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the US in 2004. “The war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent.” Furthermore, Draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the Syrian government and, by extension, the Syrian people. One of the sources receives much of its information from the White Helmets. The White Helmets have long been exposed as an NGO that works directly in service of imperialism's regime change operation in Syria. The organization receives approximately 33 million in funds directly from the US and UK governments. Eva Bartlett recently visited Aleppo and witnessed many White Helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups . Draister also cites a source from the New York Post . The Post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious Center for International Justice and Accountability. This purported ""international law"" NGO is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers, former or current Amnesty International staffers, and various other servants of empire. The organization specializes in ""transitional justice."" In other words, the Center for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders. Draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the Syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in Syria. The NGOs and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground. Aleppo is case and point. A ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late October that was supposed to allow Syrians to escape safely from East to West Aleppo. However, the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the Nusra Front , the US-backed Al Qaeda affiliate . The media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefire’s failure was due to the withholding of aid by Russia and Syria . This is but one example of many where the Syrian government has been blamed for the rebel-sponsored terror inflicted on Syrian people. “His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination.” After five years of war on Syria, it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries. They lied about the origins of the conflict. They have continuously blamed the Syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support. This includes the Houla Massacre , the sarin gas attack in Ghouta, and the so-called starvation of Madaya . Aleppo is no different. The Syrian city has been under constant siege from NATO-backed terrorists. The terrorists are holding nearly 250,000 Syrians hostage in the Eastern side of war-torn Aleppo. This has been verified by journalists on the ground such as Vanessa Beeley . These facts seem not to matter in Draitser's newfound assessment of Syria. His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination. Calling those who unequivocally support the Syrian government ""fetishists"" assumes that the US left should take a position different from that of the Syrian people. Actual Syrians supported Bashar Al-Assad, and thus the Syrian Army, with 88.7 percent of the vote in the 2014 elections. To claim that the left in the US should fight for ""peace"" and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war. As Howard Zinn brilliantly stated, one cannot be neutral on a moving train. And the imperialist war against Syria is moving dangerously toward a World War III scenario. Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a no-fly zone once in office. A no-fly zone would place Russian and Syrian military assets at risk of US-sponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since World War II. How convenient it is then that Draitser should rebuke his former anti-imperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change. The world is on fire, yet Draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation . “Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight.” Positions such as Draitser’s are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline. White supremacy has been a principle condition of US imperialism since its inception. The war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected. The peoples and nations on imperialism's hit-list are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for US and Western military medicine. This notion has trickled down to the day-to-day actions of ordinary people, including what currently passes as the ""anti-war"" movement in the US today. Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight. Indeed, the Syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war. But an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the Syrian people. At the moment, this means the US left must align itself with the Syrian government and its allies. The left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder. Syria should be no exception. Of course, this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on Draitser himself. His body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and Empire. He has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the US imperialist order. However, when mistakes are made, the left has a responsibility to correct them. There is too much at stake. Failure to step up in defense of Syria means another regime, change scenario similar to what happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya. Draitser's piece is a study into the path that all genuine anti-imperialists should avoid. But what is the correct path forward? Imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in Syria, so imperialism must be the primary target of an anti-imperialist movement. The US and its allies are risking world war over Syria’s destruction. On the other side, the Syrian and Russian governments (along with Iran and China) are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects Syria’s national sovereignty.

62,"WASHINGTON  —   The Pentagon next month will announce the repeal of a policy banning transgender people from serving openly in the military, Defense Department officials said on Friday, moving to end what has widely been seen as one of the last barriers to service. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has called the regulation outdated and harmful to the military. A year ago, he directed officials from all the military branches to determine what changes would be needed to lift the ban, in a tacit recognition that thousands of transgender people were already in uniform. Under the Pentagon’s plan, first reported by USA Today, each branch will put in place policies covering recruiting, housing and uniforms for transgender troops. Military officials have been “making great progress, holding multiple meetings and working hard to come up with a policy that balances the needs of soldiers with mission readiness,” said Eric Pahon, a Defense Department spokesman. “They’re trying to come up with something that fits the needs of all of the different services. ” Ashley   the president of the American Military Partner Association, a support network for partners and spouses of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender troops and veterans, said in a statement that “our transgender service members and their families are breathing a huge sigh of relief. ” Estimates of the number of transgender people in the 1. 2   military range from 2, 000 to more than 15, 000. As with the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that applied to gay men, lesbians and bisexuals until it was lifted in 2011, current rules have done little to keep transgender people out of the military. Instead, they have forced many to lie about their status and keep it a secret. Since taking the defense secretary post in February 2015, Mr. Carter has set about dismantling discriminatory rules in the services, including opening all combat positions to women. This week, Eric K. Fanning formally took over as Army secretary, becoming the first openly gay leader of a military service branch. A study commissioned by Mr. Carter and completed in March found that letting transgender members openly serve would cost little and would have no significant effect on unit readiness. The study, by the RAND Corporation, estimated that 2, 450   members of the military were transgender, and that every year about 65 service members would seek to make a gender transition. The study said that if the Pentagon did not cover medical procedures like hormone therapy and surgery, service members would most likely not seek medical care and have higher rates of substance abuse and suicide. The procedures would cost the Pentagon $2. 9 million to $4. 2 million a year, the report said. Each year, the military spends $6 billion of its $610 billion budget on medical costs for   service members.",,468,21.272727272727273,22,0.38247863247863245,0,0,0,0,97.86483587061622,5.756410256410256,73.22193732193732,22.459466459466462,0.8311965811965812,0.014957264957264958,0.03418803418803419,0.010683760683760684,0.027777777777777776,0.029914529914529916,0.15384615384615385,0.002136752136752137,0,0.008547008547008548,0.09188034188034189,0.002136752136752137,0.06196581196581197,0.02564102564102564,0.002136752136752137,0.01282051282051282,0.010683760683760684,0.07692307692307693,0,0.06623931623931624,0.019230769230769232,0.042735042735042736,0,0.002136752136752137,0.01282051282051282,0.021367521367521368,0.13247863247863248,0,0.004273504273504274,0.002136752136752137,0.00641025641025641,0,0.00641025641025641,0.04487179487179487,0.004273504273504274,0.004273504273504274,0.3974358974358974,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.004273504273504274,0,0.03418803418803419,0.00641025641025641,0,0.014957264957264958,0.004273504273504274,0.002136752136752137,0.008547008547008548,0.010683760683760684,0.010683760683760684,0.010683760683760684,0.014957264957264958,0.004273504273504274,0.002136752136752137,0.053418803418803416,0.23931623931623933,0.010683760683760684,0,0.017094017094017096,0.05128205128205128,0.0811965811965812,0.010683760683760684,0.01282051282051282,0.07478632478632478,0.15384615384615385,0.04487179487179487,0.021367521367521368,0,0.017094017094017096,0.1111111111111111,0,0.00641025641025641,0.008547008547008548,0.002136752136752137,0.002136752136752137,0,0.010683760683760684,0.002136752136752137,0.08333333333333333,0.05555555555555555,0,0.010683760683760684,0.00641025641025641,0.042735042735042736,0.11324786324786325,0.1282051282051282,0.002136752136752137,0.0641025641025641,0,5,0,39,8.5,0,1,0,20,1.83,18,13,0,3,0,5,0,25.490000000000002,1,74.5,100.99,25.490000000000002,,0.19248405980003652,0,0.6502581854091413,0.2883684682227757,0,0.045503819962193694,0,0.4880884817015154,0.08024141893385256,0.4618205632866772,0.3826210351447948,0,0.12512420160141322,0,0.3826210351447948,0,0.04677150039450265,0.0018348960531385896,0.13669975595882494,0.18530615240646617,-0.767671677800766,0.8146938475935338,24
63,"PRINCEVILLE, N. C.  —   Betty Cobb’s house is a shell nearly two months after floodwaters went halfway up the walls of her   home. Volunteers have ripped out moldy wallboard. Two small chandeliers hung over the bones of the living and dining rooms, the furniture and the carpeting long gone. On the kitchen counter lay a patchwork of family photographs, their vibrant colors washed away, and a book  —   “Hurricane Floyd and the Flood of the Century”  —   saved from the water. Hurricane Floyd, which roared through here in 1999, was supposed to be just that: a     event that caused flooding the likes of which this town’s residents would never see again. But that perception was shattered in early October when Hurricane Matthew barreled inland and sent water pouring around a levee built along the Tar River and into the town, inundating hundreds of homes, including Ms. Cobb’s. Seventeen years ago, Ms. Cobb decided to rebuild, here in a town that has a special place in American history. Princeville, population 2, 100, is believed to be the oldest town chartered by freed slaves, who founded a community that has survived numerous floods and the Jim Crow era. It remains 96 percent black. Ms. Cobb, 69, is now considering a question looming over many homeowners: After two devastating floods, does she want the option to sell her home to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, something that the town’s leaders voted down in 1999, fearing it would lead to the end of their community? “This is home, this is what I know,” said Ms. Cobb, who was leaning toward staying but worried about taking out a loan to rebuild. “I really don’t know. ” A number of residents have expressed an interest in selling to FEMA, which would prevent anyone from building again on their   land and lead to a reduction in the town’s tax base. The town’s four commissioners will vote at some point on whether to make that available to residents (the mayor votes in case of a tie). They can also consider elevation of homes and reconstruction of damaged ones. Residents on the nation’s coasts and along inland waterways have assessed storm damage and wondered if they should relocate  —   a painful and fairly uncommon form of hazard mitigation known as retreat. Here, the consideration has a wrenching historical dimension. This is where a freed slave, Turner Prince, established Freedom Hill in 1865, which became Princeville 20 years later, a town where extended families have proudly lived for generations. And many of them are determined to rebuild. This stretch along the Tar River is no stranger to flooding, and some say that it is probably the reason that   were able to settle the land in the first place. White landowners in the 19th century did not want it. “Their existence in this space was not a matter of chance or choice, but instead the discarded and unwanted space was what former slaveholders allowed them to occupy,” Richard M. Mizelle, Jr. an associate professor of history at the University of Houston, wrote earlier this year, tying Princeville’s location to environmental racism  —   the relegation of black people to   land and hazardous areas that expose them to greater levels of pollution. But many people are proud of what they have built here, and how it has endured. “The freed slaves made it what it is,” said Mayor Bobbie Jones, 55, who wants the levee improved and opposes the buyouts and hopes residents who want to leave will first seek private buyers, perhaps like himself. “If we decide to allow individuals to participate in the buyout, it will have a devastating effect,” Mr. Jones said, standing in front of more than 100 residents at a recent meeting. Other   towns like Eatonville, Fla. which was incorporated in 1887, still exist today. Many others have faded, like Nicodemus, Kan. which has about 25 residents, or Blackdom, N. M. which was abandoned after a drought. “I’m fighting so hard to make sure that Princeville is not one of the casualties,” Mr. Jones said. “It would be a devastating tragedy, not only for me, but for the world. ” Still, residents like Angela   46, want at least the option to move beyond this   land. “That history will never be lost,” said Ms.   whose small white house filled with floodwater after Matthew. The town’s founders, she said, would have settled safer land if they had the chance. “I really believe that they would want better for us,” Ms.   said. In 1967, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a levee that held off floods until Hurricane Floyd’s sent water over its top, forcing harrowing rooftop rescues  —   including Mr. Jones’s  —   and damaging or ruining nearly every home here. The town leadership rejected taking buyouts at that time and instead chose to rebuild the town and fix the levee. Last year, the Corps of Engineers completed another proposal to extend the levee, which officials with the corps say would have at least reduced the latest destruction, but it has not been funded. The flood inundated community pillars like the school and the fire station  —   which is currently operating out of a tent  —   and left residents displaced and streets still piled with debris. “So many people have lost so much, and we’ll have to start all over again,” Linda Worsley, 66, a retired telephone company analyst, said as she picked up the mail at her uninhabitable home even as it was being demolished. Ms. Worsley is determined to rebuild on land that has been in her family since her grandfather, a sharecropper, and his brother bought it in the 1920s. Ms. Worsley, who as a commissioner voted against buyouts in 1999, said residents should have the option this time, although she hopes few people will take them. “I have always been proud to say that I was from Princeville,” Ms. Worsley said, adding, “To just lose all of that, it would be like Princeville is another lost colony. ” It was her job to organize the town’s Christmas parade, which was scheduled for last Saturday but had to be canceled. Instead, Ms. Worsley and her neighbors gathered at the Quality Inn in Tarboro, which is across the Tar River from Princeville, for a lunch of pulled pork, chicken and green beans. So many displaced residents are staying at the hotel while they await FEMA trailers that it has become a stop for the school bus, its lobby a town square for Princeville residents. Mary Alston, a volunteer from Cary, N. C. put the question to Ms. Worsley and two of her friends, “Are y’all going to stay or   …    ” “I’m going to stay,” Annette Waller, 60, said. “Oh yes,” Brenda Hunter said, “I’m going to stay in Princeville,” and talk at the table turned to demolition, duct work and how long it would take to return home. Others in the hotel have decided to leave. David Birth, 70, a retired machine operator, whose home on Main Street was destroyed, said he had already bought land in Tarboro and would live there, in a trailer. “When the first flood came, it took the first house,’’ he said. “The second flood took this one. I’m not going to let my grandchildren be in the same situation. ” For now, many families are waiting: waiting to see how far flood insurance goes, what FEMA will offer, and what the town decides. Back at Ms. Cobb’s house, as volunteers carted away wheelbarrows filled with wallboard, Ms. Cobb’s daughter, Regina, 48, looked across the street where trees hide the Tar River. If it were up to her, she said, she would leave, although she said she would support her mother’s decision. “We were supposed to be on a   flood plain, and we only made it through 17 years,” Regina Cobb said. “That river isn’t going anywhere. ”",,1322,20.03030303030303,66,0.27685325264750377,0,0,0,0,85.02653889227263,28.2620440410153,70.97219468934216,23.404758630174666,0.819213313161876,0.018910741301059002,0.031013615733736764,0.037821482602118005,0.03177004538577912,0.012859304084720122,0.20726172465960666,0.0022692889561270802,0.0015128593040847202,0.018910741301059002,0.0794251134644478,0.0007564296520423601,0.07791225416036308,0.012859304084720122,0.0007564296520423601,0.012859304084720122,0.00680786686838124,0.094553706505295,0.0022692889561270802,0.08472012102874432,0.0226928895612708,0.0529500756429652,0,0.0007564296520423601,0.0264750378214826,0.02042360060514372,0.07337367624810892,0,0.00680786686838124,0.0022692889561270802,0.024962178517397883,0,0.01059001512859304,0.059757942511346446,0.0015128593040847202,0.0015128593040847202,0.4720121028744327,0.00529500756429652,0.01588502269288956,0.025718608169440244,0.00832072617246596,0.06202723146747353,0.0015128593040847202,0.00680786686838124,0.019667170953101363,0.024962178517397883,0.00680786686838124,0.007564296520423601,0.009833585476550681,0.018910741301059002,0.00832072617246596,0.01664145234493192,0,0.0007564296520423601,0.02723146747352496,0.25642965204236007,0.00680786686838124,0.0007564296520423601,0.02723146747352496,0.06202723146747353,0.06202723146747353,0.040090771558245086,0.015128593040847202,0.03555219364599092,0.13540090771558244,0.1021180030257186,0.01588502269288956,0.0007564296520423601,0.031013615733736764,0.15809379727685324,0.0007564296520423601,0.006051437216338881,0.006051437216338881,0.00832072617246596,0.00832072617246596,0,0,0.01664145234493192,0.09379727685325265,0.09304084720121028,0,0.0226928895612708,0.01059001512859304,0.05068078668683813,0.1475037821482602,0.15582450832072617,0.0037821482602118004,0.0226928895612708,0.0007564296520423601,70.35,0,78,4,10.2,19,20,20,1.83,64.975,30,5,24.2,12,70.35,2,130.21,39,216.1,379.31,130.21,,0.659437666011797,0,0.682224867456916,0.09917731364776043,0.21920491080424767,0.3433829830388197,0.3550392228080413,0.3550392228080413,0.04795370753571764,0.6413685682966591,0.45227173208356436,0.12097221717826216,0.3997898344543706,0.24828371682826428,0.7721526878690156,0.05217599429965031,0.08116261819723121,0.024309516240626813,0.1346996528102424,0.2364318616726194,-0.7697583970356613,0.7635681383273806,97
64,"Print Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. First, I’m writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think I’m someone special or that what I do should influence you. Second, I’m not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, there’s a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trump’s failings, constantly saying, “Let him who is without sin cast the first one” (see John 8:7). This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been: 1) During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would re-evaluate my position. 2) Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3) I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. (For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here .) So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump? The culture war is not over! Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Brown’s latest book, “Outlasting the Gay Revolution: Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide” First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-Constitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if you’re pro-life, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system (although, unfortunately, he’s been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system), so my vote for him is also a protest vote. Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means I’m in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, “We’re electing a president, not a pastor,” was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, “We’re electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor,” it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer (even if hedoes appoint righteous judges), and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example (although we pray he will be truly converted and become one). Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a born-again Christian (I see absolutely no evidence of this), the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. Seventh, although I’m quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, I’m far more concerned with what we as God’s people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words (and warning) of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: “The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority.” So, in sum: 1) My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America; 2) My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3) I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4) Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. Either way, though, my vote is just that: a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution.

65,"GREEN BAY, Wis.  —   Donald J. Trump belatedly endorsed the   of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte on Friday, moving to heal a deepening rift within the Republican Party touched off by Mr. Trump’s feud with the parents of a slain American soldier. “I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,” Mr. Trump said at a rally here after announcing his backing of the senators. “He’s a good man. We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree. ” Mr. Trump ignited a controversy within his party on Tuesday when he said he was not “quite there yet” in supporting Mr. Ryan, echoing a similar line of doubt that Mr. Ryan, the nation’s most powerful elected Republican, had cast before eventually endorsing Mr. Trump for president. The endorsement on Friday, in Mr. Ryan’s home state, Wisconsin, had the rollout of a carefully crafted campaign event. A   email was sent to supporters immediately after Mr. Trump’s announcement. Moments later, subscribers to Trump campaign texts received an alert that said, “Party unity will help Make America Great Again. ” He read the endorsement from a script. But before he got to those words, he spent several minutes in the    mode he is known for. He predicted that the Green Bay Packers would have a strong season, excoriated Hillary Clinton and argued that the news media had misconstrued his suggestion at a previous event that a crying baby be escorted out. “The baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti,” he said, adding, “I want to sponsor that baby. ” Mr. Trump turned the speech into a   trifecta. He threw his support to Ms. Ayotte, who is facing a tight race in New Hampshire to retain her Senate seat. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain, an Arizona senator, are also up for   beginning with primaries next week. “I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the change we have to make,” Mr. Trump said. He added, “I understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan’s big tent within the party. ” “Big, big tent,” he said. “Remember?” He paused to ask the Democrats in the crowd to raise their hands. Hardly anyone made a sound. Mr. Trump, looking unimpressed, offered that he did not need Democrats anyway. With the speech, Mr. Trump sought to move past a tumultuous week that began with his disparaging members of a Gold Star military family who had spoken out against him at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump’s remarks drew rebukes from many Republicans, including Mr. Ryan, Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte, and set the course for the next few days. He caused a tempest with his remarks regarding Mr. Ryan and another with repeated proclamations about viewing a “secret tape” that showed Iran receiving pallets of cash from the United States. Perhaps signaling that he was in a forgiving and unifying mood, Mr. Trump on Friday morning issued a rare admission of an error, explaining on Twitter that the footage he had thought was a secret tape was instead a widely shown clip of American prisoners arriving in Geneva after being released by Iran. His squabbling with Mr. Ryan and the senators threatened to further splinter Mr. Trump’s relationship with the party and infuriated many officials, including Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, publicly, but peacefully, disagreed with him and backed Mr. Ryan. Mr. Priebus had made clear he hoped that Mr. Trump would get behind Mr. Ryan and the senators but told the nominee that he had to make the decision on his own. The endorsement of Mr. Ryan is unlikely to assuage some Republicans who are concerned by the combative Trump campaign and have grown frustrated that the   controversies have made it more difficult to focus on Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee. On Friday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio told CNN that he was considering voting Democratic for the first time. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Mr. Kasich said in response to a question on the possibility that he would not vote for a Republican for president. He added: “I wish that I could be fully enthusiastic. I can’t be. So I don’t know what’s going to happen at the end. ” In Wisconsin, a battleground state where Mr. Trump lost a primary decisively to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and endured unrelenting criticism from local conservative radio hosts, the speaker of the State House of Representatives greeted Mr. Trump with an open letter to fellow Republicans, saying, “We are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans. ” “As Donald Trump has said stupid things and been rude to so many people over the past year, I usually chalked it up to inexperience and the spotlight of an incredibly hostile press,” the speaker, Robin Vos, wrote. “But since the convention, his lack of judgment has got to concern even the most ardent Trump supporters. ” And less than an hour before Mr. Trump took the stage, Mr. Ryan gave an interview to WISN, a Milwaukee radio station, offering more criticism of the presidential nominee. “I hope he doesn’t keep doing things like this and distort conservative principles that we have to defend,” Mr. Ryan told the station. He said he had not “changed anything” with regard to his support of Mr. Trump, but added: “I wish he would be a little more disciplined. What I say to him privately and what I’ve said publicly is Hillary Clinton is the one to focus on, not another Republican, not a private citizen criticizing you. ” Mr. Trump made his endorsement after striking notes of unity on Friday afternoon at a rally in Des Moines. He praised Mr. Priebus, saying he was doing a “fantastic job,” and complimented Mr. Pence, who was on the campaign trail with him for the first time since they had taken divergent positions on Mr. Ryan’s primary campaign. “If you don’t like me, that’s O. K.,” Mr. Trump told the Iowa crowd. “Vote for Pence because it’s the same thing. ” Mr. Trump also focused his message in Des Moines on Mrs. Clinton, peppering his remarks with extended riffs and insult lines against her and President Obama. “She is pretty close to unhinged,” Mr. Trump said, criticizing Mrs. Clinton’s immigration and foreign policy positions, in particular with regard to Iran. He also floated a conspiracy theory that the National Security Agency had the 33, 000 deleted emails from Mrs. Clinton’s account (there is no record, report or indication that this is true). “Does N. S. A. have them? I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. “Some people have been saying that, that the N. S. A. has them. ” The Clinton campaign has been quick to seize on Mr. Trump’s recent controversies. At a rally Friday afternoon in Milwaukee, the Democratic   nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, took aim at Mr. Trump for withholding endorsements of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain. “While we’ve been talking about jobs, Donald Trump has been going after a family of a war hero, or Donald Trump has been going after fellow Republicans and talking about why he won’t endorse them in their primaries,” Mr. Kaine said. “We’re talking about jobs, and Donald Trump is basically shadowboxing with every enemy he can think of instead of talking about what Americans want to talk about. ”",,1261,18.014285714285716,70,0.28786677240285485,0,0,0,0,91.30440693327292,3.458169137233372,90.31449347437466,36.96956017812481,0.7620935765265662,0.0055511498810467885,0.03727200634417129,0.025376685170499604,0.04440919904837431,0.020618556701030927,0.2260111022997621,0.011895321173671689,0.0015860428231562252,0.020618556701030927,0.08564631245043616,0.0015860428231562252,0.0626486915146709,0.0023790642347343376,0.0007930214115781126,0.012688342585249802,0.0031720856463124504,0.07216494845360824,0.0015860428231562252,0.0626486915146709,0.0190325138778747,0.03727200634417129,0,0.0015860428231562252,0.01823949246629659,0.011895321173671689,0.11498810467882632,0,0.004758128469468675,0.0031720856463124504,0.007137192704203013,0.0007930214115781126,0.00951625693893735,0.061855670103092786,0.0023790642347343376,0.0023790642347343376,0.44409199048374304,0.0007930214115781126,0.02458366375892149,0.004758128469468675,0.011895321173671689,0.03727200634417129,0.003965107057890563,0,0.013481363996827915,0.008723235527359239,0.008723235527359239,0.07771609833465504,0.004758128469468675,0.011895321173671689,0.011895321173671689,0.01823949246629659,0.0023790642347343376,0,0.003965107057890563,0.1950832672482157,0.0007930214115781126,0.0007930214115781126,0.03330689928628073,0.09516256938937351,0.03330689928628073,0.06661379857256146,0.02458366375892149,0.07295796986518636,0.13639968279143536,0.10388580491673276,0.017446471054718478,0.0015860428231562252,0.04282315622521808,0.10943695479777954,0,0.011895321173671689,0.006344171292624901,0.0015860428231562252,0.0055511498810467885,0,0.0007930214115781126,0.040444091990483745,0.1625693893735131,0.05313243457573354,0,0.01823949246629659,0.004758128469468675,0.045995241871530534,0.1252973830293418,0.13322759714512292,0.007930214115781126,0.01506740681998414,0.0015860428231562252,52,0,106.65,4,17,11.3,26,34.875,10.08,49.7,16,6,80.675,0,52,4,176.585,41.3,179.85,389.43499999999995,176.585,,0.5815476678508823,0,0.7402827535685707,0.09657969325936246,0.31240482065847885,0.23195391430190393,0.4099874593387082,0.48242136855126894,0.21222583397423808,0.5704999381111412,0.2995325016467051,0.13819607273199155,0.6831562774356336,0,0.3186651818838306,0.09657969325936246,0.11389384269575958,0.026637685552764225,0.11599970330907132,0.25117789523585315,-0.10984939220467672,0.7488221047641468,100
66,"Email History should tell us that writing scolding, even scornful letters, to electorates as part of a conversation for persuasion do not work. They are even less effective when coming from outside that electorate, however well-intentioned. Non-voters should be careful to judge and lecture. Consider the attempt on the part of The Guardian to mount its electoral high horse prior to the 2004 Presidential elections in the United States. The prospect of another four years of George W. Bush was hard to stomach for the editors, hence their disruptive project. Operation Clark County was advertised as an effort to write “to undecided voters in the crucial state of Ohio.” The experiment had more than a degree of condescension, slanted, as it were, to the superior across the pond wisdom. Instead of providing a platform of sobriety, it simply supplied patriotic fuel to US voters to confirm their positions. No one was going to be telling them what to do. Their president was a fool, but was their fool. As one letter went, “We Ohioans are an ornery sort and don’t take meddling well, even if it comes from people we admire and with their sincere goodwill. We are a fairly closed community overall.” Even the New York Times came forth with an unmistakably frank headline: “British Two Cents Draws, in Sum, a Two-Word Reply: Butt Out.” Nobel Prize winner and former president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, should be more attuned with that recent history. But instead, he has decided to wade into the US elections with another letter of scorn, another experiment in persuasion. To add weight and magnification to the appeal, he is seeking the signatures of fellow Nobel Prize laureates. The direction of this letter promises to be simple: whatever you do, people of the US, don’t vote for Donald Trump next month. During a brief visit to the northern Australian town of Darwin, Ramos-Horta explained how he and his friends, “Nobel Peace Prize laureates, are extremely concerned with the tone of a presidential candidate Donald Trump in making disparaging remarks about migrants, about Muslims, and refugees.” Ramos-Horta insisted that the rise of such a figure was “extremely worrying for all of us and it does not serve US interests.” Along with his fellow laureates, he was hoping to pen a letter that would “alert American public opinion that the world … cannot afford extremism coming from the White House itself.” Ramos-Horta provides us a fairly typical, if rusted view, of world power. Empires need the wise and clever to lead them, being repositories of responsibility. Lunacy has no place. “The US is an indisputable global power and global powers have to be led with prudence, with enormous wisdom.” What of the brakes of moderation and restraint offered by a critical, at times unreasonable Congress, including other measures so carefully thought through by the Republic’s Founding Fathers? We have seen such brakes bringing the Republic to a screeching halt on occasions, notably during the Obama years. These are polarised times in US politics, and not even the supply of finance to public servants is sacred. This is of little interest to Ramos-Horta, who is convinced that a Trump presidency would have Congress in his deceptively deep pocket to wage war with impunity and engage in a pattern of global mischief making. “Whatever the US president and US congress may decide on some measure of issues internationally can enhance peace, but can provoke instability and world disorder.” Not that the record book on peace, stemming from US foreign policy in recent years, has been particularly enhancing. Having dumped generously on Trump, Ramos-Horta admits a swooning admiration for Hillary Clinton, his preferred White House occupant. If there is a candidate bound to embark on more aggressive stances, be it towards Iran or Russia, few could come close. Her recipe is for greater, not lesser belligerence. Free world boisterousness indeed. Taking leave of his senses, Ramos-Horta suggested that she was “outstanding” and “sensitive to the rest of the world”. With baffling adolescent gullibility, the Nobel Prize laureate saw a Clinton “extremely sensitive to education for poor people, for children”. A sense of balance might have been appropriate at that point: questionable donations from despotic regimes to the same, supposedly helpful foundation open to helping the indigent and illiterate; or security breaches; or compromised arrangements with Wall Street. The world of power is dark, and maze ridden, and at the end of it usually lurks a Clinton apology. A Clinton presidency would hardly be that prudent, nor particularly wise, but that is the Ramos-Horta verdict, his own variant of an external endorsement that is bound to fall on deaf ears in the United States. Any ears who receive the message will be dismissive. From a man whose country suffered an occupation that will, in time, find its way into the books of notable genocides, endorsing such a Clinton can hardly be prudent. But then again, power of the massive sort rarely is.",,844,19.627906976744185,43,0.35308056872037913,0,0,0,0,90.19176525940121,12.105587258600119,76.50753985351142,74.33282372725883,0.7867298578199052,0.01066350710900474,0.045023696682464455,0.03909952606635071,0.0485781990521327,0.027251184834123223,0.16943127962085308,0.0035545023696682463,0.001184834123222749,0.0035545023696682463,0.08530805687203792,0.001184834123222749,0.07938388625592417,0.008293838862559242,0.004739336492890996,0.013033175355450236,0.009478672985781991,0.10071090047393365,0.004739336492890996,0.06635071090047394,0.016587677725118485,0.04739336492890995,0.014218009478672985,0.002369668246445498,0.027251184834123223,0.016587677725118485,0.08412322274881516,0,0.001184834123222749,0.002369668246445498,0.002369668246445498,0,0.011848341232227487,0.026066350710900472,0.0035545023696682463,0.0035545023696682463,0.4881516587677725,0.002369668246445498,0.004739336492890996,0.002369668246445498,0,0.04383886255924171,0.004739336492890996,0.001184834123222749,0.022511848341232227,0.01066350710900474,0.002369668246445498,0.016587677725118485,0.0071090047393364926,0.02132701421800948,0.013033175355450236,0.01066350710900474,0,0.002369668246445498,0.0071090047393364926,0.1872037914691943,0,0,0.016587677725118485,0.0509478672985782,0.0485781990521327,0.04383886255924171,0.03672985781990521,0.04028436018957346,0.1528436018957346,0.08767772511848342,0.016587677725118485,0.001184834123222749,0.026066350710900472,0.12085308056872038,0.002369668246445498,0.009478672985781991,0.004739336492890996,0.001184834123222749,0.0071090047393364926,0.002369668246445498,0,0.014218009478672985,0.09360189573459715,0.07109004739336493,0.001184834123222749,0.026066350710900472,0.009478672985781991,0.031990521327014215,0.10545023696682465,0.11374407582938388,0.018957345971563982,0.03672985781990521,0.001184834123222749,84.825,1,24.625,5,34,4.95,3,31,3.83,36.099999999999994,17,6,24,0,84.825,5,153.485,20.9,123.44999999999999,289.51,153.485,,0.7430962573406028,0.032975269612608105,0.45643474815076385,0.14566321315706804,0.5369063368046207,0.144416943385576,0.09280525239916695,0.5138766879788003,0.11551538535302,0.5517704628505312,0.36696648363032597,0.16984774221284243,0.45006393779411497,0,0.4255568663046737,0.14566321315706804,0.1454131178292958,0.019800854563196937,0.11695767922615606,0.2742844691191936,0.5915727267024186,0.7257155308808064,78
67,"MARSEILLE, France  —   They sang. They danced, they chanted, they even  —   for some reason  —   did the Icelandic Thunderclap routine a few times. But mostly the French fans at the Stade Velodrome on Thursday just sang as one, long and loud and proud. Sometimes it was the national anthem. Sometimes it was the chorus to “Seven Nation Army” by the White Stripes. Sometimes it was just “Allez!” (roughly, Let’s Go!) over and over. In truth, it did not matter what they were singing. On this night, in this moment, the fans wanted simply to join in. To make a difference. To matter. And they did. Beneath a relentless, rambunctious cacophony, France defeated Germany,   in a semifinal of the European Championships. The French, who won the last two major tournaments they have hosted, will go for a third against Portugal on Sunday at the Stade de France outside Paris. Germany, the defending World Cup champion, will go home. The Germans will rue injuries that cost them two starters (plus a suspension that ruled out one more) as well as an avalanche of missed opportunities and  —   in their minds, at least  —   a controversial referee’s decision that stunned them just before halftime. The French, of course, will say otherwise. To them, they had just 35 percent possession but defended ferociously they deserved the penalty kick awarded to them late in the first half, which they converted and they capitalized when the German defense scrambled itself in front of goal. Antoine Griezmann scored both goals for France. When he poked the second across the line after a flailing clearance by Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a frisson of unadulterated euphoria pulsed through the stands. This was, by far, the most difficult test the French had faced in this tournament, and they flourished. “We are like kids playing out here,” Griezmann said. “We know we have a whole nation behind us. ” The last time these teams met was Nov. 13 at the Stade de France, a match that will always be remembered for what happened outside  —   the terrorist attacks in St.  and Paris  —   as opposed to anything that took place on the field. That night, Griezmann played while his sister, Maud, was inside the Bataclan concert hall where terrorists attacked with guns and grenades. It was only later, well after the match, that he learned she was one of the fortunate who escaped. The specter of those attacks has lingered over this event from the beginning, as security around the country was increased exponentially. François Hollande, the French president, even visited the French team before its first match to talk about the situation. Griezmann, recalling that meeting on Thursday, said the players understood that it was their job, their responsibility, to entertain their supporters, to give them verve and energy and excitement  —   to help the country move forward. The team began with a dramatic victory over Romania in the tournament’s opening game. Then it won its preliminary round group. In the knockout rounds, it stormed back against Ireland in the round of 16, blitzed Iceland in the quarterfinal and here, on this steamy, sticky night, pushed over the world champions. “There is happiness all over France tonight,” Manager Didier Deschamps said. It was not always pretty. Germany, which beat France in the quarterfinals two years ago on its way to the World Cup title in Brazil, weathered a French surge after the opening whistle and dominated for nearly 40 minutes of the first half. Mesut Özil was slick in the midfield, as usual. Thomas Müller was threatening in front of goal. Jérôme Boateng, the sturdy defender, helped hem the French into their own half. Yet there was no finish. France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was ready when called on  —   he made a fine stop to deny Emre Can after about 15 minutes  —   but the Germans also lacked polish when it mattered most. The final cross was just a bit too high, the outstretched leg a bit too short. A   score at halftime seemed reasonable and both sides appeared happy to accept it. Only then France earned a corner kick a few minutes before the interval and, as the ball swung in, Germany’s captain, Bastian Schweinsteiger, challenged for it with his arms raised. When it deflected off Patrice Evra’s head and caromed directly into Schweinsteiger’s right arm, the referee, Nicola Rizzoli, pointed to the penalty spot. Was it a good call? Current guidance on handling directs officials to penalize players if, among other things, they “make themselves bigger,” and Schweinsteiger seemed to do that. The Germans, nonetheless, were incensed the French, naturally, were ecstatic. Griezmann stepped up. A little more than a month ago he missed a crucial penalty kick as his club team, Atlético Madrid, was beaten in a shootout in the Champions League final by Real Madrid. This time, however, there was no hiccup. His   shot was pure. “Everybody was shocked,” Germany Manager Joachim Löw said. “I had to calm the players down in the dressing room at halftime. ” He added: “And then, after, it was difficult. ” The second half brought more chances, but more frustration for Germany. Toni Kroos had his run cut off. Julian Draxler curled a shot just wide. Joshua Kimmich saw his powerful drive ricochet off the post. Meanwhile, Greizmann slipped in front of the German goal just as Paul Pogba went into a dazzling dance on the left side of the penalty area. Shucking off a defender, Pogba floated a cross that Neuer could only bat to the ground. Griezmann, who stands just 5 feet 9 inches, pounced, poked and  —   after the ball rippled the net  —   preened in front of the delirious fans. “He’s our little man who gives us something more,” forward Olivier Giroud said. Löw said that the Germans were unlucky, that France was not the better team. Deschamps did not necessarily disagree, saying that the Germans made France suffer. Still, he said, it made no difference. At this level, all that matters is the result. And so, after the final whistle, the French players went to each end of the stadium, joined hands in a line and, as a unit, offered gratitude to their supporters. The world champions had been eliminated. The final was in sight. The dream was ever closer. On this night, the combination had been unbeatable: the French players gave their hearts.

69,"by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente . Tomorrow, election day will be only one week away. In this post I want to talk about two distinct subjects. First, I want to talk about the sort of calculation that a Martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth. Then, I’d like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like, in a world where I didn’t want to claw out my eyeballs. A Martian Looks at Election Outcomes in 2016 I say “Martian,” because a Martian is so detached that the 30,000-foot view looks like a close-up, and I think in this election detachment is a virtue (see above at “claw out my eyeballs”). So a Martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury, the numbers have not been that crazy (assuming one trusts them). Among registered voters: Emphasizing how remarkably stable the &#39;16 race has been — going back to Sept. 2015 https://t.co/odFykkIm8m pic.twitter.com/2CKuS9Qi9G &mdash; Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 31, 2016 RealClearPolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger. To me, the pattern of the race is that Clinton starts out with, and retains, a natural institutional advantage of around four points. Again from the head-to-head RCP chart, Trump has closed and then pulled even six times: September 2015, December 2015, February 2016, May 2016, July 2016, and September 2016. And each time either Clinton’s institutional advantages have re-asserted themselves, or Trump has shot himself in the foot (take your pick). Trump is closing now. Can he pull ahead and close the deal? Unknown. Based on past performance, no. Then again, as I remarked before the latest email eruption, “a week is a long time in politics,” Wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe, and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go. Paradoxically, Martians are not warlike, since the thin air, small population, and harsh conditions on Mars make war a species-threatening event. For the same reason, Martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious. And Martians resist “Marsization,” because the one time there actually was a single, Mars-wide, cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the Earth, and who knows where that would have led! So if you were a Martian, and you believed that Clinton’s election would lead to a new war , and you believe that endorsing Bowles-Simpson and “hemispheric trade” in a speech at Goldman Sachs mean a Grand Bargain and TPP passage respectively, then you might look askance at a likely Clinton victory. What do do? If you had a Martian friend who followed American elections obsessively — this is similar to Southeast Asian countries where people obsessively follow English Premier League football — this is what your friend might tell you: The last thing you want is for Clinton to be able to enact her (real, private) agenda. Sure, she might make some small good changes, but if you throw war, a Grand Bargain, and the surrender of national sovereignty with another so-called trade deal on one side of the scale, it’s hard to see what outweighs them on the other, at least in terms of concrete material benefits.[1] So, working on the assumption that Clinton will win, what you need is: A Republican House . Here, the checks and balances built into the American system favor gridlock, and gridlock is your friend, since little legislation will get passed. Whether the House Republicans impeach Clinton if the Senate is in Democrat hands is an open question, but with Clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the Clinton Foundation , the Clinton administration will provide a target-rich environment. I woudn’t put it past them to try to take Clinton’s security clearance away! A Democrat Senate . The emergence of left(ish) party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016. Warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power, and Sanders, while not a Bolshevik, is well to the left of the Democrat mainstream. That’s a Good Thing. Both are prolific fundraisers who don’t need the DNC. If the Republicans hold the Senate, the tendency will be for Democrats to stick together. If the Democrats do, then Baron Warren and Baron Sanders (and allies like Sherrod Brown ) will feel more free to drag the party left. A close race . If Clinton wins, she’ll claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent. But in the same way that anybody can print money, but the trick is getting other people to accept it, others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is. (I think the result would have to be better than the four points Obama beat Romney by — 51.1% to 47.2% — and as of today, Clinton’s margin is 2.8% in RCP’s four-way average .) Of course, Bush claimed a mandate in 2004, too — true story: I managed to Google-bomb “Bush mandate” to Mandate magazine, back in the day when Google-bombing wasn’t hard — and proceeded to try to gut Social Security, whereupon the Democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 mid-terms. But why make it easy? So, that’s the Martian perspective on the race. Surprisingly or not, the personal characteristics of puny Earthling candidates are not a factor! Nor are cultural or class markers! Elections on Mars Here is how Election Day works on Mars. Again because of planetary and cultural characteristics, Martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things, like distributed Martian parallel chess, or space operas. They are also convivial, and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces (that time the Jovians invaded). Obviously, I can’t provide links for most of this — the Uniform Resource Locator is a global standard, not an interplanetary one — but in short form: 1. On Mars, Election Day is a national holiday. That’s because Martians, unlike American Earthlings, think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote. Voting is equally easy for almost every Martian, whether they work or not. 2. The Martians use hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public. This is remarkably similar to international standards on Earth (which the United States does not use): Last March, the country’s highest court found that secret, computerized vote counting was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the country was Germany, and the Constitution violated by e-voting systems was the one that the U.S. wrote and insisted Germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following WWII. Paul Lehto, a U.S. election attorney and Constitutional rights expert, summarized the German court’s unambiguous, landmark finding : “No ‘specialized technical knowledge’ can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts.” There is a “constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count.” “[T]he government substitution of its own check or what we’d probably call an ‘audit’ is no substitute at all for public observation.” “A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards. “As a result of these principles,…’all independent observers’ conclude that ‘electronic voting machines are totally banned in Germany’ because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements of…being both ‘observable’ and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge. Hand-counting paper ballots is no good at all, argue critics, unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was… After the verdict in the case — filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son — Lehto wondered how it could be that open, observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for “conquered Nazis,” but not, apparently, for citizens of the United States… 3. The Martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been hand-counted. That’s partly because Martians are convivial, but also because the Martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated. (Again, because the Martian population is small, they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately, lest fratricidal violence result, and there’s no better way to do that than over food.) 4. The Martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size (small) and frequency (not often), whether for candidates or policies. That’s because the Martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging face-to-face forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible. 5. The Martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election. That’s because Martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons, and that elections (unlike markets) are not (manipulative) beauty contests. Conclusions Crazy Martians! What are they thinking? NOTES [1] Sadly, the time for an all-out assault on Republican “obstructionism” was 2009, when all the stars had aligned: The Republicans had no credibility, and the Democrats had the House, the Senate, the most powerful orator of our time (so it was said), in the White House, and a mandate for “hope and change.” Of course, Obama (assuming good faith) squandered this opportunity, starting with his inaugural speech, if not before. APPENDIX And then there’s Evan McMullin, doing well in Utah . I haven’t seen any actual evidence that he’s Mitt Romney’s straw in case of some kinda electoral college debacle…. 0 0 0 0 0 0",,1619,22.802816901408452,71,0.31315626930203827,0,0,0,0.0006176652254478073,83.87651769169682,26.161629263605786,51.976528721432985,53.64793082149475,0.7764051883878937,0.017912291537986413,0.044471896232242125,0.033353922174181594,0.0426189005558987,0.011117974058060531,0.20691785052501543,0.0074119827053736875,0.0018529956763434219,0.02038295243977764,0.08832612723903645,0,0.07844348363187152,0.010500308832612723,0.009882643607164917,0.027177269919703522,0.011117974058060531,0.12538604076590487,0.005558987029030266,0.06670784434836319,0.02285361334156887,0.07226683137739345,0.013588634959851761,0.0018529956763434219,0.03705991352686844,0.017294626312538603,0.06670784434836319,0.0030883261272390363,0.0006176652254478073,0.006176652254478073,0.0030883261272390363,0,0.01605929586164299,0.022235948116121063,0.0018529956763434219,0.0018529956763434219,0.4564546016059296,0,0.005558987029030266,0.0024706609017912293,0.00926497838171711,0.04076590487955528,0.004323656578134651,0.0006176652254478073,0.024088943792464484,0.01605929586164299,0.005558987029030266,0.004941321803582459,0.0067943174799258805,0.012353304508956145,0.016676961087090797,0.013588634959851761,0.0030883261272390363,0.0012353304508956147,0.030265596046942556,0.24027177269919703,0.017294626312538603,0.010500308832612723,0.021618282890673256,0.04756022235948116,0.0426189005558987,0.035824583075972825,0.028412600370599134,0.03829524397776405,0.1179740580605312,0.0765904879555281,0.021618282890673256,0.0024706609017912293,0.01852995676343422,0.1260037059913527,0.0006176652254478073,0.013588634959851761,0.0024706609017912293,0.0012353304508956147,0.009882643607164917,0.0012353304508956147,0,0.0074119827053736875,0.05682520074119827,0.07226683137739345,0,0.030883261272390366,0.008029647930821495,0.0426189005558987,0.1272390364422483,0.13279802347127856,0.0018529956763434219,0.028412600370599134,0.00926497838171711,45.75,0,95.625,6.175000000000001,14.549999999999999,9.73,31.5,49.085,10.83,32.625,39.655,53.7,44,0,45.75,13.46,205.825,60.21,158.26,420.56499999999994,205.825,,0.548344920643128,0,0.7173243976159538,0.14079565549782672,0.27856013202810403,0.20521846572093064,0.4553149080754099,0.5657046805201487,0.22323965009547186,0.4640304413021854,0.5127499774328862,0.5876373744548632,0.5386685194483024,0,0.5406368278107635,0.26318420202809323,0.107392653001594,0.03141557943508308,0.08257481483800444,0.21943685708546276,0.6409442271918493,0.7805631429145372,123
70,"In his influential memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy” (2016) J. D. Vance explains why some   Americans turned against Michelle Obama. The first lady, he writes, “tells us that we shouldn’t be feeding our children certain foods, and we hate her for it  —   not because we think she’s wrong, but because we know she’s right. ” It is possible to dislike the philosopher Peter Singer  —   born in Australia, he teaches at Princeton University  —   along similar lines. He is right about so many things, and appears to live so much more virtuously than most of us do, that listening him can make you want to tip a turtle on its back or consume all the endangered seafood that’s left because, as a blowhard I know put it, “If we don’t eat it now, there are a billion people right behind us who will. ” Mr. Singer is best known for his book “Animal Liberation” (1975) a founding text of the contemporary   movement. More recently he has been interested in effective altruism, which asks: How can we use what we have to help others the most? He takes aim at sins of omission. In his book “The Life You Can Save” (2009) and elsewhere, he has argued that if relatively affluent Westerners do not regularly donate at least a sliver of our incomes to aid agencies, to prevent the unnecessary deaths of millions of people worldwide, we are in the moral wrong. We are complicit in something close to murder. In his new book, “Ethics in the Real World: 82 Brief Essays on Things That Matter,” Mr. Singer picks up the topics of animal rights and poverty amelioration and runs quite far with them. But he’s written better and more fully about these issues elsewhere they are not the primary reason to come to this book. “Ethics in the Real World” comprises short pieces, most of them previously published. This book is interesting because it offers a chance to witness this influential thinker grapple with more offbeat questions. Among the essay titles here: “Should Adult Sibling Incest Be a Crime?” “Is It O. K. to Cheat at Football?” “Tiger Mothers or Elephant Mothers?” “Rights for Robots?” and “Kidneys for Sale?” This book is the equivalent of a moral news conference, or a particularly good Terry Gross interview. Its informal quality is tonic. I’m reminded of a comment by the critic Wilfrid Sheed, who said he would trade half of Lord Byron’s “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage” for an interview with him, and “all of ‘Adam Bede’ for the same with George Eliot. ” The first thing that needs to be said about “Ethics in the Real World” is that the writing is mostly dishwater gray. Mr. Singer seems to regard wit as immoral adornment. He picks up his topics as if they were heavy rocks, hauls them a few feet, and drops them, sometimes on our toes. His abstemious style made me long for a despairing wisecrack. What carries you is the quality of his thought. He is persuasive on so many topics that he makes you wish we could turn the world off, then on again, in an attempt to reset it. He is an ardent critic of religion. About the notion, strong in my own childhood, that we were born with original sin because Eve flouted God’s decree against eating from the tree of knowledge, he writes: “This is a triply repellent idea, for it implies, firstly, that knowledge is a bad thing, secondly, that disobeying god’s will is the greatest sin of all, and thirdly, that children inherit the sins of their ancestors, and may be justly punished for them. ” He speaks loudly on behalf of tolerance. He believes we should allow for three categories on passports and other documents: “male, female, and indeterminate. ” He further argues that the world would be a better place if humans were not so often asked to proclaim their sex on forms. He leans in favor of permitting adult incest because for him, an essential question is always this one: “When someone proposes making something a criminal offense, we should always ask: who is harmed?” In one of my favorite passages, he zeros in on those who pay many millions of dollars for paintings while people are starving. The art critic in him emerges. Writing about the sale of paintings by artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol for obscene sums at Christie’s, he declares: “Why would anyone want to pay tens of millions of dollars for works like these? They are not beautiful, nor do they display great artistic skill. They are not even unusual within the artist’s oeuvres. Do an image search for ‘Barnett Newman’ and you will see many paintings with vertical color bars, usually divided by a thin line. Once Newman had an idea, it seems, he liked to work out all the variations. ” His bottom line: “In a more ethical world, to spend tens of millions of dollars on works of art would be   not  . ” There is an essay about how to keep a New Year’s resolution. In another he denounces the trend, seen in some Manhattan restaurants and bars, toward decorating with   kitsch, including images of Stalin. At least he writes, “To the best of my knowledge, there is no   restaurant in New York nor is there a Gestapo or SS bar. ” Late in this book, Mr. Singer reports that one of his daughters once asked him, during a car ride, “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?” Mr. Singer finds moral behavior to be its own kind of cleverness, and certainly  .",,948,19.346938775510203,49,0.2848101265822785,0,0,0,0,76.20678758653442,4.749157445001725,86.82920565033939,33.03465943339361,0.8322784810126582,0.012658227848101266,0.052742616033755275,0.03375527426160337,0.04430379746835443,0.02531645569620253,0.20042194092827004,0.007383966244725738,0,0.016877637130801686,0.06329113924050633,0.0010548523206751054,0.07489451476793249,0.0189873417721519,0.0031645569620253164,0.023206751054852322,0.010548523206751054,0.11919831223628692,0.00949367088607595,0.06118143459915612,0.028481012658227847,0.05063291139240506,0,0.002109704641350211,0.027426160337552744,0.02109704641350211,0.07067510548523206,0,0.004219409282700422,0.0010548523206751054,0.008438818565400843,0,0.006329113924050633,0.023206751054852322,0,0,0.5031645569620253,0.002109704641350211,0.005274261603375527,0,0.006329113924050633,0.05907172995780591,0.002109704641350211,0.010548523206751054,0.024261603375527425,0.012658227848101266,0.020042194092827006,0.04430379746835443,0.013713080168776372,0.011603375527426161,0.012658227848101266,0.020042194092827006,0.002109704641350211,0,0.020042194092827006,0.23839662447257384,0.0031645569620253164,0.0031645569620253164,0.016877637130801686,0.04852320675105485,0.06856540084388185,0.08860759493670886,0.024261603375527425,0.028481012658227847,0.14662447257383968,0.14767932489451477,0.02531645569620253,0.00949367088607595,0.04852320675105485,0.11392405063291139,0.013713080168776372,0.007383966244725738,0.004219409282700422,0.0010548523206751054,0.010548523206751054,0,0.0031645569620253164,0.04113924050632911,0.12974683544303797,0.07278481012658228,0,0.03375527426160337,0.012658227848101266,0.03164556962025317,0.12552742616033755,0.1371308016877637,0.022151898734177215,0.03059071729957806,0.006329113924050633,61.65,0,77.4,0,5,21,12,71,0,53.35,13.275,23.289843750000003,24.55,0,61.65,1,118.96484375,33,169.75,315.36484375,118.96484375,,0.663224485435888,0,0.7120190828499524,0,0.13772226013087463,0.40149162409079436,0.2771045696411061,0.6940035534019229,0,0.6302053091769106,0.2977795959448644,0.42659457855703303,0.43953130849443134,0,0.4975527492057225,0.030955006828393312,0.10061601914066552,0.027910166793641184,0.14356820646123003,0.2667237996943361,-0.6964398005476647,0.7332762003056639,81
71,"Donald J. Trump has had a rough week, overseeing a   of his campaign staff and reporting a dismal   total. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tried to refocus his campaign on Wednesday with a speech attacking his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. But he took liberties with the truth, delivering a series of inaccurate and misleading statements. Some of the highlights, and our fact checks: • Mr. Trump began his speech by lamenting America’s crumbling infrastructure and weak economy. Taking a jab at his opponent, he said: “I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me. ” • Mr. Trump called Mrs. Clinton a “  liar,” singling out her statements about her email server and her “phony landing in Bosnia,” a reference to comments Mrs. Clinton made in her 2008 campaign about a 1996 trip to Bosnia as first lady. “We had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire,” she said. Fact Check: Footage later emerged of Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her daughter, Chelsea, walking calmly on the tarmac in a serene scene. She later said she “misspoke. ” •  Mr. Trump assailed Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, warning that she does not have the temperament or the judgment to be president. He also accused her of running the State Department like a “hedge fund” and suggesting that she had something to hide in the “secret speeches” she made to Wall Street banks. • Mr. Trump defended his business record, recalling that he began his career in Brooklyn with a small loan and built a business worth more than $10 billion. “I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs,” he said. “That is a talent our country desperately needs. ” Fact Check: This substantially understates the financial assistance that Mr. Trump received from his father, Fred, a major real estate developer in New York City. The   “loan” was for $1 million, a handsome sum that is by no means “small. ” But the elder Mr. Trump did not stop there: He handed his son control of a large company with significant property holdings across the city, whose substantial value is difficult to quantify or overstate. Without this leg up, it’s unclear whether Mr. Trump could have built the business empire that he has. • Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton “has spent her entire life making money for special interests  —   and I will tell you, she has made plenty of money for them, and she has been taking plenty of money out for herself. ” Fact Check: This assertion is mostly false. Early in her career, Mrs. Clinton worked for the Children’s Defense Fund and as a lawyer for the House impeachment inquiry against President Richard Nixon, and later worked at the private Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, focusing on intellectual property and other cases. Much of her career has been devoted to government service, as first lady, United States senator and secretary of state. But Mrs. Clinton did receive millions of dollars in paid speeches to banks and others and has served on the boards of corporations like Walmart. Mr. Trump argues that she also made money for big donors through her activities at the State Department and her family foundation, but he has not offered clear, convincing proof. • Turning to trade, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and cited China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization as evidence that his opponent will support deals that harm American workers. He also said that her record as secretary of state should be scorned because America’s trade deficit with China soared under her tenure. Fact Check: As first lady, Mrs. Clinton privately expressed skepticism about Nafta, the trade pact that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993, though she made statements supportive of it. The trade pact has been widely blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs. Mrs. Clinton has called for parts of Nafta to be renegotiated and has said that the   Partnership, President Obama’s   pact that she supported while serving as secretary of state, doesn’t meet her “high bar” on protecting American workers and the environment. • Mr. Trump directly blamed Mrs. Clinton for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, calling her a liar who ignored his requests for help. “Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,” Mr. Trump said, calling the rise of the Islamic State and chaos in the Middle East the fault of the former secretary of state. • Mr. Trump changed his tone on Muslims, whom he has previously accused of being generally complicit in the violence carried out Islamic terrorists. “ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality  —   and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety,” he said. • Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton was responsible for making Iran the “dominant power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. ” Fact Check: Iran is certainly a dominant power in the Middle East, but so is Saudi Arabia, and so is Israel. But Tehran is farther from nuclear weapons than it was a year ago, when Mr. Trump began his campaign. It has given up 98 percent of its nuclear fuel in the past year, and partly dismantled many of its nuclear facilities, under an accord that had its roots in Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary of state. • Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,” which Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to, is a   conservative author who is a senior    at Breitbart News and is affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution. • Mr. Trump laid out six bullet points from the book to argue that Mrs. Clinton is the “most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. ” He accused her of taking millions of dollars from foreign regimes that support Shariah law and abuse women. • Mr. Trump tied the recent Orlando shootings to his immigration plans, saying, “I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. ” Fact Check: Mr. Trump has proposed temporarily barring all noncitizen Muslims from entering the United States he has never made distinctions about Muslims who “share our values,” and it would be impossible to verify that immigrants “love our people. ” His assertion about Mrs. Clinton is based on her support for current United States policy that allows immigration from some countries where women lack equal rights and homosexuality may be punishable by death. • Mr. Trump said that, if elected president, in his first 100 days he would “appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States” and added, “Hillary Clinton’s radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment  —   can’t let that happen. ” Fact Check: Mr. Trump has released the names of several conservative jurists whom he would appoint to the open seat on the Supreme Court if he wins in November and Mr. Obama’s current nominee is not confirmed. Mrs. Clinton has not said whom she would appoint, but the notion that she would nominate judges who would somehow overrule the Second Amendment is a Republican talking point that is not based on statements or past actions by Mrs. Clinton. She does favor new gun control rules, but she has said she would seek them through legislation or executive action. • Mr. Trump lamented that the country has been thinking small and relying too much on other countries: “We lost our sense of purpose, and daring,” he said. “But that’s not who we are. ” If that line sounds familiar, it’s because it is one of Mr. Obama’s favorite lines, usually used to describe a generous, internationalist America. • At one point, Mr. Trump said that the United States is “the highest taxed nation in the world. ” Fact Check: This is inaccurate, according to several organizations that have examined the claim. A thorough check by PolitiFact found about 30 countries that have higher tax rate structures than the United States, including Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium. That has not stopped Mr. Trump from making this claim repeatedly. • Mr. Trump stated that Mrs. Clinton accepted a gift of jewelry from the leaders of Brunei valued at $58, 000. Fact Check: This is a misleading claim that omits key information. Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, may have received this gift but she did not keep it. As required by State Department rules, Mrs. Clinton transferred the jewelry to the United States government. • Mr. Trump concluded on a positive “morning in America” note, promising that he would put Americans back to work, restoring hope for struggling   families and ushering in a new era of wealth. “Americans are going to start believing in the future of our country,” he said.",,1513,23.640625,64,0.3245208195637806,0,0,0,0,83.93206732131054,2.8743822007597615,87.49047034544155,34.976867151354924,0.7924653007270324,0.01255783212161269,0.0403172504957039,0.020489094514210177,0.05551883674818242,0.014540647719762063,0.1969596827495043,0.011235955056179775,0.004626569729015202,0.00991407799074686,0.06543291473892927,0,0.06477197620621282,0.005948446794448116,0.0006609385327164573,0.01784534038334435,0.017184401850627893,0.09980171844018507,0.009253139458030404,0.051553205551883675,0.020489094514210177,0.05750165234633179,0,0.0026437541308658294,0.026437541308658295,0.014540647719762063,0.11434236615994713,0,0.003304692663582287,0.0019828155981493722,0.04230006609385327,0,0.007931262392597489,0.04560475875743556,0.0006609385327164573,0.0006609385327164573,0.43291473892927956,0.0013218770654329147,0.014540647719762063,0.0019828155981493722,0.003304692663582287,0.048909451421017845,0,0.0013218770654329147,0.017184401850627893,0.013218770654329148,0.0039656311962987445,0.04296100462656973,0.023793787177792465,0.013218770654329148,0.00991407799074686,0.024454725710508923,0,0,0.01520158625247852,0.20224719101123595,0.01520158625247852,0,0.01784534038334435,0.07402511566424323,0.0713813615333774,0.06080634500991408,0.029742233972240583,0.07931262392597488,0.12623925974884337,0.10971579643093192,0.013218770654329148,0,0.037012557832121616,0.11103767349636484,0.004626569729015202,0.005287508261731659,0.00991407799074686,0.0013218770654329147,0.0006609385327164573,0,0.0013218770654329147,0.04758757435558493,0.14672835426305353,0.06873760740251157,0,0.01520158625247852,0.0019828155981493722,0.03304692663582287,0.1130204890945142,0.1209517514871117,0.007270323859881031,0.04758757435558493,0.0006609385327164573,40.925,0,174.5,2,64,14,23,30.375,13,112,22,21.75,71.625,3,40.925,3,203.3,40,279.875,509.175,203.3,,0.5335578373313985,0,0.8298574131802294,0.05294214363635836,0.6414298263637128,0.28125389940955065,0.39130894237007,0.4591691824648445,0.2665185772456852,0.7578982763068516,0.38077377899488185,0.37808275878853914,0.6668864784088869,0.07736527373720685,0.6770353111623135,0.07736527373720685,0.10744249342687649,0.02113969373868696,0.14791179462787532,0.26909508898489837,-0.751669565729349,0.7309049110151016,130
72,"The return of Phil Collins has been extraordinarily slow. That’s on purpose. After decades as the drummer and   Gabriel lead singer for Genesis, as well as a commercially dominant solo run as the poster boy for pillowy ’80s pop excess, Mr. Collins retired as a    rock elder in 2011. As with most musician goodbyes, the dormant period didn’t last. (Presciently, Mr. Collins had called his tour in support of the 2002 album “Testify,” his most recent release of original material, the “First Farewell Tour. ”) Since announcing his resurgence last year, Mr. Collins, 65, has performed at a handful of charity events, in addition to starting the process of reissuing eight of his solo albums. On Aug. 29, he will be the musical guest at the opening ceremony for the United States Open tennis tournament in Flushing, Queens  —   the biggest stage he’s graced in some time Leslie Odom Jr. the   “Hamilton” alum, is scheduled to join Mr. Collins in a duet. The gig serves as a   of sorts for a busy fall: In October, a   collection, “The Singles” (including seven American No. 1s) is due out alongside Mr. Collins’s memoir, “Not Dead Yet. ” “It’s like a cartoon character that’s being pulled along with his feet dug in,” Mr. Collins said of his comeback, though he’s often doing both the dragging and the digging in. Over the phone from his home in Miami, he discussed his hesitancy, fueled by both health issues and fatherhood, and how making himself scarce has improved his legacy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How is   treating you? Well, you know, whatever I am doing, I’m doing slowly. I’m just being a little tentative. It’s very dangerous, as my oldest daughter, Joely, told me, to stop doing what you’ve done all your life. I joined Genesis when I was 19. I was drumming from the age of 5. You’re taking away something that makes you tick. When she said that a few years ago, when I first retired, that stayed with me. Then you get out there [to perform] and people like what you do, and you think, “I can do more of this. ” What’s your daily routine like now? I do very little. To be honest, even this week, I’ve still been working on this memoir. Otherwise, it’s just really family stuff. When I first moved [to Miami] I couldn’t wait to be back with my kids. I was taking them to school, getting up at 6:30, picking them up later. The day revolved around that. But I had back surgery last year, which was necessary because my back was [expletive] after all the years playing drums. The surgery left me with a numb right foot  —   they call it drop foot. You have no motor down there. The nerves regenerate over a period of a year and a half or two years. It’s been nine months. I can’t go out and play football with my youngest, and I can’t drive. So that’s kind of limiting. How often are you playing music? Very little, actually. [My son] Nick, who’s 15 now, I listen to him play, I watch his band. I’ve got a grand piano here, and sometimes Nick will say, “How do you play this, Dad?” But without going into the war wounds, my left hand had some neural thing happen to it, which stopped me from playing the drums. That kind of has restricted [piano] as well. I’ve got a little studio here, and at some point, I will turn it on and start fooling around. That day is getting closer. I think about it a lot  —   I’ve got a lot of lyrical ideas  —   but I keep putting it off. What do you make of the critical   of your work in the last few years? I think it’s fantastic. I think, with some critics, I became synonymous with an era of music that they didn’t like, and they were suspicious of all success, which is understandable. You end up painted into a corner that it’s impossible to get out of. I don’t lie awake and think about this, but I withdrew in 2005, and I think I was quite honest about why: I wanted to write myself out of the script. When the reissued albums came out  —   which I was reluctant to do at first, until I found some way I could be proud of it  —   I thought, “This is exactly what I’d hoped for. ” Of course, records sell differently now than when I was making them, so it wasn’t a question of cashing in. It was giving people a chance to   this person that had become a whipping boy for the ’80s. I was so pleased that people were able to say, “I   at this, and it’s better than I thought. ” Is there a part of you that wants to get involved with this new generation, à la Paul McCartney with Kanye West, or Nile Rodgers with Daft Punk? It’s not that I haven’t had the offers. It’s just I’m trying my best not to get busy. Doing the book was an  . I have not really realized just how incessantly I was out there. From tour to tour to tour, one record, one collaboration after the other. It was an incredibly dense 25 years. What gets you out of the house for something like the United States Open? Is it the paycheck? I don’t even know if I’m getting paid for it. I don’t, seriously. If I am, I don’t know what it is. I think my manager put it to me that he’d been asked, assuming I’d say no, and I said, “Actually, why not?” It’s not a big ask. It’s just a couple of songs at the opening of something that I would probably be watching anyway. You’ve said your memoir will be embarrassingly honest. What were some of the harder things to include? With three marriages, you know, and what happened   …     I stress it’s not a   book. I’m not blaming anybody. I was just working so much, and stuff got in the way. There’s a chapter in it about the drinking, which escalated when my third marriage broke up, and I retired. I was left with this huge void. I didn’t want to work because I wanted to be with the kids, but the kids weren’t there anymore, because they moved to Miami, and I was still in Switzerland. You start drinking, and then you start drinking too much. Then it physically hurts you. I came very close to dying at that point. I’m being honest about that. The book is honest, it’s  . I’m not shirking my responsibilities. I apologize when I need to.",,1166,14.21951219512195,82,0.2118353344768439,0,0,0,0,43.001774074981626,70.7299540624199,42.84219554030875,49.72898799313894,0.9013722126929674,0.016295025728987993,0.04030874785591767,0.05917667238421955,0.03687821612349914,0.006003430531732418,0.23241852487135506,0.003430531732418525,0.004288164665523156,0.04631217838765009,0.06260720411663807,0,0.10806174957118353,0.012864493996569469,0.005145797598627788,0.015437392795883362,0.004288164665523156,0.10120068610634649,0.002572898799313894,0.07032590051457976,0.025728987993138937,0.05660377358490566,0,0.002572898799313894,0.03173241852487135,0.010291595197255575,0.057461406518010294,0,0.006003430531732418,0.003430531732418525,0.002572898799313894,0.0008576329331046312,0.007718696397941681,0.05917667238421955,0.0008576329331046312,0.0008576329331046312,0.5566037735849056,0.005145797598627788,0.012006861063464836,0.005145797598627788,0.0711835334476844,0.07204116638078903,0.003430531732418525,0.002572898799313894,0.018867924528301886,0.026586620926243566,0.023156089193825044,0.024013722126929673,0.004288164665523156,0.016295025728987993,0.022298456260720412,0.012006861063464836,0,0.002572898799313894,0.02144082332761578,0.29588336192109777,0.0137221269296741,0.0017152658662092624,0.017152658662092625,0.07032590051457976,0.05317324185248713,0.11320754716981132,0.024871355060034305,0.02058319039451115,0.1346483704974271,0.18524871355060035,0.02144082332761578,0.008576329331046312,0.018867924528301886,0.14665523156089194,0,0.014579759862778732,0.005145797598627788,0.0017152658662092624,0.0017152658662092624,0,0,0.015437392795883362,0.08662092624356775,0.06775300171526587,0,0.02830188679245283,0.006003430531732418,0.06775300171526587,0.17152658662092624,0.1895368782161235,0,0.024013722126929673,0.02058319039451115,84.375,0,22.07375,4.275,3,4,17,12.75,16.625,36.975,19.625,11.9,7.625,10,84.375,1,117.625,21,98.04875,232.04874999999998,117.625,,0.6756923767749301,0,0.35278114020929807,0.09548396906395197,0.06897041102875508,0.08989387552372703,0.29566804505163874,0.23945049902183543,0.29104417188117127,0.4772697400566213,0.3264200832895527,0.2271126143429513,0.1584517208759963,0.19803190560151412,0.19721715043691276,0.02409817782955044,0.08897175690382068,0.015884436939258104,0.07416424696895633,0.17552208267660327,0.40604608399549574,0.8244779173233967,76
73,"JERUSALEM  —   Israeli scientists began their pioneering research to isolate the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana with a   stash seized by the Tel Aviv police. That effort, in the 1960s, helped propel Israel to the vanguard of research into the plant’s medicinal properties and lay the foundations for a medical marijuana industry. Now the nation’s burgeoning pot business, backed by an unlikely coalition of farmers, lawyers, scientists, entrepreneurs and the country’s   health minister, is going mainstream  —   and eyeing markets abroad. Marijuana, or cannabis, is still classified as a dangerous drug in Israel and remains illegal for recreational purposes. But the government is also at the forefront of efforts to develop and expand the   medical marijuana industry and make Israel a major center for it. Recent government efforts to regulate medical marijuana will make it more accessible and available by prescription at pharmacies. The government has also appointed a committee to examine the possibility of Israel becoming one of the few countries to allow exports, although the destination for products remains unclear. The Volcani Center, the Ministry of Agriculture’s research organization, is building a national institute for medical marijuana research. The chief scientist’s office of the Ministry of Economy has infused millions of shekels into innovative marijuana companies, much as government investment helped fuel the Israeli tech boom in the 1990s. The government is also setting standards for the cultivation, storage and use of medical marijuana. “It is almost unprecedented,” said Tamir Gedo, the chief executive of Breath of Life Pharma, an Israeli company permitted to grow medical cannabis and make and distribute products. “It seems the government is working faster than the private industry. ” The reforms spearheaded by the Health Ministry, which is led by Yaakov Litzman of the   United Torah Judaism Party, open up licensing for an unlimited number of growers, up from eight farms. The list of doctors trained and authorized to prescribe marijuana is to be expanded and research encouraged. The reforms, which were approved by the government in the summer, were formulated in cooperation with the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Internal Security and Finance. “I cannot say that I am in favor of cannabis,” Mr. Litzman said at a business conference last month, reflecting concerns that medical marijuana could trickle into the recreational market. But Mr. Litzman said he would even support the idea of export so long as revenues went to the Health Ministry, adding, “There is a lot of pressure on me. ” Some of Israel’s more traditional medical institutions and associations are still averse to joining the party, a wariness that marijuana advocates put down to a lack of knowledge. The police worry about leakage into the recreational black market, and some Israelis are concerned that export, if allowed, would stigmatize the country as one that dealt primarily in arms and drugs. About 25, 000 Israelis, in a population of 8. 5 million, hold permits to use medical marijuana to ease symptoms of cancer, epilepsy and other diseases, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. So far, medical marijuana has been distributed by the growers through special dispensaries or by home delivery. The Health Ministry’s written protocols on the matter, known as the Green Book, have generated international interest. “We wrote this because we couldn’t find it in other countries,” said Dr. Michael Dor, a family physician and senior adviser to the Health Ministry’s medical cannabis unit. “Now everybody is asking about it. ” The ministry has approved dozens of clinical trials, Dr. Dor said, adding, “If we don’t do it right here, the specialists will go abroad with their knowledge, and we have wonderful knowledge here. ” Raphael Mechoulam, now a professor of medicinal chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and his colleague Yechiel Gaoni first isolated the main compounds, including the psychoactive ingredient  —   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  —   with the marijuana supplied by the Tel Aviv police. When administrators at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where Professor Mechoulam was conducting his research, first called the police with the request, he recalled in an interview, “they asked if I was trustworthy. ” Professor Mechoulam, 86, has continued his research in his current post, focusing on the compounds in the brain that make the active components of marijuana work. He is also a consultant for the Ministry of Health and collaborates with research groups around the world. “Medicinal cannabis has to follow medical lines of thought and development and modern medical routes” in order to produce proper drugs, he said. Pointing to an international paucity of clinical trials, he said, “Israel has more than the United States at the moment, which is ridiculous. ” In the United States, medical marijuana programs exist in many states but remain illegal under federal law. Professor Mechoulam is also a member of the advisory board of Breath of Life, whose products, according to Mr. Gedo, the chief executive, are made according to pharmaceutical   protocols. “We are working as a pharmaceutical company, not a cannabis company,” Mr. Gedo said. Breath of Life is participating in a dozen clinical trials, including one based on cannabinoids, the chemical compounds in marijuana, for autism in children with the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. According to Mr. Gedo, several American companies are conducting trials in Israel based on Breath of Life’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. Teva Israel, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. recently announced a distribution and cooperation agreement with Syqe Medical, a Tel Aviv company that developed an inhaler for administering marijuana in precise doses. The dose can be tailored to each patient like a standard medical treatment, which experts say should reduce or eliminate the objections of reluctant physicians. Two international medical marijuana conferences have taken place in Israel this year. At the Cann10 conference in Tel Aviv in September, speakers discussed science, medicine, technology and commerce. Purveyors, some in white lab coats, displayed their wares. A grower called PharmoCann displayed rows of sealed plastic vials containing strains of flowers undergoing testing with names like Blue, Train Wreck and Voodoo Child. Israelis have been producing products with varying degrees of THC for years. Another company at the Cann10 conference, Cannabliss, makes medical marijuana oil and other nonsmoking products, works with a professor of immunotherapy and bone marrow at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem and supplies the hospital’s medical marijuana dispensary. “We hope the market will open up in the world as soon as possible,” Moshe Ihea, Cannabliss’s founder and chief executive, said. “First we have to open up the people. ” He added that he had discovered the medicinal benefits after he suffered a leg injury during an army exercise. Saul Kaye, a pharmacist and the chief executive of iCan:   a venture fund and technology incubator for   driving the global medical marijuana industry, said this “could be another incredible economy for Israel. ” He added, “There’s a national consciousness for cannabis that you cannot ignore. ”",,1153,22.173076923076923,52,0.4293148308759757,0,0,0,0,97.53436445190552,6.264380939834079,67.39276421756907,38.073887517512844,0.7996530789245446,0.010407632263660017,0.026886383347788378,0.022549869904596703,0.02515177797051171,0.017346053772766695,0.1717259323503903,0.0008673026886383347,0.003469210754553339,0.012142237640936688,0.0997398091934085,0,0.05203816131830009,0.06504770164787511,0.009540329575021683,0.02168256721595837,0.0017346053772766695,0.06851691240242845,0.0008673026886383347,0.07892454466608846,0.01647875108412836,0.05290546400693842,0,0,0.017346053772766695,0.010407632263660017,0.09106678230702515,0,0.0008673026886383347,0,0,0,0.006938421509106678,0.028620988725065046,0.0008673026886383347,0.0008673026886383347,0.41457068516912404,0.05637467476149176,0.012142237640936688,0.0017346053772766695,0.003469210754553339,0.027753686036426712,0,0,0.012142237640936688,0.006071118820468344,0.026886383347788378,0.015611448395490026,0.010407632263660017,0.009540329575021683,0.004336513443191674,0.008673026886383347,0,0,0.01821335646140503,0.16825672159583693,0.003469210754553339,0,0.019080659150043366,0.05030355594102342,0.13009540329575023,0.02515177797051171,0.015611448395490026,0.05117085862966175,0.15177797051170858,0.05290546400693842,0.01647875108412836,0,0.026019080659150044,0.10667823070251518,0.010407632263660017,0.006938421509106678,0.005203816131830009,0.0026019080659150044,0.006071118820468344,0,0,0.011274934952298352,0.06331309627059845,0.07285342584562012,0,0.015611448395490026,0.003469210754553339,0.023417172593235037,0.09800520381613183,0.1023417172593235,0.006071118820468344,0.09106678230702515,0.0008673026886383347,29.75,0,25,0,4,9,5,13,1.83,58.5,16,14,29.3,6,29.75,0,83.88,14,94.5,190.38000000000002,83.88,,0.479846209261976,0,0.4366886140478433,0,0.11034777731716484,0.21818694362747423,0.13423167976942957,0.28729897004767463,0.05369870993002891,0.6446349824317932,0.3316128774121265,0.30270904491080425,0.4760432378413863,0.15686671908283387,0.5274800165820659,0,0.06500410731722438,0.010849517196484755,0.0732342410762721,0.147537934561912,-0.3177404310911884,0.852462065438088,53
74,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Reaction to President Trump’s address tended to focus on its sober style. His seriousness of purpose and calls for unity reassured  —   and surprised  —   many listeners. “I think it sounded great, like a utopia,” one voter said, adding, “I don’t think it’s that simple. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump, who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday, faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast examines the president’s speech to Congress, his call for unity and his promise to protect America. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 2. Emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump administration, populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe are cracking on nongovernmental organizations once protected by Washington. Groups that promote open government, aid refugees and often serve as checks on authoritarian governments are being targeted. Organizations funded by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire, are facing particular ire, accused of working to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform “Christian” nations into multicultural stews of   globalism. _____ 3. Developments in Syria this week: Russia mistakenly bombed Syrian fighters being trained by the U. S. another unintended clash among the myriad forces operating on the battlefield. And U. N. investigators released a report detailing war crimes, calling the Syrian government’s bombing of a humanitarian convoy in September, which killed 14 aid workers, “one of the most egregious. ” Next door in Iraq, the battle for Mosul continues. Our reporter met a family fleeing the   portion of the city. _____ 4. Tornadoes lashed the Midwest, killing at least three people and leaving a trail of splintered homes, razed businesses and power outages. The severe weather isn’t over yet. Forecasters said the   and Deep South were also at risk. _____ 5. Snap Inc. is losing money, but its valuation was set at $24 billion on the eve of its arrival on the New York Stock Exchange, one of the biggest market debuts in years. Shares of the Snapchat parent company were priced at $17, higher than expected in an indication of strong demand. _____ 6. Scientists may have found the oldest signs of life on Earth. Or not. Some researchers say ancient rocks in a remote geological outpost in Canada yielded bacteria fossils that could be up to 4. 2 billion years old, relatively soon after the planet’s birth. Others are dubious  —   and vocal. Such battles, an optimist observed, are “how science progresses. ” _____ 7. In a sign that the era of the starchitect may be over, a modest team of three architects won their profession’s highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta set up shop in their hometown in Spain 30 years ago and are not   outside the country. Their major works include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, and the Sant Antoni  —   Joan Oliver Library in Barcelona. The award cited “their intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally. ” _____ 8. Los Angeles votes for mayor next Tuesday. The incumbent, Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, faces some criticism for being “bureaucratic bland” but seems assured of beating 10 challengers for a second term  —   and possibly a bigger role in an embattled national party. We caught up with him at an outdoor cafe downtown, where he sipped green tea, fielded requests for money from a homeless man, and said: “I think people mistake bloody noses for big accomplishments. Maybe because I don’t draw blood, but we actually work well with people, that that is seen as cautious. ” _____ 9. Our tech writer says the sexism scandal at Uber feels like a watershed moment for Silicon Valley. “This could be the start of a deep,   and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women  —   not just at Uber but across the tech business, too,” he writes. _____ 10. Spring is almost here. Here’s a guide to the season’s most promising live events, from Bette Midler’s star turn in “Hello, Dolly!” to Chris Rock’s first standup tour in nearly a decade to The Weeknd’s new North American jaunt. And don’t forget “Groundhog Day,” a new musical based on the hit film, coming to Broadway this spring after a London run. Above, Punxsutawney Phil, aka Raymond J. Lee, in transit. _____ 11. Finally, we’ve been surfing the web for you. And we found lots of great stories that have nothing to do with politics. For instance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s fitness routine,  ’s special scent, the world’s worst skier and a trip to infinity. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

75,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The   defector from North Korea in years said on Wednesday that the days of the country’s leadership were “numbered,” and that its attempts to control outside information were not working because of corruption and discontent. “I am sure that more defections of my colleagues will take place, since North Korea is already on a slippery slope,” the defector, Thae   said during a news conference in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. “The traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling. ” Mr. Thae had been the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until he fled to the South last summer with his family. South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of growing disillusionment among North Korean elites with the country’s leader, Kim  . Since December, Mr. Thae has given a series of interviews to share his dire view of today’s North Korea. Mr. Thae’s diagnosis of Mr. Kim’s rule is hardly new. Defectors from the North, as well as some conservative analysts and policy makers in the South, widely share that view. Still, it signaled a drastic change of roles for Mr. Thae. Before his defection, he was a career diplomat, fluent in English, who had served in Britain, Denmark and Sweden, often delivering passionate speeches glorifying the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades. In the South, Mr. Thae, now affiliated with the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service, has vowed to spend the rest of his life trying to bring down the North Korean government. Mr. Thae said he had high expectations when Mr. Kim took power after the death of his father, Kim   in 2011. Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Mr. Kim was expected to help modernize his impoverished country. Instead, he resorted to a “reign of terror” by executing scores of officials, including his uncle Jang   whom he thought posed a challenge to his power, Mr. Thae said. The former diplomat said he had come up with a detailed plan for his defection, first ensuring that his two sons joined him and his wife in London. (North Korean diplomats are required to leave a child in the North, a measure intended to prevent their defection.) He declined to reveal details of his defection plan and the circumstances. While in London, his sons began asking questions, like why the North Korean government executed people in public without a proper trial, Mr. Thae said. Their English friends taunted them with questions, like why Mr. Kim had smoked a cigarette inside a nursery. The day Mr. Thae broached his plan for defection with his sons, he told them that he wanted to break the “chain of slavery” for them, he recalled. They wanted to know if they would have free access to the internet, books and movies in the South, he said. The best way to force change in the isolated North, he continued, is to disseminate outside information there to help ordinary citizens eventually rebel. South Korean TV dramas and movies smuggled from China are already popular in the North, he said. Another sign of Mr. Kim’s weakening control, Mr. Thae said, is evident at the unofficial markets in North Korea where women trade goods, mostly smuggled from China. The vendors used to be called “grasshoppers” because they would pack and flee whenever they saw the police approaching. Now, they are called “ticks” because they refuse to budge, demanding a right to make a living, Mr. Thae said. Such resistance, even if small in scale, is unprecedented, he added. The spread of outside news and market activities could eventually doom Mr. Kim because his government “can be held in place and maintained only by idolizing Kim   like a god,” Mr. Thae said. “If he tries to introduce a   economy to North Korean society, then there will be no place for Kim   in North Korea, and he knows that. ” But the leader’s efforts to clamp down on information and products from outside North Korea have been unsuccessful because the police accept bribes in exchange for freeing smugglers and people caught watching banned movies and dramas. “Kim  ’s days are numbered,” Mr. Thae said on Wednesday. After months of debriefing by the authorities in South Korea, Mr. Thae used meetings with the country’s politicians and the news media to suggest that North Korea was determined to be recognized as a nuclear power, just as India and Pakistan are. Last year, the North conducted two nuclear tests and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead. “It won’t happen,” Donald J. Trump, then   said at the time. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump had said he was willing to sit down with Mr. Kim and perhaps have a hamburger with him. On Wednesday, Mr. Thae warned against compromising with the North, arguing that sanctions were effective. In recent interviews with local news outlets, he said that North Korea had lost annual income worth tens of millions dollars, after Britain froze accounts last year held by its   insurance company as part of sanctions recommended by the United Nations. Until then, the company had claimed large insurance payments through fabricated documents, he said. Mr. Kim wanted to negotiate a compromise, under which the United States and South Korea would cancel their annual joint military exercises and lift sanctions on the North in return for a moratorium on North Korean missile and nuclear tests, Mr. Thae said. But such a deal would validate Mr. Kim’s argument that he had been forced to develop nuclear weapons as a reaction to American hostility, he said. “That is really a trap Kim   wants,” Mr. Thae said.",,972,23.142857142857142,42,0.30761316872427985,0,0,0,0,95.12356771266624,13.577145583586807,89.88582117471006,11.214545742323521,0.808641975308642,0.0205761316872428,0.03292181069958848,0.026748971193415638,0.043209876543209874,0.01440329218106996,0.18106995884773663,0.0051440329218107,0.00102880658436214,0.012345679012345678,0.07818930041152264,0,0.05452674897119342,0.0102880658436214,0.00102880658436214,0.024691358024691357,0.00205761316872428,0.07407407407407407,0,0.06995884773662552,0.0205761316872428,0.04938271604938271,0,0.00102880658436214,0.01131687242798354,0.01440329218106996,0.11419753086419752,0,0.00823045267489712,0.00102880658436214,0.00205761316872428,0,0.015432098765432098,0.06172839506172839,0.00205761316872428,0.00205761316872428,0.43724279835390945,0.00720164609053498,0.0205761316872428,0.00205761316872428,0.00205761316872428,0.02263374485596708,0.00102880658436214,0.00205761316872428,0.01954732510288066,0.00823045267489712,0.0102880658436214,0.07407407407407407,0.01440329218106996,0.012345679012345678,0.0051440329218107,0.026748971193415638,0,0.00102880658436214,0.00823045267489712,0.1748971193415638,0.00102880658436214,0.00102880658436214,0.026748971193415638,0.0720164609053498,0.06378600823045268,0.05555555555555555,0.015432098765432098,0.07407407407407407,0.15843621399176955,0.07818930041152264,0.00823045267489712,0,0.024691358024691357,0.16666666666666666,0.00205761316872428,0.00823045267489712,0.006172839506172839,0.0051440329218107,0.0051440329218107,0,0.00102880658436214,0.0411522633744856,0.14609053497942387,0.09979423868312758,0,0.01131687242798354,0.012345679012345678,0.053497942386831275,0.12139917695473251,0.11625514403292181,0,0.043209876543209874,0,19,0,59,4,11.875,0,16,56.5,8.25,58.625,17,4,21,0,19,0,76.125,16,171.125,257.25,76.125,,0.39597560825719974,0,0.6705859689320887,0.12127550239018872,0.29064250931503177,0,0.3556918765035309,0.660952036424952,0.22157909974852336,0.6691759309305868,0.36970382825851344,0.12127550239018872,0.42014492065151987,0,0.5324061636606308,0,0.06641221374045801,0.01395856052344602,0.14929116684841875,0.22442748091603054,-0.8225542538602761,0.7755725190839695,83
76,"WASHINGTON  —   Edgar M. Welch, a    father of two from Salisbury, N. C. recently read online that Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in northwest Washington, was harboring young children as sex slaves as part of a   ring led by Hillary Clinton. The articles making those allegations were widespread across the web, appearing on sites including Facebook and Twitter. Apparently concerned, Mr. Welch drove about six hours on Sunday from his home to Comet Ping Pong to see the situation for himself, according to court documents. Not long after arriving at the pizzeria, the police said, he fired from an     rifle. The police arrested him. They found a rifle and a handgun in the restaurant. No one was hurt. In an arraignment on Monday, a heavily tattooed Mr. Welch, wearing a white jumpsuit and shackles, was ordered held. According to the criminal complaint, he told the authorities that he was armed to help rescue children but that he surrendered peacefully after finding no evidence that “children were being harbored in the restaurant. ” He was charged with four counts, including felony assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a gun without a license outside a home or business. Unbeknown to Mr. Welch, what he had been reading online were fake news articles about Comet Ping Pong, which have swollen in number over time. The false articles against the pizzeria began appearing on social networks and websites in late October, not long before the presidential election, with the restaurant identified as being the headquarters for a   ring. The articles were soon exposed as false by publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post and the   website Snopes. But the debunking did not squash the conspiracy theories about Comet Ping Pong  —   instead, it led to the opposite. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with more attacks against the pizzeria as believers in the   conspiracy became more zealous. Within hours of the publication of one of the debunking articles, a post on Twitter by Representative Steven Smith of the 15th District of Georgia  —   not a real lawmaker and not a real district  —   warned that what was fake was the information being peddled by the mainstream media. It was retweeted dozens of times. On YouTube, a    takedown of the Times article was viewed nearly 250, 000 times and passed around on Twitter and Facebook. A surge of new fake articles amplified the original pieces, now linking the   ring  —   known as Pizzagate  —   to a global pedophilia ring reaching Britain. “We should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong,” James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, said in a statement on Sunday. Mr. Alefantis, who has repeatedly refuted the fake news articles, has closed the pizzeria for a few days. He has prominent Democratic friends and previously communicated with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, which he has said may have made him a target. The shooting underscores the stubborn lasting power of fake news and how hard it is to stamp out. Debunking false news articles can sometimes stoke the outrage of the believers, leading fake news purveyors to feed that appetite with more misinformation. Efforts by social media companies to control the spread of these stories are limited, and shutting one online discussion thread down simply pushes the fake news creators to move to another space online. “The reason why it’s so hard to stop fake news is that the facts don’t change people’s minds,” said Leslie Harris, a former president of the Center for Democracy  Technology, a nonprofit that promotes free speech and open internet policies. When users are caught abusing the terms of one media platform, they simply go to another, she said. The viral nature of the misinformation was illustrated again late Sunday, not long after the police arrested Mr. Welch and called Pizzagate a “fictitious online conspiracy theory” in their report. Some individuals on Twitter said Mr. Welch was an actor used by the mainstream media to divert attention from the alleged crimes at Comet Ping Pong. Followers of a shuttered Reddit thread on Pizzagate dissected the episode on a new online network called Voat. The storm of fake news has swept up not only Comet Ping Pong, but its neighboring businesses. Conspiracy theorists have linked symbols that some local businesses on the same street as Comet Ping Pong used in their logos to symbols of pedophilia code. At Terasol, a French restaurant across the street from Comet Ping Pong, the owner, Sabrina Ousmaal, said she received daily phone threats and her business’s Facebook page had been filled with false accusations, including, “You guys mind explaining the pedophilia symbol removed from your website then?” She added that the symbol was not on her restaurant but on the store of a nearby shop and was a swirl within a triangle. Ms. Ousmaal said she and her husband had called the police and the F. B. I. but had received little guidance. “I am appalled and horrified,” Ms. Ousmaal said of the shooting on Sunday. “Nothing has been done. This is not free speech. This is a hate crime. ” Tech companies and government leaders have been struggling to solve the problem of fake news, with Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, earlier promising to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information. In a news briefing on Monday, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said free speech rights pose a challenge for media platforms to prevent misinformation from leading to episodes like the gunman at Comet Ping Pong. “Many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didn’t develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce,” Mr. Earnest said. “If you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform. ” For purveyors of fake news who have continued pushing the Pizzagate theory even after the facts have been debunked, whether Comet Ping Pong is even engaged in a pedophilia ring is beyond the point. Jeffrey Marty, a lawyer from Florida, said in a phone interview that he was the man posing as Representative Steven Smith from Georgia’s fictional 15th District. He said that he was frustrated with the way the mainstream media covered the election and that he believes that most of his 24, 000 followers know that his account is a parody. Mr. Marty, who has tweeted links to fake news stories and repeatedly said the mainstream media needs to investigate Pizzagate, declined to say whether he actually believed the Comet Ping Pong allegations. “I just think you need to investigate. There are clues everywhere,” he said. “But I don’t agree with what happened at the restaurant. ” Mr. Welch has long supported family values, his friends said Monday. He briefly volunteered at the Locke Township Fire Department in Salisbury, according to the chief, Rusty Alexander. Friends described Mr. Welch as a doting father who loved the outdoors. While he had been arrested while driving impaired in 2013 and was sentenced to probation, the shooting on Sunday was out of character, his friends said. “That’s not at all the person I know,” Louis Bodak, whose son Matthew is a good friend of Mr. Welch’s, said about the shooting. Mr. Welch is scheduled to appear in court again on Thursday.",,1265,20.403225806451612,62,0.33992094861660077,0,0,0,0,95.94222430563694,13.232972446583032,77.84237633249491,11.454621465491032,0.7533596837944664,0.008695652173913044,0.045059288537549404,0.023715415019762844,0.04031620553359684,0.02292490118577075,0.14940711462450593,0.008695652173913044,0.0015810276679841897,0.008695652173913044,0.10118577075098814,0.0007905138339920949,0.06403162055335969,0.015019762845849802,0.0007905138339920949,0.014229249011857707,0.005533596837944664,0.07509881422924901,0,0.05612648221343874,0.021343873517786563,0.04110671936758893,0,0,0.021343873517786563,0.0047430830039525695,0.0774703557312253,0,0.003952569169960474,0.003952569169960474,0.007905138339920948,0,0.003952569169960474,0.06403162055335969,0.0071146245059288534,0.0071146245059288534,0.43715415019762843,0.0007905138339920949,0.02292490118577075,0.003952569169960474,0.0047430830039525695,0.03162055335968379,0.007905138339920948,0.011857707509881422,0.019762845849802372,0.012648221343873518,0.01818181818181818,0.03320158102766799,0.009486166007905139,0.016600790513833993,0.013438735177865613,0.025296442687747035,0.006324110671936759,0.0007905138339920949,0.011857707509881422,0.19288537549407114,0.0047430830039525695,0,0.03241106719367589,0.06007905138339921,0.05612648221343874,0.03715415019762846,0.014229249011857707,0.045059288537549404,0.14466403162055336,0.06877470355731226,0.014229249011857707,0.0007905138339920949,0.018972332015810278,0.12648221343873517,0,0.0023715415019762848,0.003952569169960474,0.0007905138339920949,0.005533596837944664,0,0.0007905138339920949,0.02450592885375494,0.11225296442687747,0.06877470355731226,0,0.014229249011857707,0.003952569169960474,0.042687747035573126,0.11462450592885376,0.11462450592885376,0.0007905138339920949,0.0308300395256917,0.0031620553359683794,27.125,0,242,2,17,0,3,104,13.08,125.35,17,3,42,0,27.125,0,110.205,3,344.975,450.17999999999995,110.205,,0.43512342795947073,0,0.8729729369715483,0.053743743888864104,0.3255854608795019,0,0.07850601232327706,0.7470532678336389,0.2708431524315901,0.7806873642135063,0.3255854608795019,0.07850601232327706,0.5439453885890138,0,0.3622293743647147,0,0.0686986497774564,0.0018701143263224827,0.21504756324103283,0.28062935580795173,-0.9041097606534324,0.7193706441920482,111
77,"A traditionally reliable indicator, lurking in a recent opinion poll, suggests Britain will vote on Thursday to remain in the European Union. The main question that polling firms typically ask respondents in any contest is how they intend to vote. In the case of the referendum on “Brexit,” as a possible British exit from the E. U. is known, the polls straightforwardly ask people if they want to remain in the union or leave. After a string of polls showing a sizable lead for “leave,” polls released in the last few days effectively show a tie, or a small lead for remaining. This shift away from “leave” prompted a rally in global markets on Monday. But one of those polls, conducted by Survation, also asked voters which side they expected to win. Asking people to predict a result of an election has, over time, provided more accurate forecasts than asking people their voting intentions, according to a study by Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist and an Upshot contributor, and David Rothschild, of the Microsoft Research and Statistics Center. When Survation asked, “Regardless of how you plan to vote, what do you think the result will be?” just shy of 40 percent of people said the “remain” camp would win. Only 26 percent said that “leave” would prevail. The remaining 34 percent said they did not know what the result would be. Mr. Rothschild said the “don’t know” figure is high for this sort of question. But he noted that undecided voters tend to support the status quo, in part because they are more   and may be less informed. Also notable: Supporters of the leave camp don’t seem to have a high level of confidence that their side will prevail. Some 35 percent of “leave” supporters said they thought “remain” would win. By contrast, only 14 percent of “remain” supporters predicted that “leave” would win. Of course, this is not a guaranteed indicator the Brexit referendum may be a vote that reveals its limitations. All things considered, though, “remain” seems to be in a strong position in these last days before the vote. The surge in the polls for “leave” appears to have been stalled, or even reversed. The betting markets suggest a roughly 75 percent chance of a victory for “remain. ”",,385,16.73913043478261,23,0.3142857142857143,0,0,0,0,94.99835085549371,21.978609625668447,72.48008658008658,69.81539888682745,0.8155844155844156,0.025974025974025976,0.03636363636363636,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.007792207792207792,0.1974025974025974,0,0.0025974025974025974,0.005194805194805195,0.1038961038961039,0,0.07272727272727272,0,0,0.02857142857142857,0.01038961038961039,0.15584415584415584,0.0025974025974025974,0.05714285714285714,0.02077922077922078,0.046753246753246755,0,0,0.025974025974025976,0.023376623376623377,0.05454545454545454,0,0,0,0,0,0.023376623376623377,0.03116883116883117,0,0,0.4597402597402597,0,0.012987012987012988,0,0,0.04155844155844156,0.0025974025974025974,0,0.04155844155844156,0.015584415584415584,0,0.005194805194805195,0.01038961038961039,0.025974025974025976,0.01038961038961039,0.0025974025974025974,0.0025974025974025974,0,0.01818181818181818,0.2597402597402597,0,0,0.023376623376623377,0.05714285714285714,0.025974025974025976,0.03116883116883117,0.025974025974025976,0.03896103896103896,0.14805194805194805,0.07272727272727272,0.04155844155844156,0.0025974025974025974,0.07272727272727272,0.12207792207792208,0,0.01818181818181818,0,0,0.01038961038961039,0,0,0.0025974025974025974,0.08831168831168831,0.06753246753246753,0,0.05194805194805195,0.02077922077922078,0.02857142857142857,0.14545454545454545,0.15844155844155844,0,0.023376623376623377,0.007792207792207792,11.125,0,2,1,0,4,4,0,12,4,0,25,4,0,11.125,1,40.125,8,7,54.125,40.125,,0.34154462287947296,0,0.085296537673365,0.04454817121901355,0,0.1571856809867317,0.1571856809867317,0,0.3587700223871095,0.1571856809867317,0,0.5382408197686036,0.1571856809867317,0,0.085296537673365,0.04454817121901355,0.09573516254100806,0.019087384431852074,0.016701461377870562,0.12913808529674917,0.6859491598454449,0.8708619147032508,20
78,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Behind the scenes of the Olympic matchups and rivalries that draw large crowds here, there is stealth competition taking place in the hallways and hotels of this beach town worth tens of billions of dollars. It is a bidding war that could rival the most ferocious auction on Wall Street. Armies of delegates from four cities  —   led by a series of moguls, bankers, businessmen and government officials  —   have been quietly battling one another here to court the leadership of the International Olympic Committee in hopes of being awarded the 2024 Summer Games. The delegates, representing Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Budapest, have been scoping out the venues, receiving briefings on the massive security operation and taking meetings with just about anyone who can conceivably influence the outcome. But these cities are all seeking to win a contest that for nearly the last three decades has been seemingly cursed. With few exceptions, the Games have cost the host cities billions. Rio is expected to spend at least $12 billion on the Games and to lose at least $4. 6 billion, according to a study by Oxford. The last profitable Olympic Games, at least on paper, took place in 1984 in Los Angeles, and that might have been a historical anomaly. The 1976 Games in Montreal lost over $1 billion. “Hosting the Games has become an increasingly expensive gambit indeed, as the rules for bidding currently stand, the entire structure of the Olympic Games shouts ‘potential host beware,’” according to Robert A. Baade and Victor A. Matheson, sports economists who wrote a paper on the expense of hosting the Olympics. What is it about the Olympics that causes some cities that are typically unwilling to spend a cent on infrastructure or planning to overspend so wildly? And is there a meaningful way to change the business model to rein in costs so that the Games can be both popular and profitable? Those are the questions that the International Olympic Committee and the four cities competing to host the 2024 Games are trying to answer. The Los Angeles delegation of some 25 people here is led by Casey Wasserman, the agency executive and grandson of the Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman, as well as Gene Sykes, a longtime partner at Goldman Sachs, who has been behind some of the largest mergers and acquisitions of the last three decades. The Angelenos are making low cost (about $4. 6 billion) and sustainability the cornerstones of their bid by proposing to use existing facilities like the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, currently home to the Rams football team. According to their marketing material, “L. A. 2024 is about what we have, not what we’re going to build. ” Similarly, the Paris coalition’s bid for the Games is based, in large part, on the infrastructure that the city already has the Parisians estimate their cost would be about $7 billion, which is considered   by Olympics standards. But a bid by Rome, which hopes to follow a similar   model, may already be in jeopardy: The city’s new mayor, Virginia Raggi, has very publicly objected, saying that Rome’s municipal deficit is too vast to consider hosting the Olympics. “Historical data from the Olympics, discounting eventual episodes of corruption, shows us that the costs are not sustainable,” she said in June. “Other cities have already withdrawn their bids for these reasons. And I don’t think they were thinking about corruption or Mafia infiltrations. ” She was probably referring to Boston, which last year ended its effort to host the 2024 Games over anxieties about the cost. On the flip side, the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, who is here, made news when he hinted that the possibility of a Donald J. Trump presidency could make his city’s bid less attractive. “An America that turns inward, like any country that turns inward, isn’t good for world peace, isn’t good for progress, isn’t good for all of us,” he said, in the context of the factors that the International Olympic Committee might weigh. But he also said he didn’t think the outcome of the American presidential election would affect the outcome of the committee’s decision. Whatever analyses have been done of the potential benefits and costs, they haven’t dampened the zeal of the delegates in Rio: The competition to become the host city for 2024 has become so fierce that the committee issued a reprimand. “Three 2024 Candidate Cities have contacted media and invited them to their hospitality houses here in Rio,” the committee said in a statement. “They have all been reminded that this was not permitted and have subsequently stopped their activities. ” Given the continuing concerns about costs and the burden that often falls to taxpayers, a larger question has emerged about whether the modern Olympics should continue to crisscross the globe as the   lottery ticket it has become. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has endorsed the view that the Olympics should be permanently located in Greece, its birthplace. Others have suggested that the Olympics rotate among four of five permanent locations. Then there are more complicated ideas, including having a “distributed” Olympics that would take place at the same time in multiple cities, using existing stadiums and avoiding overwhelming any individual city. But here’s a thought: How about simultaneously granting a city the Olympics twice, once now and again 12 years later? That would allow the host city to enjoy the economic benefits of the Games twice, effectively bringing in double the revenue and amortizing the infrastructure costs over two events. More important, it would force the cities to think long and hard about creating an infrastructure plan for the long term  —   one that works not just for the Olympics but also for residents, who will have to live with what is left behind. And it would allow emerging cities to bid competitively on the Games against more established cities that might already have infrastructure in place. (One downside of the committee’s current focus on lower costs is that potential new entrants could be eliminated from bidding to host the Games because the cost would invariably be so much higher.) An alternative suggestion is that the committee grant a city the Olympics for two consecutive Games, but where’s the fun in that? One of the great joys of the Olympics is the opportunity to be introduced  —   or reintroduced  —   to a city. Building in a   gap would allow the spotlight to rotate among major global destinations, introducing them to younger spectators and making the cities feel fresh again to older ones. Such a plan would also create an even greater incentive for bidders to commit to investing in the Olympics, and would weed out cities and countries that are unwilling to do so. In fairness, hosting the Olympic Games can clearly put a city on the map it is the ultimate marketing tool. Locals can often benefit, too, from infrastructure improvements and increased tourism. But it will always be hard to make the math work for fiscal disciplinarians. There’s got to be a better way.",,1195,22.98076923076923,52,0.31464435146443515,0,0,0,0,92.5300421777527,15.442053529919635,60.890408754425486,54.12069520437721,0.8058577405857741,0.024267782426778243,0.03598326359832636,0.045188284518828455,0.03347280334728033,0.018410041841004185,0.1397489539748954,0.002510460251046025,0.0016736401673640166,0.014225941422594143,0.11297071129707113,0.0008368200836820083,0.08786610878661087,0.0041841004184100415,0,0.023430962343096235,0.007531380753138075,0.10376569037656903,0.002510460251046025,0.05439330543933055,0.021757322175732216,0.04602510460251046,0,0.0016736401673640166,0.02092050209205021,0.01506276150627615,0.08619246861924686,0,0.0008368200836820083,0.002510460251046025,0.0016736401673640166,0,0.014225941422594143,0.026778242677824266,0.0008368200836820083,0.0008368200836820083,0.47782426778242676,0.002510460251046025,0.005857740585774059,0.002510460251046025,0.0008368200836820083,0.049372384937238493,0.0016736401673640166,0.0008368200836820083,0.02092050209205021,0.014225941422594143,0.019246861924686193,0.00502092050209205,0.027615062761506277,0.012552301255230125,0.008368200836820083,0.009205020920502092,0,0.0008368200836820083,0.03430962343096234,0.22761506276150628,0.009205020920502092,0.0016736401673640166,0.0100418410041841,0.0401673640167364,0.08451882845188284,0.019246861924686193,0.024267782426778243,0.03347280334728033,0.13556485355648534,0.06861924686192468,0.02092050209205021,0.0033472803347280333,0.014225941422594143,0.12719665271966527,0,0.016736401673640166,0.00502092050209205,0.0041841004184100415,0.0016736401673640166,0,0.0008368200836820083,0.005857740585774059,0.05439330543933055,0.07866108786610879,0,0.024267782426778243,0.009205020920502092,0.03682008368200837,0.12468619246861924,0.1297071129707113,0.0033472803347280333,0.042677824267782424,0,30,2,16.675,0,20,1,12.9,1,21,37.4,24,28,25,0,30,0,130,15.9,75.075,219.975,130,,0.48193521282732826,0.05839581272817413,0.3408345482063744,0,0.3827822185373187,0.030076064478531474,0.2857204178301093,0.030076064478531474,0.39437337371799364,0.5369780378373759,0.42667401688935513,0.46473776488061547,0.4366886140478433,0,0.3316128774121265,0,0.09730721009000917,0.011901420311008815,0.0561949138269803,0.1646550272273059,0.7066261923525643,0.835344972772694,79

81,"Cars and other vehicles “have turned into deadly weapons” and should be banished from cities to stop attacks like the one in Stockholm from happening in future, according to Aftonbladet editorialist Eva Franchell. [Crackdowns on immigration or extremist ideology are not the way forward when it comes to terror prevention, according to the veteran journalist, writing after Friday’s terror attack in Stockholm left four people dead.  Instead, it is cars  —   which she calls “effective murder machines”  —   that Franchell says “must simply be removed from city centres and places where people gather, if people are to be protected in future”. Vehicles are “easy to steal, and so nothing has been able to stop their advance” writes Ms. Franchell. “It just isn’t reasonable that a big truck can be driven right into one of Stockholm’s busiest streets on a Friday afternoon right before Easter. ” Noting how it is a popular destination for tourists, Franchell says the city centre must be a “safe environment” for visitors to enjoy. She described it as “remarkable” that it is possible to drive around the Swedish capital’s medieval old town. Outlining her vision for a   Stockholm, she argues: “Most problems with regards to mobility and public transport can be solved, and deliveries to shops and restaurants could take place at times when people aren’t out on the streets. ” “Vehicles have been allowed to dominate our cities for decades and it’s the people who need space. It’s vital now that cars be regulated,” the piece concludes. The idea of reducing the number of cars in Swedish cities was backed last month by Sweden’s environment minister, who argued that driving is a gender equality issue as well as a matter of shrinking the nation’s carbon emissions. “Cars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we’re giving a lot of space to men  —   at the expense of women,” Karolina Skog explained.",,328,27.333333333333332,12,0.36585365853658536,0,0,0,0,87.44890848325393,50.24390243902438,72.89186991869919,13.40615058324496,0.8201219512195121,0.018292682926829267,0.036585365853658534,0.036585365853658534,0.057926829268292686,0.009146341463414634,0.18292682926829268,0.021341463414634148,0.006097560975609756,0.03048780487804878,0.06402439024390244,0,0.09451219512195122,0.006097560975609756,0,0.01524390243902439,0.009146341463414634,0.07926829268292683,0.003048780487804878,0.036585365853658534,0.027439024390243903,0.054878048780487805,0,0.006097560975609756,0.021341463414634148,0.021341463414634148,0.08536585365853659,0,0,0,0.018292682926829267,0,0.009146341463414634,0.021341463414634148,0,0,0.45426829268292684,0.003048780487804878,0.009146341463414634,0,0,0.051829268292682924,0.003048780487804878,0.003048780487804878,0.018292682926829267,0.021341463414634148,0.006097560975609756,0.006097560975609756,0.006097560975609756,0.036585365853658534,0.012195121951219513,0.03353658536585366,0,0.003048780487804878,0.009146341463414634,0.21646341463414634,0.012195121951219513,0,0.009146341463414634,0.039634146341463415,0.036585365853658534,0.021341463414634148,0.024390243902439025,0.03353658536585366,0.15853658536585366,0.07317073170731707,0.01524390243902439,0,0.06097560975609756,0.20426829268292682,0.003048780487804878,0.009146341463414634,0.021341463414634148,0,0,0,0,0.012195121951219513,0.08841463414634146,0.11585365853658537,0,0.018292682926829267,0.003048780487804878,0.057926829268292686,0.12804878048780488,0.13719512195121952,0.006097560975609756,0.018292682926829267,0,14,0,50.400000000000006,0,3,0,0,1,4,48.025,30.612500000000004,8,6,0,14,0,63.612500000000004,0,81.4,144.01250000000002,63.612500000000004,,0.47470607699125783,0,0.764888771826562,0,0.16223290110168398,0,0,0.060635704539036266,0.20521309615767264,0.7560975859623325,0.6639816987767779,0.3405424265831667,0.2791745113185196,0,0.24399845080999227,0,0.14556219787763508,0,0.18626469494579673,0.32953862875775863,-0.6188689107119318,0.6704613712422414,35

83,"An African American man in Tennessee was arrested for allegedly posing as a local white business owner and writing hoax letters pretending the businessman was a racist who was planning attacks on local black leaders. [Police in Knoxville, Tennessee, arrested Justin Lamar Coleman after they say he launched a campaign to discredit businessman Jeff McCown, the white owner of McCown Body Shop in Knoxville, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.  Coleman came to the attention of police after it was reported by recipients that he sent letters to several African American leaders in the area, including Daryl Arnold, the pastor of Overcoming Believers Church in East Knoxville. Police said the letters contained racial epithets and threats of bodily harm toward the African American leaders and were signed as if the body shop owner had written them. One of the letters sent to Pastor Arnold’s daughter that was revealed by prosecutors read, “Tell your daddy Daryl to come to my paint and body shop call (sic) Jeff McCown. I wrote this letter (racial slur)   …     I hate (expletive, racial slur). I’m coming to your house to rape you. I’m going to get a chainsaw and cut your legs off and then cut your head off, black nasty (slur). ” The letter went on to threaten to castrate Pastor Arnold. The hoax letter concluded saying, “I am a very racist white man and with Mr. Trump in the White House being the Prisdent (sic) white people going to take over the world. ” It was signed as if the body shop owner had written it. Prosecutors also said there were other such letters allegedly sent by Coleman. Indeed, one was even sent to business owner McCown warning him that someone was going to kill him and burn his house down. Prosecutors say their investigation found that the letter writing campaign began over a confrontation Coleman had with McCown when Coleman drove over the grass in front of the body shop owner’s business back in 2010. A verbal altercation resulted after Coleman destroyed the landscaping with his truck. Coleman tried to charge the businessman with assault and for throwing rocks at his truck during the incident. Police investigated the 2010 accusations, but no proof was found to substantiate Coleman’s claims, and no charges were filed. In 2015 Coleman launched several social media attacks on McCown’s business, but the body shop owner ignored them. When Coleman realized the social media attack had no impact, he began to send the hoax letters to African American leaders, posing as a racist McCown. After pleading guilty, Coleman was placed under house arrest pending a hearing date. Assistant U. S. Attorney Jennifer Kolman opposed the lenient treatment, saying that the suspect posed a danger to the community. U. S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Guyton also ordered Coleman to receive mental health treatment after testimony revealed Coleman had past mental issues.

84,"In the latest twist in one of the most intriguing literary mysteries in recent history, an Italian investigative journalist says financial and real estate records indicate that the Italian translator Anita Raja  —   daughter of a Polish Jewish mother and Neapolitan father  —   is behind the   author Elena Ferrante. In a report released Sunday in The New York Review of Books and in Italian, French and German publications, Claudio Gatti, an investigative journalist for Il Sole 24 Ore, an Italian business daily, reported that records show a dramatic uptick in payments from Ms. Ferrante’s publishing house in Rome, Edizioni   to Ms. Raja since 2014, when Ms. Ferrante’s novels took off around the world. In recent years, Ms. Raja’s name and that of her husband, the novelist Domenico Starnone, have been most often mentioned as possibly being responsible for Ms. Ferrante’s books because of stylistic echoes in Ms. Ferrante’s work, in Mr. Starnone’s novels and in Ms. Raja’s translations of German novels whose   female narrators recall those in Ms. Ferrante’s books. Ms. Ferrante has become an international phenomenon with her four novels set in Naples:“My Brilliant Friend” (2012) “The Story of a New Name” (2013) “Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay” (2014) and “The Story of the Lost Child” (2015). The books trace the lives of two women from their childhoods in poverty in Naples into the middle class against the backdrop of Italian postwar history, exploring the complexities of female friendship. Mr. Gatti writes that financial records he received from an anonymous source show that payments to Ms. Raja from the publishing house increased by almost 50 percent in 2014, and in 2015 by more than 150 percent, “reaching an amount that was about seven times what she received in 2010. ” He said the payments coincided with a period in which Ms. Ferrante was likely to have received large royalty checks and that none of the publisher’s other employees or consultants saw such dramatic increases. Reached by phone, Sandra Ozzola Ferri, one of the owners and founders of Edizioni   said she had no comment on Mr. Gatti’s conclusions. “If someone wants to be left alone, leave her alone,” Ms. Ferri said. “She’s not a member of the Camorra, or Berlusconi. She’s a writer and isn’t doing anyone any harm. ” Ms. Raja could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Gatti reported that she had not returned messages he left for her. Both Ms. Raja and Mr. Starnone have previously denied they wrote the books. Asked why he would want to delve into the identity of Ms. Ferrante, whose readers value her anonymity, Mr. Gatti said, “I understand that a good chunk of readers might be upset. ” He said he was doing his job as an Italian investigative journalist based in New York. “The biggest mystery outside Italy about Italy is who is Elena Ferrante,” Mr. Gatti said. “I’m supposed to provide answers, that’s what I do for a living. ” Beyond the financial records, Mr. Gatti cited literary clues linking Ms. Raja to Ms. Ferrante’s books, including that Nino, the love interest in the Naples novels, is Mr. Starnone’s family nickname. But his primary evidence was financial. “Raja’s work as a translator  —   a notoriously poorly paid occupation  —   can hardly account for her anomalously large income,” Mr. Gatti wrote. Ms. Raja retired last year from her day job as the head of a public library in Rome. Mr. Gatti also said that real estate records showed that in June 2016, Mr. Starnone had purchased an      apartment in Rome at an estimated value of $1. 5 million to $2 million. Ms. Ferrante’s   Neopolitan Novels have found a passionate readership, especially among women  —   Hillary Clinton recently said she was reading them  —   and some look to them as feminist touchstones. They have been released in 40 countries, with 2. 6 million copies in print in   editions. The books’ literary power is derived in part from the author’s anonymity. And Ms. Ferrante’s  fans have said they couldn’t possibly believe her work was written by a man, as some literary critics have speculated. As their success grew, so did curiosity about Ms. Ferrante’s identity, which gave rise to amateur literary sleuthing at a level not seen since the unmasking of Joe Klein as the author of “Primary Colors,” a roman à clef about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Ms. Ferrante, explained her choice of anonymity in a 2014 interview with The New York Times, conducted via email. “What counts most for me is to preserve a creative space that seems full of possibilities, including technical ones,” she wrote. “The structural absence of the author affects the writing in a way that I’d like to continue to explore. ” Ms. Raja, who was born in Naples in 1953, has worked as a consultant to Edizioni   which has published her Italian translations of writing by the German feminist writer Christa Wolf, whose books feature complex women as narrators. Mr. Starnone’s novels often play with the notion of literary doubles and, like Ms. Ferrante’s work, feature   who draw on their Neapolitan roots as material even as they write to escape those roots. This year, an Italian academic speculated that Marcella Marmo, a Neapolitan historian, might be behind the books. (Ms. Marmo denied she was.) Devoted readers have lined up for copies of Ms. Ferrante’s novels signed by Ann Goldstein, the   translator, as if she were a kind of sibyl in contact with the divine. A professor at the University of Padua in Italy recently called on academics to use quantitative analysis to compare Ms. Ferrante’s prose to Mr. Starnone’s. In a deeply reported sidebar, Mr. Gatti discovered that Ms. Raja’s mother had come to Italy from Germany with her parents in 1937 to escape the Nazis. Her extended family perished in the Holocaust. But how Ms. Ferrante’s novels came into being remains a mystery that financial records alone cannot solve definitively. Was Ms. Raja the sole author of Ms. Ferrante’s books? Are they the product of collaboration, including with Mr. Starnone, as literary critics have speculated in the past, even as Ms. Ferrante’s fans have bristled? Mr. Starnone’s name first came up in 2005, when an Italian literary critic, Luigi Galella, spotted similarities between Ms. Ferrante’s first novel, “Troubling Love,” published in Italy in 1992, and Mr. Starnone’s 2000 novel “Via Gemito. ” Both are set in Naples, narrated by the   children of violent painter fathers who beat their seamstress wives, and some descriptions are strikingly similar. Only one of Mr. Starnone’s novels has been translated into English: “First Execution,” published in 2009 by Europa Editions. His latest novel, “Lacci,” or “laces,” published in 2014, tells a story of the dissolution  —   and reconstitution  —   of a marriage, but from multiple perspectives over decades, a technique favored by Ms. Wolf. Its plot echoes that of Ms. Ferrante’s 2002 novel, “The Days of Abandonment,” told from the perspective of a woman who falls apart then pulls herself together after her husband leaves her with two young children. But since last year, literary critics have begun making a strong case for Ms. Raja, because of her years translating the work of Ms. Wolf and other feminist authors writing in German. Ms. Ferrante’s Naples novels are preoccupied with questions of authorial power, as well as with the emotional and personal risks writers face when mining their own families for material. A theme in Ms. Wolf’s work is a fear that writing about someone is a way of killing that person, as Ms. Raja herself explained in an interview in Italy’s daily La Repubblica last year. Ms. Wolf died in 2011. The first Naples novel appeared in 2012. In an essay last year, Rebecca Falkoff, a professor of Italian at New York University, traced the similarities between Ms. Ferrante’s novels and Ms. Wolf’s. “The more I read about Raja,” Ms. Falkoff wrote, “the more convinced I became that she is indeed Ferrante. ”",,1358,23.82456140350877,57,0.3225331369661267,0,0,0,0,95.98019522922961,10.285035926273041,87.76481019506477,26.993961708394696,0.7533136966126657,0.012518409425625921,0.04639175257731959,0.019882179675994108,0.022091310751104567,0.011045655375552283,0.22533136966126657,0.0014727540500736377,0.0022091310751104565,0.03313696612665685,0.07584683357879234,0.0007363770250368188,0.0508100147275405,0.005154639175257732,0.0014727540500736377,0.012518409425625921,0.0022091310751104565,0.06921944035346098,0.0014727540500736377,0.05964653902798233,0.029455081001472753,0.042709867452135494,0,0.0029455081001472753,0.014727540500736377,0.005154639175257732,0.09204712812960236,0,0.009572901325478646,0.0007363770250368188,0.05964653902798233,0,0.0029455081001472753,0.044182621502209134,0.0014727540500736377,0.0014727540500736377,0.4005891016200295,0.0014727540500736377,0.008100147275405008,0.004418262150220913,0.005891016200294551,0.03608247422680412,0.0014727540500736377,0,0.017673048600883652,0.015463917525773196,0.024300441826215022,0.024300441826215022,0.013991163475699559,0.015463917525773196,0.0066273932253313695,0.010309278350515464,0,0.0007363770250368188,0.03313696612665685,0.20618556701030927,0.007363770250368188,0.003681885125184094,0.014727540500736377,0.0861561119293078,0.08836524300441827,0.041237113402061855,0.011045655375552283,0.06480117820324006,0.1568483063328424,0.07731958762886598,0.013991163475699559,0.0014727540500736377,0.03240058910162003,0.12739322533136965,0.0014727540500736377,0.0022091310751104565,0.0029455081001472753,0.003681885125184094,0.005891016200294551,0,0.0007363770250368188,0.026509572901325478,0.14359351988217967,0.07142857142857142,0,0.024300441826215022,0.008836524300441826,0.044182621502209134,0.09499263622974963,0.10088365243004419,0,0.060382916053019146,0,25,0,54.125,3,4,48.65,10,14.75,9,53,12,12,57,0,25,0,98,67.65,111.125,269.775,98,,0.42543136078972155,0,0.615834406868328,0.08160181971423942,0.10592130260593688,0.5903131419012522,0.2284989041564256,0.304036662620456,0.21045795494845548,0.6108532296523559,0.2622154943646779,0.2622154943646779,0.6280030802089659,0,0.5543538247511746,0,0.06274911558963359,0.04331609866978278,0.07115301499895951,0.17273614957340203,-0.35473286698119744,0.827263850426598,66
85,"(Before It's News)I'm about to be seriously un-PC.Hillary Clinton appeared yesterday on El Gordo y la Flaca, a Univision TV show. I would never ask my loyal readers to watch these videos in their entirety. However, it is clear Hillary does not have custody of her eye movements. In the first video you can stop at 7s, 15s, and 31s to witness her whacked out eyes.At the 1:35 mark of the second video, Hillary is introduced by a “little person” who conveniently helps her down the stairs on to the set. Hop up to 4:12, 6:01, 6:10, and 6:21 to see her eyes scramble.

86,"  by BAR   Tens of thousands have demonstrated against the election of Donald Trump. Some are activists, continuing the struggle. Others are Democrats that are just “mad.” “The Black movement against police terror didn’t need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get “mad.” For those who fear Trump’s “fascism,” the threat level “depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration.” None of Them Have Ever Been My President by BAR   “You can’t scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing.” As a revolutionary Black nationalist whose socialism predates my facial hairs, I have no problem saying Donald Trump is not my president. Neither is the current occupant of the White House, nor were any of the Democrats, Republicans and Whigs that preceded him. On a chilly November day in 2009 a newly-created coalition, of which I was a co-founder, marched on the White House to denounce and renounce Barack Obama as a tool of white supremacy and the imperial war machine. “Obama, Obama, you can’t hide – We charge you with genocide,” we shouted, indicting the First Black President for the crimes he was busily committing in service to his masters on Wall Street. The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations had been formed less than two months before, largely to demonstrate that not all Black people were bamboozled by the slick corporate politician from Chicago, elected one year earlier in the nation’s first billion dollar presidential campaign. As the Coalition’s founding press release stated : “Black and Brown people continue to suffer the brunt of un/under-employment and predatory loan scandal crises. Military spending under Obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Venezuela and Colombia. Mass incarceration, police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant...” The Black is Back Coalition warned of the “traps set by Obama’s so-called ‘post-racial’ politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the Bush regime.” To paraphrase Fidel Castro, history has vindicated us. “Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives.” Obama mobilized NATO air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy Libya, which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in Africa. He redeployed these same al Qaida terrorists to Syria, killing 400,000 people, displacing half the surviving population and bringing the U.S. to the very brink of nuclear war with Russia. This so-called “Son of Africa” has effectively occupied most of the continent through a U.S. Military Command (AFRICOM) that was less than a year old when Obama was sworn into office. The African Union provides diplomatic cover for the CIA-run “peace keeping” mission in Somalia, while U.S. conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two African nations. The holdouts, Eritrea and Zimbabwe, are under constant threat of regime change. Obama joined George Bush and Bill Clinton in perpetuating the 20 year-long slaughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed more than six million lives, the worst genocide since World War Two (“Obama, Obama, you can’t hide, We charge you with genocide!”) With the eager assistance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama baldly abetted a Nazi-spearheaded coup against the elected government in Ukraine -- and then blamed Moscow when Russian-speaking Ukrainians resisted, provoking a “New Cold War” that could turn hot in an instant. At the same time, Obama “pivoted” to militarily confront China, whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than the U.S. The jihadist war in Syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism’s last ditch offensive to encircle “Eurasia” in hopes of preserving U.S.-based multinational corporate domination of a “rigged” system of dollar-based world trade. Just as the Black is Back Coalition warned, Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference. He tried to hand off the controls to Hillary Clinton, who got six million votes less than he did, and lost. Back in 2007, when Obama and Clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents -- as cookie-cutter corporate Democrats often do -- we at Black Agenda Report wrote that “ There’s not a dime’s worth of difference ” between the two. Every decent, peace-loving person on Earth should be glad to be rid of both of them. Humanity would probably not survive another year of either one. “Barack Obama was the Black face of imperialism -- a change of color without a difference.” Donald Trump is also a danger to humanity, like every other U.S. chief executive since Truman nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If words mean anything, Trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace, since he claims to want to establish talking, rather than shouting, threatening, nuke-rattling relations with Russia and China, while Clinton’s version of “reset” was an armed confrontation with Russia over the skies of Syria. Of course, all that could quickly change. Trump may be a “party of one” among Republicans in Congress and even in his own cabinet. For those who fear Trump’s “fascism,” the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the Obama administration. These legal, infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent; they were made for the purpose of tracking, disorganizing, neutralizing and locking up dissidents, and disinforming the public at large. Thus, President Obama and his predecessors were fascist- minded , whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not. The Obama administration would not have pushed a bill through Congress allowing the U.S. military to detain American citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it. He would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule. Fascist-minded is all that can be said of Trump, at this point, as well. Black Lives Matter activists have been under FBI surveillance since day one. Ever since Ferguson, the federal government has taken the lead in over-charging “rioters” in rebellious cities. New York City cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than 100 young Black people in separate sweeps in Manhattan and The Bronx. The “fascism” that correctly described Jim Crow rule in the pre-Civil Rights South lives on at the core of the mass Black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the Black Liberation Movement, two generations ago. The current movement against police terror, which ultimately demands Black community control of the police, put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the State. There is no retreat from this response to the demands of Black people “on the street,” who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers. “Obama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule.” The Black movement against police terror didn’t need a Donald Trump waiting in the vestibule of the White House to get “mad.” The movement has already crossed the Rubicon of confrontation with the State. The moment occurred in the second term of the First Black President, when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced. The 21 st century Black movement emerged with the knowledge that Black corporate Democrats are not their allies, nor are Black police chiefs, or Black preachers whose real loyalties are to the Democratic Party and its Wall Street patrons. If the Black movement were afraid of the likes of Donald Trump, it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy Black communities. You can’t scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing. To the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement, it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand, against misleaders like the 32 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who failed to support the Grayson Amendment that would have halted Pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments. These “ Treasonous 32 ”, comprising 80 percent of full-voting Black Democrats in the House, cast their shameful votes in June, 2014, just two months before Michael Brown was shot down in Ferguson, Missouri. (Rep. William “Lacy” Clay, representing Michael Brown’s district, was among the 32.) If the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance, it is these homegrown enemies, who turn Black people’s votes against themselves. Trump or no Trump, the Black movement must continue to press and refine its demands -- or Power will concede nothing. On November 6, after their annual march on the White House, the organizations of the Black is Back Coalition ratified a 19-point document that puts self-determination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting Black America: “Every central demand, every strategy of struggle, must be formulated with the goal of self-determination in mind. Otherwise, the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind Black people even more tightly to structures of outside control.” The points range from “Black Community Control of Police,” to “Halting Gentrification,” to “Nationalization of the Banks.” The points were compiled during Barack Obama’s time in the White House, and they will remain relevant under a President Donald Trump. We’ve been mad. Let’s get organized, and get free.

87,"Goldman Sachs’s outsize influence in Washington is about to get larger. The longtime    at Goldman Sachs, Gary D. Cohn, is expected to be named director of the National Economic Council, which oversees economic policy in the White House. Coming fast on the heels of the nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman partner, as Treasury secretary, it will mean that economic policy under the   Donald J. Trump, will be shaped chiefly by veterans of the Wall Street firm. The position that Mr. Cohn is expected to take up is one that has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital. The role was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Goldman’s   at the time, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin’s   Stephen Friedman, later held the position under President George W. Bush. This time, however, the selection of a Goldman insider is at odds with statements made by Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. He repeatedly attacked the financial elite  —   and Goldman Sachs in particular. In a commercial that ran in the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump warned about “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. ” The face of Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein  —   Mr. Cohn’s longtime friend and collaborator  —   was among the images that flashed ominously on the screen. And Mr. Trump criticized both Hillary Clinton and a primary opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, over their ties to the investment bank. “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Trump said at one primary debate. “They have total, total control” over Mr. Cruz, he said. “Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton. ” Since his election, however, Mr. Trump has stocked his future cabinet with a number of Goldman alumni, including Mr. Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and a former Goldman trader, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is now Mr. Trump’s chief strategist. Unlike those two, Mr. Cohn is a longtime top Goldman executive who was helping to guide the firm before and during the financial crisis. In Mr. Cohn, Mr. Trump is not only turning to yet another Goldman hand  —   and a registered Democrat  —   but he is also choosing a financier whose thinking about the economy has stood in contrast to the  ’s more nationalistic views. At a conference in Florida  soon after the election, Mr. Cohn said the big problem facing the country and the world was a “global growth issue. ” “We’re trying to solve it with domestic policy,” he said. “It’s not going to work. ” While Mr. Trump has criticized companies that have moved their work force overseas, Mr. Cohn has been candid about Goldman’s international outlook: “We have a globalized work force, so when I need to go out and hire the incremental worker, I go out and look around the world and see where that incremental worker is available. ” Mr. Cohn, though, has agreed with Mr. Trump about the need to lighten the regulations that have been imposed on banks like Goldman since the financial crisis. In another interview at the conference, with CNBC, Mr. Cohn said he was “cautiously optimistic” about a Trump administration. “We’re all giving   Trump and his transition team the benefit of the doubt,” Mr. Cohn said. “We’re all waiting to see what happens. ” Mr. Cohn, 56, rose through the ranks of Goldman as a trader and is known for his gruff,   demeanor, which could help explain his rapport with the   Mr. Trump. In recent years, Mr. Cohn has been in line to take over the firm from Mr. Blankfein, and his departure will open the door to a new crop of candidates looking to lead the firm. While he has been registered as a Democrat, Mr. Cohn has donated to both political parties. He has given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees. Yet more important, he has become friends with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and close adviser. The decision follows an extended courtship in which the Goldman executive visited with Mr. Trump three times, most recently on Thursday. Leaving Wall Street to take a top government post could provide a huge financial gain for Mr. Cohn. He would probably have to sell his Goldman holdings to avoid conflicts of interest with his new role, which would normally generate a big tax bill immediately. But tax regulations allow executive branch appointees to roll the proceeds of such a sale into Treasury securities and defer capital gains taxes. Mr. Cohn owned 872, 712 shares in Goldman as of Nov. 14, according to Standard  Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. As of Friday afternoon’s stock price, that stake was worth about $209 million. Goldman Sachs has already been a beneficiary of the coming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has promised to push back on financial regulations passed since the financial crisis, which have come down particularly hard on Goldman. Since the election, shares of banks and other financial institutions have risen sharply Goldman’s is up 34 percent. On Friday, Goldman’s shares edged up slightly. Mr. Cohn grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, the son of a real estate developer and electrical contractor. He later attended Gilmour Academy, a private school in the area, and then American University, though he has often spoken of his struggles with dyslexia. After a brief stint at U. S. Steel in his home state  —   to appease his father, Mr. Cohn said in a speech  —   he turned to the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983, where he eventually turned to trading silver. He was recruited to Goldman seven years later and became a   star at the investment bank, following the ascent of his friend Mr. Blankfein. In 1994, Mr. Cohn joined the vaunted partnership at Goldman, in a class that included a number of financial luminaries: Eric M. Mindich, now a hedge fund mogul J. Michael Evans, formerly a top Goldman executive in China who is now at the Alibaba Group and Mr. Mnuchin himself. By 2006, Mr. Cohn had become   and   operating officer of the firm when Mr. Blankfein took the helm as chief executive.

88,"Reuters provides a sobering account of the danger facing Egyptian Christians, beginning with the plight of civil servant Adel Munir, who found himself Number Two on a list of Christians marked for death by the Islamic State.  Said Sameh Adel Fawzy wasn’t taking any chances and fled the Sinai after ISIS fighters barged into his uncle’s home and shot him and his son dead. “Last Thursday, my cousin went to open the door after he heard someone knocking,” Fawzy recalled. “He found masked terrorists with a pistol who took him inside and shot him in the head. ” “When my aunt heard the sound of his body falling on the floor she came from her room and yelled: ‘What did you do to my son? ’” he continued. “They took her out to the street barefooted and in her pajamas, then went back for her husband and killed him. ” Even worse, some of the families who spoke to Reuters said Muslim neighbors who were not linked to the Islamic State have been emboldened by ISIS rhetoric to attack them and even seize their property after they flee to escape ISIS. The L. A. Times quotes other Christian refugees who thanked Muslim neighbors for hiding them from terrorist attackers and helping them find shelter. “What we are seeing here is new. There has always been violence against Christians but it was usually for a ‘reason’ like land disputes. Now Christians are killed just for being Christians,” said researcher Ishak Ibrahim of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. “Militants are sending the government a message saying they can change part of the country’s demographics. This is a dangerous precedent. ” What Ibrahim means is that ISIS is slaughtering Christians  —   literally going    and murdering Christians who answer a knock on the door, tooling down the streets in pickup trucks flying ISIS flags  —   in order to destabilize the government of President Abdel Fattah  . Sisi made promises to protect religious minorities after ousting Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. The wanton murders and dislocations of Christian families are a significant blow to his authority, especially if   Muslims are joining in. Coptic Christians have been strong supporters of Sisi Muslim Brotherhood activists blame them for colluding with Sisi to overthrow Morsi. The savages of ISIS were correct in thinking they would feel dismay or even betrayal when the government failed to protect them. This is exacerbated by Sisi’s strong promises to restore order after the December bombing of a Cairo church, seen by most analysts as the starting gun for the   rampage. Local observers described a sense of panic to   along with a sense of regional betrayal, as residents of the Sinai complain the Cairo government is not taking all necessary measures to protect them. Sinai residents have long felt alienated from the central government, which is one reason ISIS and its local affiliate Sinai Province have been so successful at recruiting there. Some of the Christians interviewed by the L. A. Times expressed fears that ISIS sympathizers have infiltrated the Egyptian security services, noting that murders have been carried out with impunity very close to security checkpoints, and the Islamic State death squads have been provided with suspiciously detailed hit lists of Christian residents. “The vast majority of the Egyptian population is not impacted by the activity in Sinai, so it is easy for the central government to ignore  —   either because they aren’t able to address the growing violence there or because they don’t want to,” explained Brookings Fellow Sarah Yerkes. One Cairo journalist told   that Copts are even dismayed with the performance of their own church hierarchy because it has taken a “weak and lenient” stance against the violence, including a pronounced refusal to admit local Egyptian Muslims are participating in the attacks. “They are thirsty for the blood of any Christian so there is no way for any Christian to live in  . They were pretty clear when they said, ‘We won’t leave any Christian in peace.’ They want an Islamic state,” Coptic Christian Wafaa Fawzy told CBN.

89,"A month after President Trump’s executive order barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States caused tumult around the country, the government’s accounting of how many travelers the ban affected remains unclear. A total of 746 people were detained and processed in a   period immediately after a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 order, according to a list released by the government on Thursday. The figure was nearly seven times greater than the 109 people that Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 30 message on Twitter had been “held for questioning” and Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, said had been “inconvenienced. ” But, according to lawyers for some of those who were detained, 746 may be an incomplete figure. At a hearing before Judge Carol B. Amon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday, those lawyers challenged the veracity of the government’s list, saying they knew of at least 10 people who had been detained who were not included in the tally. Some detainees were forced to return to the countries from which they had come, despite having valid visas. The lawyers initially asked that the government provide them with a list of names so they could help people return to the United States. Joshua Press, a Justice Department trial lawyer, said at the hearing that a vast majority of those who were held were eventually allowed to enter the country and were legal permanent residents. He said he could not provide a specific number. The Justice Department referred a request for that figure to the Customs and Border Protection agency, which declined to comment because of the continuing litigation. At the hearing, Judge Amon ordered the government to inform the plaintiffs how many of the 746 people on the government’s list had been allowed to enter the country, and to investigate the cases the plaintiffs’ lawyers said had been omitted. The list included only the given name and surname of those who were detained and did not mention nationalities. Judge Amon had not ordered that contact information be included. “All we’re trying to do is put together a puzzle, to which the government has all the pieces,” said Muneer I. Ahmad, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. When Mr. Ahmad questioned why the people he and his colleagues cited were missing from the list, Mr. Press replied, “The government is not omniscient. ” Mr. Trump’s executive order was halted on Feb. 9 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Seattle. The Trump administration has said it plans to issue a revised order next week. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p. m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order. The case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a “snapshot” to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnelly’s ruling, from 9:37 p. m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p. m. on Jan. 29. The list provided by the government did not include refugees because they generally do not arrive on weekends, said Rebecca Heller, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. According to documents submitted to the court by the American Civil Liberties Union, some of those detained described having their phones confiscated, their requests to talk to lawyers denied and, in some cases, being coerced into signing forms that resulted in their deportation. Sara Yarjani, an Iranian citizen who is studying for a master’s degree in holistic health in California, was held for 23 hours at Los Angeles International Airport before being deported, after Judge Donnelly issued her ruling, according to court filings. Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who was born in Saudi Arabia and has a valid work visa, was detained at Kennedy Airport for 10 hours and deported, according to the filings. There is an urgent need to find those on the government’s list of people who were held, said Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer with the A. C. L. U. for detainees. He said he feared that those people might be forgotten once the Trump administration releases new travel restrictions. “We’re going to do our best to get everybody back, and then we’ll fight the new executive order,” Mr. Gelernt said.",,779,16.574468085106382,47,0.33119383825417203,0,0,0,0,96.9336032388664,13.483358449145133,81.90337577628976,27.906161745827983,0.772785622593068,0.007702182284980745,0.025673940949935817,0.023106546854942234,0.008985879332477536,0.012836970474967908,0.1540436456996149,0.0012836970474967907,0.0012836970474967907,0.01668806161745828,0.10783055198973042,0,0.07060333761232349,0.0038510911424903724,0,0.01797175866495507,0.006418485237483954,0.07317073170731707,0.0025673940949935813,0.051347881899871634,0.01668806161745828,0.03080872913992298,0,0,0.012836970474967908,0.005134788189987163,0.10397946084724005,0,0,0.0038510911424903724,0.0038510911424903724,0,0.008985879332477536,0.07702182284980745,0.0025673940949935813,0.0025673940949935813,0.4454428754813864,0.0038510911424903724,0.02053915275994865,0.0025673940949935813,0.0012836970474967907,0.03979460847240052,0.0038510911424903724,0,0.014120667522464698,0.021822849807445442,0.005134788189987163,0.01540436456996149,0.005134788189987163,0.01540436456996149,0.008985879332477536,0.0038510911424903724,0.0038510911424903724,0,0.023106546854942234,0.21566110397946084,0,0,0.025673940949935817,0.06803594351732992,0.06675224646983312,0.029525032092426188,0.005134788189987163,0.08472400513478819,0.14762516046213095,0.0693196405648267,0.01797175866495507,0,0.01540436456996149,0.13222079589216945,0,0.0025673940949935813,0.0012836970474967907,0.0012836970474967907,0.0012836970474967907,0,0,0.011553273427471117,0.10783055198973042,0.06418485237483953,0,0.019255455712451863,0.010269576379974325,0.04621309370988447,0.12708600770218229,0.12836970474967907,0.005134788189987163,0.055198973042362,0.0012836970474967907,6,0,49.375,0,1,0,0,13.75,1,62.45,10.175,2,3,0,6,0,21.175,0,78.575,95.3,21.175,,0.16366871305428174,0,0.6169220736463022,0,0.03158617618052373,0,0,0.3096189991987176,0.03158617618052373,0.6707162431035748,0.24917704576570113,0.06123807571263201,0.08912809699305622,0,0.16366871305428174,0,0.025139498990858367,0,0.09328624005698682,0.11314258577703906,-0.7258519851208021,0.8868574142229609,32
90,"BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF.  —   Like many successful actors, Iwan Rheon, better known as the blithely malicious Ramsay Bolton on “Game of Thrones,” arguably the most hated man on television, admits he’s concerned about being narrowly defined by an indelible character. But ask a logical   question  —   what else are you working on?  —   and the scale of his challenge becomes clear. “I’m playing a young Hitler,” he replied, referring to the British television movie “Adolf the Artist. ” Then realization took hold, and his face crumpled in mock despair: “Oh, I’m typecast already!” Such is life for the man behind a character who, over three seasons on “Game of Thrones,” returning Sunday on HBO, has become the emblem of a disquieting show’s darkest impulses. Since arriving as a   sadist in Season 3, this striving, legitimized former bastard has expanded to both embody the story’s dynastic obsession and inflict some of its most flagrant abuses. That list includes the flaying and gelding of rivals, the recreational hunting of a girl and, most controversial, last season’s   rape of his hostage bride, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner). That he does it all with schoolboy glee makes him that much more viscerally loathsome  —   Mr. Rheon conceived Ramsay as a   of Heath Ledger’s unhinged Joker and Dennis the Menace, he said, and added a bit of the swagger of Liam Gallagher, the dyspeptic former Oasis singer. The resulting confection has landed on many “ ” lists online. In December, readers of The Atlantic voted Ramsay “the actual worst character on television” over the likes of Hannibal Lecter and Walter White, as well as Joffrey Baratheon, the sneering   Ramsay replaced as the signature “Game of Thrones” villain. “After we lost Joffrey, we had a   hole in the ‘Thrones’ world,” Ms. Turner wrote in an email. “But Iwan brings a terror and a creepiness that Joffrey never had. We needed someone to hate, and we love to hate him. ” In the new season, the show’s sixth, Ramsay deepens further, Mr. Rheon suggested, even approaching something like human emotion in mourning a girlfriend killed in the Season 5 finale. “That surprised even me,” he said. Of course, it also finds him seething over last season’s escape of his captives Sansa and Theon (Alfie Allen)  —   the young nobleman he castrated, forced into servitude and renamed Reek  —   and sets up who may be his most appalling victim yet: an      who could be a competing heir. [ “Game of Thrones” has moved past its blueprint. That’s a good thing. ] The show’s creators, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, so obsessed with secrecy this season they’ve declined to offer critics advance screener copies, will say only that Ramsay will be up to “very bad things. ” “Sometimes you just think, ‘Oh God, can’t we just do something nice? ’” Mr. Rheon said, laughing. “On this show, the heroes aren’t necessarily standard heroes, so I guess your villains need to be even worse. ” Mr. Rheon, 30, wears the   mantle easily. By all accounts a charming young Welshman  —   his name is pronounced     and he grew up in Cardiff and now lives in London  —   he is amused by the notoriety and claims it is “an honor” to be considered the most despicable thing on a show full of despicable things. “Apparently I’m scarier than a White Walker. And a giant. And a dragon,” he said. In general, fans don’t hold Ramsay’s actions against him, and the technical realities of production keep the vile deeds from weighing too heavily on his soul. Flayings, for example, involve a piece of rubber and a prop knife he has to hold just so for the light to catch its malevolent angles, making it hard to obsess over the moral dimensions. One exception was Sansa’s rape last season, which “was very difficult to me I couldn’t really sleep the night before,” he said. Like others on the show, however, he remains somewhat perplexed by the outrage it sparked, less by the anger itself than by the scale and selective nature of it. A few episodes later, he noted, the immolation of a little girl drew a comparatively muted response. “I don’t want to compare these things and which is worse,” he said. “But burning a child at the stake? That’s pretty bad, isn’t it?” [ Sign up for our newsletter and get expert TV and movie recommendations twice a week ] For a man known for onscreen villainy, Mr. Rheon could hardly be more   in conversation.   and solicitous, he is given to wisecracks and silly tangents  —   asked his own favorite screen scoundrels, he listed Stringer Bell from “The Wire” and the T. rex from “Jurassic Park. ” Perhaps most jarring for “Thrones” fans: He spends his spare time writing and recording   tunes, mostly on his own but occasionally with his brother, Aled. Last year he released his first album, “Dinard. ” “He’s just a really nice fellow,” said Mr. Allen, the target of Ramsay’s most gruesome depredations. “I couldn’t put a finger on why he makes a good psychopath. ” (The actors, friends off camera, occasionally encounter incredulous fans who are stunned to see them spending time together. “It’s like, do you believe in dragons, too, mate?” Mr. Allen said.) In person, removed from the dank interiors he typically haunts on “Game of Thrones,” Mr. Rheon’s face is more cherubic than demonic, with a rakish scruff and artfully tousled hair that gets more so as he runs his hands through it in conversation. What defines him, though, are a pair of arresting pale blue eyes that tend to bulge maniacally on “Game of Thrones,” alight with the delight that comes from some cruelty or another. “He has this stare, this   smiling gaze that pierces right through you,” Ms. Turner said. Born in Carmarthen, Mr. Rheon and his family moved to Cardiff when he was 5, and he grew up playing in punk bands and dreaming of rock stardom. But participation in the Eisteddfod, a major culture festival in Wales, led to him being cast in a Welsh soap opera, and he went on to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. His breakthrough role came not long after he graduated, as the suicidal Moritz in a 2009 London production of the musical “Spring Awakening. ” The role was one of the first of many troubled, tormented or otherwise odd folks he’d be hired to play. He was an awkward juvenile delinquent in “Misfits,” a skewed superhero series in Britain an erratic drug dealer in the film “Wild Bill” and a traumatized soldier in the BBC war drama “Our Girl. ” (An exception: his gig as the earnest neighbor to Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi on the British sitcom “Vicious. ”) For “Game of Thrones,” Mr. Rheon originally auditioned for the role of the heroic (and theoretically dead) Jon Snow, which instead went to Kit Harington. But his talent and versatility kept him “on our radar,” Mr. Benioff and Mr. Weiss wrote in a joint email he joined the show as Ramsay in Season 3. “The spark of humanity that Iwan occasionally provides makes all the other stuff that much more terrifying. ” Ramsay’s   torture of Theon tested viewers’ patience, but he acquired texture as it became clear that he’s fueled by a toxic cocktail of adoration and resentment toward his father, Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton). The combination of “the little boy and the psychopath” makes Ramsay “more than a cardboard cutout evil baddie,” Mr. McElhatton said. It also situates him firmly within the brutal, multigenerational cycle of legacy and revenge that makes “Game of Thrones” go  —   even if the actor still isn’t sure why he fits in so well. “I’ve been trying to figure out what it is, but it’s so difficult to objectively look at why you get cast as all these strange people,” Mr. Rheon said. “The big eyes, maybe. ” “But,” he added, “I’m not complaining. ”",,1336,19.647058823529413,68,0.3008982035928144,0,0,0,0,88.3207869974337,4.682615900274922,82.52894211576847,10.60359281437126,0.7904191616766467,0.009730538922155689,0.05464071856287425,0.035179640718562874,0.06362275449101797,0.020209580838323353,0.25149700598802394,0.017964071856287425,0.005239520958083832,0.027694610778443114,0.08532934131736528,0,0.048652694610778445,0.012724550898203593,0.005988023952095809,0.011976047904191617,0.0074850299401197605,0.08383233532934131,0.0029940119760479044,0.0748502994011976,0.036676646706586824,0.059880239520958084,0,0.0037425149700598802,0.025449101796407185,0.006736526946107785,0.07784431137724551,0.0007485029940119761,0.0029940119760479044,0.0029940119760479044,0.004491017964071856,0,0.0037425149700598802,0.03817365269461078,0.0037425149700598802,0.0037425149700598802,0.4498502994011976,0.0029940119760479044,0.012724550898203593,0.0014970059880239522,0.008233532934131737,0.04640718562874251,0.005239520958083832,0.0014970059880239522,0.011976047904191617,0.010479041916167664,0.029940119760479042,0.061377245508982034,0.0037425149700598802,0.015718562874251496,0.008233532934131737,0.036676646706586824,0.0014970059880239522,0.0029940119760479044,0.009730538922155689,0.20134730538922155,0.010479041916167664,0.004491017964071856,0.03293413173652695,0.05763473053892216,0.05239520958083832,0.06511976047904192,0.02470059880239521,0.03592814371257485,0.13547904191616766,0.11152694610778444,0.025449101796407185,0.0037425149700598802,0.0688622754491018,0.11526946107784432,0.0029940119760479044,0.009730538922155689,0.006736526946107785,0.002245508982035928,0.016467065868263474,0,0.0014970059880239522,0.04491017964071856,0.12574850299401197,0.061377245508982034,0.0007485029940119761,0.023952095808383235,0.0014970059880239522,0.03817365269461078,0.10479041916167664,0.1092814371257485,0.005988023952095809,0.01122754491017964,0.004491017964071856,73.75,16,163.24,0,3,26.85,0,146.41125,20.83,141.9375,19,45,33.75,0,73.75,11,195.32999999999998,42.849999999999994,427.3325,651.7624999999999,195.32999999999998,,0.6666475164571757,0.3025822873792978,0.8157180010870769,0,0.07522911435049197,0.4213206922685529,0,0.7987981180041517,0.36095404123937547,0.7937642925001103,0.34002540415841787,0.549596989003429,0.4778546047390768,0,0.7198413163204901,0.22974976280943266,0.10508604515100772,0.02305297207147228,0.22990161464953163,0.35064323709995227,-0.8989581549209636,0.6493567629000477,129
91,"The top executive to Google’s parent company, Alphabet, says any restrictions on the   foreign guest worker visa is the “stupidest policy” in the U. S.[In a discussion at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Alphabet’s Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said he opposed all restrictions on the   visa, where currently 1. 8 million foreign workers are in a multitude of U. S. jobs.  “The stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on   visas,” Schmidt said, according to CNBC. “We want the best people in the world, regardless of any form of sex, race, country,   . We want them to work for us and not our competitors. ” “We should organize our country to be the most attractive place for those people,” Schmidt continued. “Stupid government policies that restrict us from [having] a fair chance of getting those people are antithetical to our mission [and] the things we serve. ” Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa. Most recently, that number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced. President of Protect U. S. Workers Sara Blackwell, who is a staunch critic of the   visa, lambasted Schmidt in an interview with Breitbart Texas, saying that while American workers are being laid off and forced to train their replacements, the Alphabet executive is reaping the benefits. “The only stupid thing would be if Americans believed these lies and propaganda,” Blackwell told Breitbart Texas. “The person who benefits from this awful use of   is Eric Schmidt. ” “He wants to continue the termination of American workers and forcing them to train their foreign replacements,” Blackwell continued. “But in the end, guess who wins? Eric Schmidt, who make $108 million every year. ” If Schmidt’s suggestion that the   visa be limitless, there would be no requirements on how much U. S. companies have to pay   foreign guest workers and no restrictions on how many foreign workers can enter the U. S. every year. Blackwell said Schmidt presents a “false dichotomy” of the   where lawmakers must choose between the current system, which has led to   of American workers, or a system where the smartest from around the world cannot enter the U. S. “If you’re worth 10. 1 billion, you can’t talk for American workers who are being hurt by the   system,” Blackwell said. As Breitbart Texas reported, Alphabet has ramped up its lobbying for more immigration and more   foreign guest workers during the first months of President Donald Trump’s administration. Alphabet remains one of the largest opponents in the tech industry to Trump’s “America First” agenda, which is why analysis by Quartz showed it had the largest uptick in   lobbying in the first quarter of 2017. In the current quarter alone, Alphabet lobbied more for immigration than ever before since 2008. In the past, U. S. companies have created affiliates with American universities in order to get around the cap on   visas for private companies, which is set at 85, 000 foreign workers a year. Between 2011 and 2014, companies like Dow Chemical, Samsung, and Monsanto successfully used the   visa loophole to hire more foreign workers by partnering with universities. The   visa has not only been criticized by Trump, but also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has blasted the visa for years in the U. S. Senate as a way for giant corporations to profit off the displacement and firing of Americans.

92,"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla. and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday. Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. She was taken into custody by F. B. I. agents at her home outside San Francisco, where she had been living with her young son. Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016. Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband’s plans to carry out the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif. The Justice Department’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became a central subject of the   investigation into her husband. “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,” said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person. ” The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way  —   either before or after the terrorist attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman said she was “unaware of everything” in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father’s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen “took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized. ” Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an   home in Rodeo, Calif. near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla. where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman’s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen’s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June 2016. “And she doesn’t know anything. ” The Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was “glad to see” that Ms. Salman had been arrested. “Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,” the chief said. “But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime. ” In two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers. In South Carolina, a friend of Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a Charleston church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal authorities in California brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino. The man, who bought the rifles used in the attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F. B. I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime.",,1052,17.83050847457627,59,0.3403041825095057,0,0,0,0,94.32995352767216,13.397145533697028,90.82709286588903,2.6978614914613495,0.811787072243346,0.010456273764258554,0.021863117870722433,0.015209125475285171,0.04847908745247148,0.03802281368821293,0.17110266159695817,0.022813688212927757,0.006653992395437262,0.0076045627376425855,0.08650190114068441,0,0.058935361216730035,0.011406844106463879,0.0009505703422053232,0.011406844106463879,0.0076045627376425855,0.08745247148288973,0,0.06463878326996197,0.011406844106463879,0.03897338403041825,0,0.005703422053231939,0.026615969581749048,0.004752851711026616,0.11406844106463879,0,0.022813688212927757,0.0038022813688212928,0.05988593155893536,0,0.0076045627376425855,0.07699619771863118,0.0076045627376425855,0.0076045627376425855,0.46387832699619774,0.0076045627376425855,0.016159695817490494,0.009505703422053232,0.0028517110266159697,0.0408745247148289,0.0028517110266159697,0.0009505703422053232,0.029467680608365018,0.01806083650190114,0.005703422053231939,0.03517110266159696,0.012357414448669201,0.013307984790874524,0.016159695817490494,0.0370722433460076,0.0028517110266159697,0,0.02376425855513308,0.19866920152091255,0.0019011406844106464,0,0.021863117870722433,0.07984790874524715,0.04752851711026616,0.06178707224334601,0.011406844106463879,0.06463878326996197,0.15779467680608364,0.10266159695817491,0.010456273764258554,0,0.017110266159695818,0.14163498098859315,0.0028517110266159697,0.0019011406844106464,0.004752851711026616,0.0019011406844106464,0.0019011406844106464,0,0.0009505703422053232,0.05228136882129278,0.1758555133079848,0.07984790874524715,0,0.014258555133079848,0.0038022813688212928,0.049429657794676805,0.12262357414448669,0.12642585551330798,0.0028517110266159697,0.019961977186311788,0,3,0,238,0,1,5,0,43,15.83,121,24.75,5,45,16,3,13,81.58,19,386,476.58,81.58,,0.08031885928600001,0,0.8738719082330303,0,0.02828764043650156,0.12706116049625688,0,0.5559065662043057,0.3154572367615121,0.7788807297354672,0.4187737325207174,0.12706116049625688,0.5670996883330294,0.31776845150883704,0.5559065662043057,0.2745446735610874,0.05746770171459164,0.013384240409135098,0.27191141041716566,0.33571901548345284,-0.9261053152034521,0.6642809845165472,109
93,"ITALIAN MAYOR blasted for scathing verbal attack on African Muslim savages who have been invading Southern Italy Yes, his words may be racist and anti-Muslim, but look at the videos below to see what African Muslim illegal alien invaders are bringing to Italy and you won’t be so quick to condemn him. What would you say if they did the same thing in your cities? Thousands of Muslims lift their asses to Allah in front of the Coliseum in Rome to protest the government’s closing of hundreds of illegal mosques UK Express (h/t Brenda K) An Italian mayor has come under fire after saying he will shoot ’niggers and gypsies’ and build a pig farm next to mosques as tensions continue to rise over the illegal alien Muslim invasion of southern Italy. More than 160,000 economic freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have been housed in Italy since the start of 2014, according to date from the interior ministry. Italy has been one of the first destinations along migrants typical routes for months, receiving thousands of new arrivals who continue to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean on rickety smuggler’s boats. But many have been critical of the welcoming of so many refugees – and now one Mayor from the town of Albettone in Vento has launched a scathing attack on the new arrivals. Speaking on La Zanzara on Radio 24, Joe Formaggio said: “Immigrants? If they send them to us, we will protect our houses. We are proud to be racists.” The mayor claims his city “exports brains and imports niggers” who “are less intelligent than us, they are inferior”. Amid possible plans to open a mosque in the city, he claimed he would open a “large farm of pigs if they open a mosque here”. Mr Formaggio added: ”If refugees are sent here to Albettone, the barricades in Gorino will be seen as nothing. “Here we do not want immigrants, niggers or gypsies. They have a lower IQ: history proves it. “We have a shooting range and the highest number of licenses to carry weapons in the whole Veneto region. “And we do not want anyone to come and bother us. They risk their lives around us.” The comments were deemed so strong that the Secretary General of the Vicenza Chamber has been forced to intervene. Calling the comments “irresponsible”, Giampaolo Zanni said: “The Chamber of Vicenza totally rejects the Mayor of Albetton’s statements about the black population. “None of us underestimates the problems arising from illegal alien Muslim invasion migration. “But responses like those of the Mayor of Albettone are not only xenophobic and racist, but are also dangerous as they encourage feelings of racial hatred, and therefore are in stark contrast to the values of our constitution.” Thousands of Italians have come out in large protests against the never-ending Muslim invasion of their country.",,484,22,22,0.32644628099173556,0,0,0,0,90.13249154543453,14.565990483345853,80.7157943067034,2.352744470453349,0.78099173553719,0.008264462809917356,0.045454545454545456,0.028925619834710745,0.05165289256198347,0.028925619834710745,0.1446280991735537,0.01859504132231405,0.006198347107438017,0.012396694214876033,0.0743801652892562,0.004132231404958678,0.07851239669421488,0.010330578512396695,0.004132231404958678,0.010330578512396695,0.008264462809917356,0.07024793388429752,0.008264462809917356,0.028925619834710745,0.026859504132231406,0.05785123966942149,0.004132231404958678,0,0.030991735537190084,0.01859504132231405,0.09090909090909091,0,0,0.004132231404958678,0,0,0.014462809917355372,0.024793388429752067,0.002066115702479339,0.002066115702479339,0.4834710743801653,0.004132231404958678,0.012396694214876033,0.002066115702479339,0,0.02066115702479339,0.012396694214876033,0.002066115702479339,0.006198347107438017,0.010330578512396695,0.006198347107438017,0.014462809917355372,0.002066115702479339,0.026859504132231406,0.014462809917355372,0.03925619834710744,0.002066115702479339,0,0.02066115702479339,0.21694214876033058,0.004132231404958678,0.002066115702479339,0.026859504132231406,0.04132231404958678,0.04132231404958678,0.06818181818181818,0.012396694214876033,0.04132231404958678,0.1652892561983471,0.08884297520661157,0.014462809917355372,0.004132231404958678,0.03925619834710744,0.14049586776859505,0.026859504132231406,0.002066115702479339,0.010330578512396695,0.006198347107438017,0.010330578512396695,0,0,0.012396694214876033,0.10950413223140495,0.08264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.01652892561983471,0.024793388429752067,0.03512396694214876,0.128099173553719,0.128099173553719,0.024793388429752067,0.006198347107438017,0.006198347107438017,14.5,0,123.60000000000002,5,0,0,10.275,88.4,3,81.22500000000001,0,1,12.5,0,14.5,0,29,15.275,199.05,232.04999999999998,29,,0.40872498789703565,0,0.8549126321917284,0.19248405980003652,0,0,0.32878761692824016,0.8082198743294748,0.12512420160141322,0.7947560137109346,0,0.045503819962193694,0.3733998662292084,0,0.422560293516833,0,0.04321585574845392,0.022762834364056333,0.29662469264585356,0.34580135608374934,-0.9197738821167389,0.6541986439162506,45

95,"Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Monday for their work on improving the design of contracts, the deals that bind together employers and their workers, or companies and their customers. Dr. Holmstrom, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a particular influence on executive pay practices. Dr. Hart, a professor at Harvard, has contributed to the debate about the outsourcing of public services like prisons and garbage collection. “Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize, said Monday morning. “Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions. ” The prize committee in recent years has shied away from grand economic theories, instead rewarding economists who develop careful insights about smaller questions. Macroeconomics, the field devoted to those broader questions, has fallen into something of an existential crisis in recent years. There is, for now, greater certainty about the value of work on a smaller scale. “Much of economics from the noneconomist perspective is about how governments run fiscal policy and monetary policy,” said Patrick Bolton, an economist at Columbia University. “This is really thinking about economics from the ground up, from the small to the large. ” Dr. Holmstrom’s work has focused on employment contracts. Companies would like managers to behave as if they owned the place: working hard and minding costs while taking smart risks. Employees, on the other hand, would like to be paid as much as possible while working no harder than necessary. And performance is difficult to assess. Economists since Adam Smith have grappled with the conflicts inherent in the relationship between owners and employees. Dr. Holmstrom’s work, beginning in the late 1970s, presented evidence that companies should tie pay to the broadest possible evaluation of an employee’s performance. In later work, he focused on the benefits of simple contracts that mixed base pay with limited incentives. Dr. Hart’s work begins from the observation that contracts are incomplete instruction manuals. They cannot specify what to do in every case. Instead, they must stipulate how decisions should be made. “His research provides us with theoretical tools for studying questions such as which kinds of companies should merge, the proper mix of debt and equity financing, and which institutions such as schools or prisons ought to be privately or publicly owned,” the academy said in a summary of his work. Dr. Holmstrom, speaking via an audio connection to a news conference hosted by the academy, said he had been “very surprised and very happy” to get the news. Asked how his day was going, he said there was “a sense of things being surreal. ” Dr. Hart said he had hugged his wife, roused his son from sleep and spoken by phone with Dr. Holmstrom, a close friend whom he has known for years. “I woke at about 4:40 and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang,” Dr. Hart said. One implication of Dr. Holmstrom’s work is that it makes sense to withhold some compensation for a time, to evaluate the results of a manager’s work. Companies have turned increasingly to this kind of deferred compensation, particularly for senior executives. But his influence on compensation practices is limited. He has argued, for example, that companies should tie such evaluations to the stock market performance of their industry rather than focusing solely on the company’s own stock price. It makes little sense to reward an executive for gains that reflect a broader change in the industry’s fortunes, or to punish executives for setbacks beyond their control. But such advice has not become common practice. In an influential 1986 paper, Dr. Holmstrom and Dr. Hart  —   writing together for the first time in their careers  —   also underscored important limitations on   pay. The two men observed that contracts are generally much simpler than theory might predict. Companies do not try to write down a complete set of expectations. The reason, they suggested, is that specific instructions can be counterproductive, encouraging too much focus on whatever happens to be easily quantified. Dr. Hart, in his own work, has explored the limits of contractual relationships. Consider the case of an electric company that needs to rewrite its contract with a coal mine because its needs have changed. Under some circumstances, Dr. Hart has shown, the utility would have been better off owning the mine from the beginning, to control the relationship. In other cases, contracts make more sense than ownership. Cities should outsource garbage collection, for example, Dr. Hart said in an interview on Monday. There is always a balance, he said, between saving money and losing control. The critical issue, he said, is often the extent to which a contract can account for unexpected challenges. “A government wouldn’t contract with a private company to carry out its foreign policy because it’s just too difficult to specify in a contract how to carry out foreign policy,” he said. “That would be crazy. ” The federal government turned to Dr. Hart in a pair of recent tax cases. Two companies  —   Black  Decker and Wells Fargo  —   claimed tax benefits related to spinning off some lines of business. The government leaned on Dr. Hart’s theory, arguing that companies retained control of   and therefore they could not simultaneously lay claim to the cost savings. Dr. Holmstrom, 67, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and speaks Swedish well enough to answer questions in that language at Monday’s news conference. In the early 1970s, he was working for a Finnish company that wanted to use computers to improve productivity. Dr. Holmstrom, sent to Stanford on a   fellowship, concluded that the real challenge was not programming but providing employees with proper incentives. He stayed to earn a Ph. D. and has been a professor at M. I. T. since 1994. Dr. Hart, 68, was born in London and came to the United States to earn his Ph. D. in 1974 from Princeton. He has been a professor of economics at Harvard since 1993. “He will not let go until he’s understood what you have to say,” Dr. Bolton said. “And most of the time, your argument fails. Which is an unpleasant experience as a student. But when you succeed, it gives you an incredible confidence. ” ■ Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct. 3 for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for “ . ” ■ David J.

Last year’s winner was Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarussian journalist and writer known for deeply researched works about female Russian soldiers in World War II and the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",,1287,16.714285714285715,77,0.36363636363636365,0,0,0,0,95.0644219512144,12.915354486783057,68.76823176823177,78.45445404268933,0.8088578088578089,0.04351204351204351,0.04351204351204351,0.030303030303030304,0.052059052059052056,0.010878010878010878,0.18104118104118105,0.005439005439005439,0.000777000777000777,0.012432012432012432,0.08003108003108003,0,0.06526806526806526,0.020202020202020204,0.001554001554001554,0.022533022533022532,0.006993006993006993,0.10178710178710179,0.001554001554001554,0.06371406371406371,0.022533022533022532,0.048174048174048176,0,0.002331002331002331,0.023310023310023312,0.014763014763014764,0.1250971250971251,0,0.001554001554001554,0.002331002331002331,0.001554001554001554,0,0.005439005439005439,0.04195804195804196,0.000777000777000777,0.000777000777000777,0.439005439005439,0.017871017871017872,0.01554001554001554,0,0.003108003108003108,0.03341103341103341,0.000777000777000777,0,0.024087024087024088,0.01320901320901321,0,0.019425019425019424,0.028749028749028748,0.011655011655011656,0.006216006216006216,0.011655011655011656,0,0.000777000777000777,0.010878010878010878,0.1926961926961927,0.006216006216006216,0,0.022533022533022532,0.07692307692307693,0.12276612276612277,0.035742035742035744,0.04040404040404041,0.0644910644910645,0.16083916083916083,0.06915306915306915,0.008547008547008548,0,0.020202020202020204,0.12432012432012432,0,0.022533022533022532,0.006216006216006216,0.001554001554001554,0.000777000777000777,0,0,0.017871017871017872,0.0777000777000777,0.07148407148407149,0,0.022533022533022532,0.010878010878010878,0.041181041181041184,0.11188811188811189,0.11732711732711733,0.000777000777000777,0.10722610722610723,0.003108003108003108,119,0,45.45,0,17.965625,27.75,15,16,26,41,24,36.375,46,0,119,18.25,256.340625,62,117.45,431.790625,256.340625,,0.7520087778192724,0,0.5366451681042296,0,0.31403791319446167,0.41422340943822894,0.2765342251790551,0.28963032698688057,0.3985112005302388,0.5109490541235189,0.3794896366978548,0.48103731885171874,0.5396348054304346,0,0.5075738695855055,0.317430865946019,0.15973462270194902,0.03863432340278034,0.07318711747833148,0.2690635265893331,0.8334796129227988,0.7309364734106669,114
96,"“Brexit means Clusterfuck” confirms Prime Minister Theresa May has clarified that Brexit actually means one giant, steaming clusterfuck. The reincarnation of Emperor Palpatine made the statement following the High Court ruling that Parliament would have to give the go-ahead for Britain to officially tell the EU to piss right off. “Brexit does indeed mean clusterfuck,” said the Prime Minister, giving the pained smile of a woman who knows she’s going to be the historical equivalent of Basil Fawlty. “But it is the clusterfuck that the people voted for, and by God, we shall see to it that this clusterfuck gets done right and proper. “I mean, I’d rather not, because it’s going to be dreadful and tedious, but that’s democracy for you.” Brexiter, Simon Williams, said,”If ‘clusterfuck’ means ‘taking back control’ then I say bring on the clusterfuck and damn the consequences. “We’ve already told the experts where to go; there is no going back. Brexit means clusterfuck, and I demand to be clusterfucked immediately.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

97,"Three people have been critically injured and several others less severely after a car mounted the pavement in Helsinki, Finland. [The incident, which police say was not deliberate, took place outside a subway station in the eastern part of Finland’s capital. Witnesses saw an   Silver Volvo estate driving at speed before mounting the pavement and hitting several other cars before coming to a stop, reports Finnish newspaper Ilta Sanomat.  A police spokesman told the newspaper “there is nothing presently to suggest the act was intentional” and that the driver had been taken into custody. Approximately 10 emergency appliances including fire engines and ambulances attended the scene. An eyewitness told media some of those injured appeared to be in very bad condition. The crash comes amid heightened concern in Europe over vehicles being used as an attack vector by Islamist killers. 2016 saw the Islamist attacks at the Berlin Christmas market in December and the national day attacks in Nice, France in July. Between the two attacks, 99 were killed. 2016 has also seen the trial of Bosnian Muslim Alen Rizvanović, who drove his car through the central shopping district of Graz, Austria in 2015, killing four. Despite evidence to the contrary, the incident was widely reported as a traffic accident in Austrian media.

99,"When Donald J. Trump said last fall that he would consider making Muslims in the United States carry special identification cards, Tayyib Rashid reached into his wallet and pulled out his military ID, then posted a picture of it online, adding: “Hey @realDonaldTrump, I’m an American Muslim and I already carry a special ID badge. Where’s yours?” Now, Mr. Rashid, who served five years in the Marine Corps and worked in avionics, deploying three times, has been outraged again by Mr. Trump. This time it is because of the Republican presidential candidate’s disparaging comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed by a car bomb in Iraq in 2004, who criticized Mr. Trump’s proposed policies toward Muslims at the Democratic National Convention. The episode “brought tears to my eyes,” Mr. Rashid said. “These are people who sacrificed their own child, their own blood. ” But, he said, his anger is tempered by his own experience in the military, where people were overwhelmingly accepting and supportive. “I experienced nothing but love and camaraderie from all the Marines I served with,” said Mr. Rashid, who joined the Marines in 1997. “I was often the first Muslim many of them had ever met, but there was no racism, no bigotry. It doesn’t really matter your faith: We were all Marines first. ” Still, as Mr. Rashid acknowledges, Muslims in the military face numerous challenges. For one, 15 years of war in Muslim countries has made serving in the military a cultural minefield. Among some   soldiers, Islam itself, not extremism, is often seen as the problem. In interviews, Muslim soldiers said they had all encountered at one time or another what one called “knucklehead” comments equating them with terrorists. Things got worse after 13 people were killed at Fort Hood in 2009 by a Muslim Army psychiatrist who said the United States’ wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were wars against all Muslims. Other problems come from the cultural barriers, like a ban on facial hair, and dealing with military food that is often rife with pork, forbidden by Islam. Few bases have Muslim prayer services, and only five of the Army’s roughly 2, 900 chaplains are imams. “It can be challenging,” said Mr. Rashid, whose family moved from Pakistan when he was 10. “The nature of military service is not very conducive to practicing your faith, but Islam is flexible. ” “I am here as an American,” he added. “I benefit from the liberty and opportunity of this country, and it is my obligation to serve this nation in some way. ” Thousands of Muslims have served in the military since at least the Civil War, but they make up a disproportionately small portion of the force. Just 3, 939 troops currently list their faith as Islam, according to Pentagon data. They make up just 0. 3 percent of the military Muslims are estimated to make up about 1 percent of the civilian population. Their numbers are so few that some go most of their career without meeting another Muslim in uniform. In Europe, some countries have made moves to encourage Muslims to enlist. The British Army, which has similarly low participation among Muslims, two years ago launched a recruiting initiative, the Armed Forces Muslim Forum. The armed forces allow fasting during Ramadan and make accommodations for daily prayers, setting up prayer rooms on bases and recently adding one to a warship. The Pentagon does not track how many Muslim troops have died in combat since 2001, but they have served in all branches  —   as officers, combat troops, interpreters and intelligence gatherers. Some say that life in the military became harder after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “After   I really started noticing a change,” said Mansoor Shams, who was born in Pakistan and served in the Marine Corps from 2000 to 2004. “A few guys made negative comments, sometimes   calling me the Taliban. I decided to nip it in the bud, and most of the guys understood. ” Some troops also find it difficult to fight in countries their families may be from. But when it comes to religious liberty, they say, the military has gone to considerable lengths to be accommodating. Troops have time to pray and can fast during Ramadan. The military even makes halal versions of M. R. E.s  —   meals ready to eat, its   field rations  —   along with kosher and vegetarian versions. “The halal M. R. E.s are actually pretty good, maybe even better than regular M. R. E. s,” said Capt. Nadi Kassim, a company commander in the Army’s Second Cavalry Regiment. Captain Kassim, a child of Palestinian refugees who graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2010, has felt nothing but support from the military since he was a cadet, he said. “I was never singled out for being a guy named Nadi Kassim,” he said. “The Army minimizes differences and rewards achievement, and I really thrived in that. ” When a recent field exercise fell during Ramadan, Captain Kassim said, the support unit doing the cooking set aside meals so he and another Muslim could eat after sunset. “We did not ask them to,” he said. “They just did it on their own to show they supported us. ” Though easy to overlook, Muslim culture has a firm toehold in the military, said Cmdr. Abuhena Saifulislam, a chaplain who serves as an imam in the Navy and Marine Corps, a job he has held for 20 years. Every Friday, he said, an imam holds prayers in the Pentagon, and at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where he is stationed, he leads prayers daily. Commander Saifulislam has been invited to lead prayers at the White House by President George W. Bush and President Obama. On his latest visit, during the Muslim holiday Eid   he walked into the White House with a    Muslim who had fought in World War II. “Many times I have been to Afghanistan,” he said. “I let them know there how we as Muslims live in America. And I have made great relationships. ” Commander Saifulislam oversaw the building of a mosque at Camp Lejeune, complete with separate entrances for men and women. And in his long career in the military, he said, he has ministered to many more Christians than Muslims and has never faced a backlash. “When I was young, I came here from Bangladesh without a family,” he said. “And in many ways the military became my family. I wouldn’t have stayed 20 years unless I felt welcome. ”",,1093,15.614285714285714,70,0.3110704483074108,0,0,0,0,86.10255834701914,26.324255362407236,74.50765870790661,35.35088611026397,0.8334858188472095,0.011893870082342177,0.04025617566331199,0.03751143641354071,0.04574565416285453,0.021043000914913082,0.19945105215004574,0.011893870082342177,0.0018298261665141812,0.008234217749313814,0.07227813357731015,0,0.06312900274473925,0.021043000914913082,0.010064043915827997,0.022872827081427266,0.010978956999085087,0.08966148215919488,0.0018298261665141812,0.07593778591033852,0.023787740164684355,0.053979871912168347,0,0.007319304666056725,0.024702653247941447,0.004574565416285453,0.10064043915827996,0,0.004574565416285453,0.0036596523330283625,0.0009149130832570906,0,0.008234217749313814,0.06495882891125343,0.0036596523330283625,0.0036596523330283625,0.45288197621225984,0.008234217749313814,0.018298261665141813,0.006404391582799634,0.021957913998170174,0.03385178408051235,0.0036596523330283625,0.007319304666056725,0.012808783165599268,0.020128087831655993,0.007319304666056725,0.03202195791399817,0,0.020128087831655993,0.013723696248856358,0.020128087831655993,0.0027447392497712718,0,0.03019213174748399,0.24611161939615736,0.0036596523330283625,0,0.0292772186642269,0.07044830741079597,0.08691674290942361,0.06678865507776761,0.025617566331198535,0.059469350411710885,0.13906678865507777,0.10064043915827996,0.0292772186642269,0.0009149130832570906,0.0384263494967978,0.13906678865507777,0.04666056724611162,0.010064043915827997,0.0036596523330283625,0.0027447392497712718,0.0054894784995425435,0,0,0.021957913998170174,0.11985361390667887,0.07044830741079597,0,0.01463860933211345,0.01646843549862763,0.05032021957913998,0.1344922232387923,0.13266239707227814,0.0036596523330283625,0.022872827081427266,0.0027447392497712718,22.84375,0,112.2,0,4,0,32,28,11,67,10.84375,16,37,0,22.84375,0,90.84375,36,159.2,279.04375,90.84375,,0.3790844212875113,0,0.749916918289978,0,0.09657969325936246,0,0.4609850100203756,0.4280260848972461,0.2271949277131615,0.6416605862290253,0.22469285597249633,0.2995325016467051,0.49720106794704233,0,0.3806902399058628,0,0.07020145184426724,0.027819770390297854,0.12302520683709495,0.21563702927354658,-0.7209528211661583,0.7843629707264534,78
100,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump had already given his blessing: Pull the bill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, bound for the basement of the Capitol, was preparing to deliver the news to his conference. And inside the House gallery on Friday, still teeming with lawmakers debating legislation that would never get a vote, Gary and Tammy Comes, visitors from Vero Beach, Fla. were straining to puzzle out the shouting just after 3:30 p. m. “Vote! Vote! Vote!” came the lawmakers’ chants, echoing as the body suddenly adjourned, setting in motion a whirring of members, journalists and assorted guests wandering through the Capitol, conscripted to spend the next several minutes  —   days? election cycles?  —   making sense of what had happened. “He’s like the coach,” Mr. Comes, a    Trump voter, said of his president as he left, lamenting the finale of a   education in legislative incineration. “Why do you want the coach to lose?” They were not alone in this hour of congressional processing, shuffling toward the exits with more questions than insights. Republican members fumed loudest, racing into elevators after their conference meeting. “Don’t bother to go,” Representative Darrell Issa of California told a   colleague. It was over, he said, turning a thumb down. Staff members digested the moment in varying degrees of distress. “Health care is hard,” one young woman said quietly to a peer. Building employees gossiped. “Ryan did an interview downstairs,” one man told a police officer on his way out, referring to Mr. Ryan’s session with reporters after 4 p. m. “Said Obamacare’s the law of the land. ” Others drifted through the halls with little sense of the surrounding tumult. Workers pushed carts into closets, eager to complete their week. Music blared from the headphones of high school visitors waiting by a bathroom. Then there were the Comeses. They had not planned to tour the Capitol during their vacation here. But sensing something momentous afoot, they first wandered into the gallery on Thursday. “They adjourned trying to debate what time to start this morning,” said Ms. Comes, 47, marveling at the inanity. “They cited some kind of rule,” her husband added, shrugging beneath a National Hot Rod Association hoodie. The two are not Trump   they suggested, describing the 2016 election as a battle of relative evils. But they expressed satisfaction with Mr. Trump’s efforts so far. “He’s doing good,” Ms. Comes said. “I think more people need to support him. ” “It’s a complicated issue,” Mr. Comes noted, a partial echo of Mr. Trump’s recent musing that “nobody knew that health care could be so complicated. ” Still, the couple, returning soon to their Florida log cabin  —   “our neighbors call us Lincolns,” Mr. Comes said  —   said their attendance on Friday had been instructive. “It’s cool to be a part of history, even if it didn’t happen,” he said. Moments later, a guard walked over. The space was closing to the public. The House was no longer open for business, he said. Or whatever that was.",,502,11.674418604651162,43,0.3187250996015936,0,0,0,0,95.07495623973111,29.27059577780831,83.55239043824702,25.774193548387096,0.8067729083665338,0.01195219123505976,0.049800796812749,0.025896414342629483,0.03187250996015936,0.0199203187250996,0.27689243027888444,0.00597609561752988,0.00398406374501992,0.021912350597609563,0.09163346613545817,0.00199203187250996,0.055776892430278883,0.0099601593625498,0.00199203187250996,0.00398406374501992,0.00398406374501992,0.06573705179282868,0.00398406374501992,0.0796812749003984,0.027888446215139442,0.025896414342629483,0,0,0.0199203187250996,0.0099601593625498,0.09561752988047809,0.00597609561752988,0.00199203187250996,0.00597609561752988,0.00796812749003984,0,0.00597609561752988,0.0697211155378486,0.00597609561752988,0.00597609561752988,0.41832669322709165,0.00597609561752988,0.03187250996015936,0.0099601593625498,0.00199203187250996,0.03187250996015936,0.00199203187250996,0.00398406374501992,0.0199203187250996,0.00796812749003984,0.01593625498007968,0.037848605577689244,0.00597609561752988,0.03187250996015936,0.01593625498007968,0.01593625498007968,0,0,0.013944223107569721,0.2290836653386454,0.0099601593625498,0,0.043824701195219126,0.08964143426294821,0.07569721115537849,0.055776892430278883,0.01593625498007968,0.055776892430278883,0.14143426294820718,0.08764940239043825,0.013944223107569721,0.00597609561752988,0.05976095617529881,0.1693227091633466,0.00199203187250996,0.00796812749003984,0.00398406374501992,0.00398406374501992,0,0,0,0.02390438247011952,0.1294820717131474,0.06772908366533864,0,0.01593625498007968,0.02390438247011952,0.06772908366533864,0.13346613545816732,0.1454183266932271,0.00398406374501992,0.045816733067729085,0.00199203187250996,4,0,20,1,2,0,4,11,3.73,11,12,1,18,0,4,6,38.19,10,51,99.19,38.19,,0.12002728245132872,0,0.4054676781404504,0.032975269612608105,0.06384522569446346,0,0.12002728245132872,0.2727785149790717,0.11283964985126148,0.2727785149790717,0.29037580889212894,0.032975269612608105,0.3803425722950494,0,0.23482902358802726,0.16984774221284243,0.06697767410863045,0.017538013644574614,0.08944386958733053,0.1739595573405356,-0.3818586855481553,0.8260404426594644,31
101,"Some Democrats prepare to withhold paying federal taxes in potentially the biggest tax boycott since the Vietnam War, according to a report from The Guardian. [The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) which campaigns for federal tax boycotts, says there has “renewed interest in war tax resistance following Trump’s inauguration,” with the website’s traffic doubling in the past month.  “Something has clicked in the minds of thousands of people across the country  …     we don’t want to pay for Trump’s agenda! While many of the reasons people are fed up —  extreme militarism, mass incarceration, police brutality, and mass deportations —  are part of the foundation of our country, it is exciting to see many new people contacting NWTRCC and wanting to organize in their communities,” the website reads. The boycott has also attracted the interest of celebrities, with Mia Farrow saying “I refuse to pay a penny of my taxes toward Trump’s insane, insulting wall. ” Feminist activist Gloria Steinhem also pledges her support, telling The Guardian that she will deduct from her tax return money she believes should be going to Planned Parenthood. I refuse to pay a penny of my taxes toward Trump’s insane, insulting wall.  #IstandwithMexico,  —   Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) January 26, 2017,  In December, Time magazine published a column entitled “65 Million Americans Should Threaten to Not Pay Taxes,” urging the “approximately 65 million Democrats who voted for Hillary Clinton [to] pledge that in the future if a Republican wins the presidency with fewer votes than a Democrat for the third time in our era, we won’t pay taxes to the federal government. ” California Democrats have already threatened to “cut off the feds” by withholding taxes, with former State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown claiming the state could become “an organized ” in a state of “  with the federal tax code. ” Before the election, dozens of celebrities promised to effectively boycott America by leaving the country should Donald Trump be elected. The list included singers Barbara Streisand and Miley Cyrus, the actor Bryan Cranston and the comedienne Amy Schumer. Since his election, none of their plans have materialized.

102,"World War III — the first (and final) nuclear war — has never been so likely as it is now. Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Here is the reason why we are currently even closer to a civilization-ending nuclear war than was the case during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962: During the Cold War, the two sides agreed that any war between the capitalist side and the communist side would escalate to nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR and constitute Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.). Therefore, because of this mutual acceptance of M.A.D., hot war didn’t develop during that entire period, from 1945 till the Soviet Union dissolved and ended its military alliance the Warsaw Pact, both of which ended in 1991. Throughout that 45-year period, called “the Cold War,” there was no hot war between the two nuclear superpowers, because both sides believed that any hot war would end in M.A.D. — mutual annihilation, and the end of civilization. It would end that way because any hot war between the two sides would terminate either in one side surrendering to the other, or else in at least one of the two sides (presumably to be started by the one that’s on the brink of defeat in the traditional hot war) nuclear-attacking the other (as being its only alternative to defeat). In other words, M.A.D. recognized and accepted the fact that for a nuclear power to attack a nuclear power with non-nuclear weaponry will almost certainly provoke a nuclear war at the moment when one of the two is losing (or about to lose) the conventional conflict to the other. Nuclear weapons are weapons of last resort, but they exist in order to prevent defeat. That’s what they exist for. If Japan had had deliverable nuclear weapons, then the end of World War II would have been considerably delayed. Japan would have lost because it had no allies, but the end of WW II would have been very different than it was. Only M.A.D. avoided the Cold War becoming a hot war. But M.A.D. is not just a physical reality but equally importantly a mutually-shared belief-system , a belief-system that becomes no longer operative if one of the two sides switches to believe that a way exists actually to win a nuclear war — in other words, to believe that conquest of a nuclear power by another nuclear power is a real possibility. During the years prior to 2006, there was an increasing though unspoken belief at the top of the U.S. aristocracy (the people who control the U.S. government — or at least have controlled it since 1981 ), that the United States would be able to win a nuclear war against Russia; and, suddenly, in 2006, the belief was published, and virtually no one who possessed power or influence challenged it; and, from that time forward, M.A.D. was ended on the American side, and nuclear weapons became, in the U.S., strategized within a new framework (called “nuclear primacy” ) — the framework of nuclear weapons as constituting the ultimate weapons of conquest by the U.S. government. After 1991, when the Warsaw Pact no longer existed, the U.S. military alliance NATO invited into its membership all of the former states of the USSR except Russia (thereby indicating NATO’s continuing hostility toward that particular nation and the fraudulence of NATO’s peace with it), and also invited in all of the USSR’s former Warsaw Pact allies, and so NATO (a now clearly anti-Russian, no longer at all anti-communist, alliance) has come to extend right up to Russia’s own borders — something that the U.S. had refused to allow the USSR to do to the U.S. in 1962, when the Soviet dictator Khrushchev wanted to place nuclear missiles in Cuba just 90 miles from America’s border. In the new era during which the U.S. government and its allies believe that nuclear primacy is about to be achieved, the framework in which the use of ‘nuclear primacy’ would be ‘justified’ is that, as soon as such ‘primacy’ is believed to have been obtained (such as by means of anti-ballistic missiles having been installed that would supposedly annihilate Russia’s nuclear arsenal before their warheads could even be released to retaliate against the U.S.-and-allied nuclear invasion), the U.S. side’s ‘defensive’ traditional-weapons invasion of Russia is being defeated by the Russians, and so the only way available to prevent the defeat of the U.S.-and-allied forces is by the use of nuclear weapons (the ‘taking-advantage’ of America’s ‘nuclear primacy’). That’s how the nuclear attack would be ’justified’, as a ‘necessary defensive response’ against Russia. Consequently, in the current U.S.-NATO operation on and near Russia’s borders , the Alliance is starting the buildup of its traditional invasion forces. This includes even some U.S. allies that aren’t in NATO . The supposed ‘justification’ for this amassing of invasion-forces on Russia’s borders is to ‘defend’ against ‘Russia’s aggression’ when (in March 2014 just weeks after the bloody U.S. coup in Ukraine ) Russia enabled the residents of Crimea to rejoin Crimea as part of Russia, of which Crimea had been until the Soviet dictator Khrushchev arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 . That disagreement about Crimea is the supposed root-cause for NATO’s involvement, even though Ukraine still isn’t (and previously didn’t want to be) a member of the NATO alliance. Anyway: this is the rationalization for NATO’s buildup toward what could become WW III. Ever since 19 February 2016, the U.S. has been storing tanks and artillery , sufficient “to support 15,000 Marines” in undisclosed “confidential” Norwegian caves. Norway has a 200-mile border with Russia. CNN’s news-report on that was accompanied by a video headlined “Russia Reveals Aggressive Military Plans” . It reported that Russia’s (democratically elected, though not mentioned as such) President, Vladimir Putin, was moving troops and weapons toward Norway’s border. (How would the U.S. respond if Russia were to be storing invasion-equipment and troops in Mexico near the U.S. border? Would the U.S. be moving troops and weapons near the Mexican border to protect against an invasion of America; and, if so, then how accurate would it be if Russia’s media then headlined “America Reveals Aggressive Military Plans”? Hitler’s Germany used those sorts of media-tactics, but this time Obama’s America is doing that.) Marine Corps Times headlined on October 24th, “More than 300 Marines heading to Norway in January” . U.S. President Barack Obama means business: he’s getting things set up for Hillary Clinton to finish as his successor. This kind of boldness exceeds anything during the Cold War. America, and its greatly expanded NATO, thus now surrounds Russia not just with its tanks etc., but with its missiles and bombers, on and near Russia’s borders, and so the flight-time from launch to the nuclear-bombing (if the ground-invasion of Russia encounters defeat) will be less than ten minutes, sometimes even less than the time for Russia to get its own missiles launched in retaliation against ours; and so a U.S. blitz nuclear attack against Russia could conceivably be an entirely one-sided war. Here is how that scenario — the end of physical M.A.D. — has actually become the objective sought by the U.S. government (and the necessary backstory for America’s war-drills on Russia’s borders): In 2006, the U.S. aristocracy published in the journal Foreign Affairs, from their Council on Foreign Relations, the first article which said that the U.S. goal should no longer be a continuation of M.A.D., but instead “The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy” , by which the U.S. aristocracy meant the rise of America’s ability to win a nuclear war against Russia. It established this stunning goal merely by saying that such an objective could be achieved and that it should be achieved, and by the article’s being published by the U.S. aristocracy itself (the people who control this country), and by furthermore the U.S. aristocracy not condemning and rejecting and repudiating it but simply letting that article stand with little to no public discussion (and no public debate) about it, much less with the chorus of public condemnations of it in the U.S. press, such as would have happened if America were a democracy — but this nation no longer is a democracy, it has become an aristocracy , and this aristocracy had now published the “Nuclear Primacy” article. (By contrast, in the obscure journal China Security was published in the Autumn 2006 issue the main critique against it, “The Fallacy of Nuclear Primacy” . That article had no impact.) The Foreign Affairs article even was so bold as to assert that “U.S. leaders have always aspired to this goal” (nuclear primacy) — a wild and unsupported allegation that’s not much different from alleging that not only George W. Bush but all U.S. Presidents after World War II were aspiring to have the ability to conquer Russia (and the authors were asserting that only now was this supposedly terrific ability coming within reach). It was explicit about G.W. Bush’s having this desire: “The intentional pursuit of nuclear primacy is, moreover, entirely consistent with the United States’ declared policy of expanding its global dominance. The Bush administration’s 2002 National Security Strategy explicitly states that the United States aims to establish military primacy.” That allegation was tragically true, which is one of the reasons why Bush (like his father, who actually started the determined policy to achieve nuclear primacy) was so dangerous and harmful a President. His invasion of Iraq was merely a sympton of that deeper disease. And, so, this article about “The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy” and “The End of” M.A.D., was now — since it was published by the CFR and not rejected by any influential group — accepted within the U.S. as a goal, “Nuclear Primacy,” which the U.S. government could and should strive for. That idea, of a winnable nuclear war (winnable by the U.S., of course), was no longer heretical, no longer viewed as repugnant. In fact, this article had been introduced and accepted by Harvard University simultaneously in its longer form and simultaneously published by their scholarly journal International Security , which is the leading (it’s the world’s most influential) scholarly journal dealing with that subject, and its title there was “The End of MAD?” . (The periods are customarily removed from the acronym “M.A.D.”, perhaps in order to associate the M.A.D. concept with the pejorative term, insanity. So — at least in the United States — the termination of M.A.D. has always had a favorable ring to it, even before that goal became effectively U.S. policy, which it has been at least ever since 2006.) And no one was saying that Harvard and its journal and the CFR were the ones who were at all “mad” or anything similar, such as “insane.” The aristocracy’s stamp of approval upon the concept of nuclear primacy was clear, from at least 2006 on. Although M.A.D. continued as regards Russia’s side, it no longer remained operative thinking on America’s side. That’s now clear, and this is Russia’s predicament — and the world’s (because a nuclear war involving even just one of the two nuclear superpowers would destroy the world ). U.S. President Barack Obama is putting the goal of nuclear primacy into place, starting with implementation of Ronald Reagan’s proposed “Star Wars” Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system, now called the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, and technically called by the name of its current embodiment: Lockheed Martin’s, Boeing’s, and Raytheon’s, Aegis Ashore system, which Obama first made operational in Romania on 12 May 2016 . It’s designed so as to enable a surprise nuclear attack against Russia in which any missiles that Russia might be able to launch in retaliation will supposedly (if the system works 100%) be annihilated during their launch-phase. Officially , however, its purpose is to defend Europe from being attacked by Iranian missiles. Any public U.S. admission that this ‘defensive’ system is actually preparation for a blitz U.S. nuclear assault on Russia is obviously out of the question. And, obviously, Russians know that Obama is lying and that this is preparation by the U.S. for a blitz nuclear attack against Russia. The West’s ‘news’ media might be such ‘fools’ as not to be aware of that fact, but Putin has made quite clear that he is not, and he is preparing Russia to deal with it. Obama’s action here was made possible by U.S. President George W. Bush’s 2002 unilateral termination of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty with Russia’s predecessor, the Soviet Union. Bush rushed forward with Reagan’s “Star Wars” program even despite there having been no successful tests of the necessary technology: the existing technology consistently failed but Bush decided to invest $53 billion of U.S. taxpayers’ money in it . Bush in 2004 received British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s participation and provisioning of locations and facilities to implement the plan , and Bush was also pressing both Poland and the Czech Republic to allow the U.S. to position ABMs there . Obama came into office criticizing the ABM plan and pretending not to be hostile toward Russia. He deceived Vladimir Putin into thinking that Obama sincerely wanted to pursue peace and cooperation with Russia. As soon as Obama became re-elected, his verbal smiling teeth immediately became actual glaring fangs. Then, soon after his regime overthrew in a bloody February 2014 coup the Moscow-friendly democratically elected President of Ukraine, bordering Russia , Russia started in the summer of 2014 to ignore the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, because for Washington the next step (beyond Ukraine) clearly now would be Moscow and so all bets were off. The installation of the Aegis Ashore in Romania likewise violates that Treaty , which is one important reason why Obama lies to say that all of the Aegis Ashore facilities will be targeted against Iran — and maybe also North Korea — but never against Russia. The full Aegis Ashore system, which will require several such sites, isn’t yet operational. NATO’s PR-arm the Atlantic Council, has mentioned among the Aegis Ashore’s benefits, that for the next such site, in Poland, “Poland announced in late April that it would buy eight Patriot missile batteries from Virginia-based Raytheon Co. in a deal that could generate at least $2.5 billion in US export content.” The U.S. government officials and their friends who have invested in Raytheon and the other ‘defense’ firms didn’t need to be informed of this by any PR person. They already knew of it from more reliable sources, and perhaps they even have invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends’ friends . Lots of money is changing hands during this build-up. Also in 2006, later in that year, specifically on 18 November 2006, was published at Global Research, which is an independent Canadian online international site dealing with geostrategy, a superb summary of the connection that this plan has to America’s string of invasions in the Middle East. It’s titled “Plans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a ‘New Middle East’,” by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, who explains: It should be noted that in his book, “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo-strategic Imperatives,” Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former U.S. National Security Advisor, alluded to the modern Middle East as a control lever of an area he, Brzezinski, calls the Eurasian Balkans. The Eurasian Balkans consists of the Caucasus (Georgia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and Armenia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan) and to some extent both Iran and Turkey. Iran and Turkey both form the northernmost tiers of the Middle East (excluding the Caucasus4) that edge into Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Map of the “New Middle East” A relatively unknown map of the Middle East, NATO-garrisoned Afghanistan, and Pakistan has been circulating around strategic, governmental, NATO, policy and military circles since mid-2006. It has been casually allowed to surface in public, maybe in an attempt to build consensus and to slowly prepare the general public for possible, maybe even cataclysmic, changes in the Middle East. This is a map of a redrawn and restructured Middle East identified as the “New Middle East.” MAP OF THE NEW MIDDLE EAST Note: The following map was prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters. It was published in the Armed Forces Journal in June 2006, Peters is a retired colonel of the U.S. National War Academy. (Map Copyright Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters 2006). Although the map does not officially reflect Pentagon doctrine, it has been used in a training program at NATO’s Defense College for senior military officers. This map, as well as other similar maps, has most probably been used at the National War Academy as well as in military planning circles. Brzezinski’s advocacy of “American Primacy” fits perfectly with the aristocracy’s support of “Nuclear Primacy,” and appeared eight years before it. His 1998 book was seminal also in many other ways. And, as that Nazemroaya article made clear, Brzezinski’s plan was already being put into effect by the U.S. government, even before 2006. However, the person who actually made the seminal decision behind all of this, the decision to conquer Russia, was U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush, on the night of 24 February 1990, just before the Soviet Union ended. He was the person who decided that after the USSR and its Warsaw Pact terminated, NATO would continue that cold war until Russia has been surrounded by U.S. allies, who are Russia’s enemies, when Russia will ultimately either surrender or else be destroyed by the U.S. and its friends. Even if Russia assumes that any such nuclear war would be M.A.D., the government of the U.S. no longer does. That’s Russia’s predicament — and the world’s . However, military planners in the U.S. and its vassal nations, do not include in their calculations the world: the impacts that such nuclear winter and all the rest will have if their dream of ‘nuclear primacy’ amounts to anything more than merely the vicious hoax that it is. This fact, of their ignoring the world, is scandalous — against our military planners. They are so obsessed with ‘victory’, that they are willing to participate in this false and potentially mega-catastrophic dream, of ‘nuclear primacy’. Unless and until nuclear weapons are totally eliminated (which might never happen), their constructive function, of preventing WW III, must continue, not end as a result of ‘nuclear primacy’ and other such lies and delusions. However, the ‘news’ media, especially in ‘The West’, are not pointing out those lies and distortions, but instead reinforcing them. If there is to be a WW III, it will end the world . That is the key fact, which is ignored by ‘The West’s’ military planners. NATO needs to end now, just as the Warsaw Pact did in 1991 — when an indecent, oligarchic , ‘The West’ continued the Cold War despite the Warsaw Pact’s end, and now is making it hot.",,3314,21.66013071895425,153,0.3488231744115872,0,0,0,0,86.80620705683023,22.23842529092981,51.44840072420036,5.3266613022195415,0.7709716354858177,0.019915509957754977,0.06306578153289076,0.045262522631261314,0.04496077248038624,0.012070006035003017,0.22389861194930596,0.021424260712130355,0.0006035003017501509,0.029571514785757393,0.08811104405552203,0,0.07272178636089319,0.004526252263126132,0.0015087507543753772,0.022631261315630657,0.01388050694025347,0.11285455642727821,0.003621001810500905,0.05763427881713941,0.029269764634882317,0.0627640313820157,0.013277006638503319,0.009656004828002414,0.032589016294508145,0.01448400724200362,0.07936028968014484,0,0.00030175015087507544,0.004828002414001207,0,0.00030175015087507544,0.01056125528062764,0.036511768255884126,0.0018105009052504525,0.0018105009052504525,0.4743512371756186,0.002715751357875679,0.0018105009052504525,0.00030175015087507544,0,0.05884127942063971,0.0171997585998793,0,0.01780325890162945,0.012673506336753168,0.0018105009052504525,0.004224502112251056,0.0024140012070006035,0.009656004828002414,0.012070006035003017,0.03168376584188292,0.015691007845503924,0.0006035003017501509,0.02172601086300543,0.2088111044055522,0.00724200362100181,0.010863005431502716,0.009656004828002414,0.07573928786964393,0.039831019915509955,0.026554013277006638,0.012371756185878094,0.04496077248038624,0.13699456849728425,0.08539529269764635,0.015992757996378996,0.0009052504526252263,0.02383826191913096,0.13216656608328303,0.0015087507543753772,0.008750754375377187,0.006336753168376584,0.002112251056125528,0.002715751357875679,0.0012070006035003018,0.00030175015087507544,0.003922751961375981,0.03198551599275799,0.07634278817139409,0.0006035003017501509,0.023536511768255886,0.005733252866626433,0.04828002414001207,0.09595654797827399,0.10018105009052504,0.0012070006035003018,0.02595051297525649,0.015691007845503924,76.95,0,332.70500000000004,8.95,42.75,14.350000000000001,24,71.35,1.83,192.275,51.5,42.375,29.5,0,76.95,16,253.22500000000002,54.35,485.78000000000003,784.18,253.22500000000002,,0.5817765944243484,0,0.8574379063140523,0.13926218514449845,0.43592527271819104,0.20597908703352227,0.3025822873792978,0.5632868051407323,0.03202252888498655,0.7765791820913079,0.482131789830784,0.4337600243338383,0.347806539075621,0,0.42567653117770143,0.22434959625539128,0.06534535169979201,0.01402515496054377,0.12535675762158147,0.20235963232675644,-0.8560194958688803,0.7976403676732435,223
103,"Jonathan Swan reports that White House Chief Strategist and former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon is “united by a common enemy” with his more moderate and liberal peers: WH Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, respectively. [Bannon, Priebus, and Kushner are fighting back against federal bureaucrats trying to take down President Donald Trump through via damaging leaks and collusion with   journalists, the article states.  From Axios: The escalating crisis surrounding the Russia investigation (with reports last night on FBI interest in Jared Kushner) looks like good news for somebody in the White House: Steve Bannon. Nine sources in the West Wing and within Trump’s close orbit said the Russia situation is Bannon’s shot at redemption. He’s being described as a “wartime consigliere” relishing a fight against the “deep state,” media, Democrats and investigators. Why it matters: Bannon had been on very rocky footing recently (to the extent that the President has vented to a number of people about him) but the bolstering of the White House team to respond to the outside crises is a joint effort led by Kushner, Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, two sources said. The senior staff that had been out for each other is now united by a common enemy.   …     [Among Swan’s reasons “why Bannon allies say he’s made for this crisis”:] At Breitbart he ran a   war against the mainstream media  —   one of the two identified enemies for Trump currently (the other is the “deep state,” which the team expects will keep leaking against Trump).

Central Italy was struck twice in quick succession the previous day, with the first tremor hitting it at around 19:11 local time (17:11 GMT). The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and could be felt as far as Rome some 240 km (149 miles). Shortly after a second quake of 6.1-magnitude, struck at around 21:18 local time (19:18 GMT). Buildings were shaking, some parts even caving in, and residents fled into the street to save themselves. Several dozen people have been treated across the region for light injuries, while four are said to have been seriously hurt.

105,"WASHINGTON  —   Shortly after Hillary Clinton was interviewed on Saturday by agents at the F. B. I. ’s headquarters, its director, James B. Comey, heard from his deputies that Mrs. Clinton had been truthful and forthcoming in the      meeting. Mr. Comey, who had been regularly briefed on the progress of the yearlong investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email account as secretary of state, had known for some time that his agents had not uncovered enough evidence to charge her or anyone else with a crime. Now, with the interview done, he told his deputies, according to F. B. I. officials, that he wanted to move forward with a plan he had been working on for months to explain the findings from such a politically contentious investigation to the public. And he did not wait to do it. At 11 a. m. on Tuesday, Mr. Comey walked into a conference room on the first floor of the F. B. I. ’s headquarters, where he stood behind a lectern for 15 minutes and laid out in clinical detail how Mrs. Clinton’s use of the account was “extremely careless. ” But, he said, the bureau would recommend to the Justice Department that she not be charged with a crime because his investigators had found no clear evidence that Mrs. Clinton had intentionally broken the law. The careful approach to publicly explaining his thinking fit a pattern for Mr. Comey, who, throughout his three decades as a law enforcement official, has refused to shy away from politically fraught issues. While he was immediately praised by some for his candor and transparency, it did not insulate him from criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, as well as some legal experts. Republicans contended that Mr. Comey had rushed the decision to clear Mrs. Clinton before the bureau had time to digest what she had said in the interview, and that his decision came suspiciously close to Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton only a week before. They said Mr. Comey’s own description of the F. B. I. ’s findings on Tuesday was enough evidence to file criminal charges. “This defies logic,” said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who leads the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Goodlatte said he had spoken with Mr. Comey immediately after his announcement to express his concerns. Later Tuesday, Mr. Goodlatte sent Mr. Comey a letter demanding answers to eight pointed questions about the handling of the investigation and the implication for future inquiries. Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who now works in private practice in Chicago on cybersecurity and other issues, said it was puzzling for Mr. Comey not to seek criminal charges after laying out significant evidence of serious security breaches. “This decision will not enhance the credibility of the F. B. I. or the director,” he said, given the amount of evidence the agency uncovered about mishandled, classified information. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters and other Democrats contended that Mr. Comey had talked too much, saying it was not fair for him to have laid out the details in a case in which she will not be charged. “He has essentially put himself in the place of judge,” Matthew Miller, a former senior official in the Obama Justice Department who supports Mrs. Clinton, said in a telephone interview. He added, “He’s clearing her, but he’s smearing her at the same time, and the department’s rules prevent that kind of thing from happening. ” “What Director Comey did today was appalling,” Mr. Miller said. He added that the F. B. I. should be laying out its investigative findings in court when prosecutors actually bring a case, not at a televised news conference where charges are not being sought. But Thomas DiBiagio, a Washington lawyer who worked closely with Mr. Comey when both were federal prosecutors at the Justice Department in the Bush administration, said the unusual public nature of the announcement showed Mr. Comey’s willingness to “take the hit” on a controversial decision. “This was a   for him,” Mr. DiBiagio said. “There’s no way he was going to please everyone on this one. Had he decided to recommend charging her, he would have been heavily criticized and scrutinized, and in the decision today, he’s clearly being heavily criticized and scrutinized, too. So he stood up there and said, ‘I’m going to take the criticism.’ That’s what an F. B. I. director does. ” Mr. Comey’s announcement also served to take the spotlight off Ms. Lynch, who was widely criticized after she met Mr. Clinton on her plane in Arizona last week and after she said on Friday that she would defer to the F. B. I. and to prosecutors about whether to bring charges. As deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Comey was at the center of a dramatic dispute with administration officials in 2004, when he refused to reauthorize a secret National Security Agency wiretapping program put into place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Mr. Comey believed parts of the warrantless wiretapping program might have been illegal. That led to a showdown in a Washington hospital room, where Attorney General John Ashcroft was ill. Two of Mr. Bush’s top aides, Andrew H. Card Jr. and Alberto R. Gonzales, were trying to pressure Mr. Ashcroft to sign the order. Mr. Comey met with Mr. Bush the next day about the episode, and he and more than a dozen other officials threatened to resign over what they saw as a usurpation of power by White House officials. Mr. Comey’s testimony about the episode before a Senate committee three years later was the stuff of a Hollywood film, as he described racing to the hospital in an F. B. I. car with sirens blaring to try to get to the attorney general’s room before Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales. In his congressional testimony, Mr. Comey described the events as “the most difficult of my professional career. ” “I was angry,” Mr. Comey told the committee. “I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man, who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me. I thought he had conducted himself in a way that demonstrated a strength I had never seen before, but still I thought it was improper. ” President Obama appointed Mr. Comey in 2013 to head the F. B. I. but Mr. Comey has not shied away from clashing with the administration. Last October, Mr. Comey gave a speech in which he said that additional scrutiny and criticism of police officers after several highly publicized episodes of police brutality might have led to an increase in violent crime in some cities because officers had become less aggressive. “I’ve been told by a senior police leader who urged his force to remember that their political leadership has no tolerance for a viral video,” Mr. Comey said in his speech, adding that many leaders and police officers to whom he had spoken said they were afraid to address the issue publicly. The speech angered senior White House officials, who contended that Mr. Comey had no evidence to back up his claims and that he was undermining their efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system. Just days after the speech, Mr. Comey met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office to discuss their views, but he has continued to voice his opinion on the topic  —   even as White House officials have maintained there is little evidence to support his views.",,1273,15.9125,80,0.31657501963864887,0,0,0,0,89.71592413870496,11.349532700868131,81.89819749049914,13.955428805628609,0.812254516889238,0.014139827179890024,0.047918303220738416,0.030636292223095052,0.029065200314218383,0.002356637863315004,0.18774548311076197,0.01021209740769835,0.004713275726630008,0.01728201099764336,0.08248232521602514,0,0.06834249803613511,0.007069913589945012,0.0007855459544383347,0.00864100549882168,0.0054988216810683424,0.0769835035349568,0,0.05027494108405342,0.025923016496465043,0.04006284367635507,0,0.0015710919088766694,0.021209740769835034,0.004713275726630008,0.10997643362136685,0,0,0,0.014925373134328358,0,0.007069913589945012,0.0816967792615868,0,0,0.46897093479968577,0.004713275726630008,0.0204241948153967,0.006284367635506678,0.014925373134328358,0.04241948153967007,0.01021209740769835,0.0015710919088766694,0.02670856245090338,0.019638648860958365,0.003142183817753339,0.06598586017282011,0.006284367635506678,0.014925373134328358,0.01335428122545169,0.018853102906520033,0.009426551453260016,0.0007855459544383347,0.01021209740769835,0.21602513747054203,0.0015710919088766694,0,0.029850746268656716,0.0974076983503535,0.06834249803613511,0.06677140612725845,0.01021209740769835,0.08641005498821681,0.14689709347996857,0.10919088766692851,0.012568735271013355,0,0.021209740769835034,0.12568735271013354,0,0.007855459544383346,0.004713275726630008,0.0007855459544383347,0.009426551453260016,0,0.0007855459544383347,0.046347211311861744,0.1406127258444619,0.06441476826394343,0,0.012568735271013355,0.0054988216810683424,0.047918303220738416,0.1249018067556952,0.12804399057344854,0,0.05498821681068342,0,7,0,142.77499999999998,0,1,1,7,50.55,7.83,88,25,9.375,3.325,0,7,0,53.53,8,240.975,298.505,53.53,,0.14893617021276595,0,0.7811516892353987,0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.14893617021276595,0.5582551076753175,0.1637047877900899,0.6875,0.38461538461538464,0.189873417721519,0.07674552798615118,0,0.2945326278659612,0,0.03601064241290813,0.005381751154553802,0.1621084355585753,0.20080995354876033,-0.8688899698964951,0.7991900464512397,85
106,"Offensive Aims to Reopen Supply Lines to Nusra-Held East by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This With al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front losing territory in recent weeks around Aleppo, and seeing their main stronghold in the city’s east increasingly surrounded, the group and some of its allies have launched a new offensive south of the city aimed at opening the supply lines back up. Clashes have been reported throughout the day in several areas around government-held western Aleppo , with the attackers coming from further west, likely reinforcements from Nusra’s main territory, the Idlib Province. Locals described substantial fighting. This has been a recurring feature in the battle over Aleppo since 2012, but particularly over the past several months, with each side getting a sizeable advantage only to lose it to a sudden counterattack from the other, leaving the civilian population trapped within. Over the past few weeks, however, it had seemed like Aleppo was really going to be reunified by the military, with Nusra forces on their heels and Russia feeling confident enough to put their airstrikes on hold. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the ceasefire to continue, despite calls from the military to resume attacks. Exactly how far the latest offensive has gotten is a major of debate, with Nusra claiming they’d captured a suburb that amounts to the whole southwestern corner of Aleppo, and government officials denying that they’d lost anywhere near so much. As usual, it will take some time for this to shake out and become clear what territory changed hands.

107,"We Are Change Obama’s brother from Kenya, Malik, wants him to Pardon Julian Assange. It seems hate of the international whistle-blower Organization doesn’t run in the family. Malik told Obama, via twitter, “brother please pardon Julian Assange! All he is doing is freeing emails.”@POTUS brother please pardon Julian Assange! All he is doing is freeing emails— Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 26, 2016 Something that based Obama said himself was that he was for more transparency in government, but that was Obama before he was in office for a few years, that was campaign Obama. Then during his first term he said this about transparency and the truth:“The only people who don’t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.” ~Barack ObamaThose promises were just that, promises, like every year we get together and pretend voting is going to change something; and listen to candidates feed us bull shit when every year election fraud has been the centralized problem that subverts democracy like the plague.And now we have potentially the worst two “choices” for presidential history; both have a corrupt past. We the American people are being asked to forgive one of these two people: Donald Trump for his potentially corrupt deals with the mafia, or Hillary with her long list of corruption since Arkansas in the 1980s, which has expanded since Wikileaks began leaking John Podesta’s emails, confirming that Donald Trump’s nickname “Crooked Hillary” was accurate. Hillary Clinton has cronies in power already; the other, new to politics and a former entertainer and businessman, is Donald Trump. One, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, if voted in, we are going to war; the other, he said there would be peace.The emails that wikileaks has been releasing have revealed a multitude of corruption revelations behind both the Clinton Campaign, exposing Hillary Clinton’s character and demeanor itself. Exposing her pay-to-play schemes as Secretary of State, lies to the American public on issues while in secret taking “big donations” for speeches, the opposite of what she says she supports, and something she calls a “public and private opinion” on issues, which most logical people would call lying and deceiving voters.Obama, himself, lied for Hillary and said he didn’t know about the private server which Wikileaks has exposed. Obama was sending emails back and forth to Hillary’s email address proving that he did indeed know about the server and that the email she was using wasn’t a state.gov-provided email account.So Obama’s brother wants him to forget about all that, the Cablegate scandal which, again, Hillary Clinton was apart of, and more? To say the least, Wikileaks and its founding owner Julian Assange have a long rap sheet with the Obama administration. They have crossed paths many times and Malik wants Barack to just forget about it. That’s unlikely but, hey, it’s the thought that counts, right?In another twist of fate Malik Obama also supports Donald Trump sporting the # Africans4Trump hashtag in his twitter bio, complete with Donald Trump’s signature hashtag #MAGA. He also has a series of tweets that are saying most of what every other normal American, without a President as a brother, is saying, “This election looks rigged.” That’s right Obama’s brother believes in the dreaded chupacabra election fraud monster that visits every 4 years, just another thing that sets him apart from his brother.He additionally mocked Hillary’s pay-to-play scandal tweeting the 100K check he was accidentally sent by a mogul in Tehran . I wonder if Malik has seen the Project Veritas videos ?Do not let my brother rig the election @realDonaldTrump — Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 26, 2016 America always lectures Afrika about elections but this election looks rigged! Vote Trump anyway— Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 27, 2016 Do not cheat Colorado or New Hampshire. I will know and I will be mad— Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 27, 2016 Obama also hates Trump so are we sure these two are really related? Someone get Maury for a DNA test. Apparently Malik also wonders if they are related sometimes too.Well they are half-brothers so that may explain the chemical imbalance in the force some what..All I know is that my brother has done nothing for the Kenyan side of his family. I wonder if we are related sometimes.— Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 25, 2016 Wikileaks additionally in a nod to Malik, tweeted out “Assange & Kenya’s background” with a link to “The looting of Kenya under President Moi.” President Obama's brother calls for @POTUS to pardon Assange https://t.co/BjtaY2wrJ1 Assange & Kenya, background: https://t.co/BQ8EqCXTqD — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 26, 2016    The post Obama’s Brother Malik Supports Trump AND Wants Obama To Pardon Julian Assange appeared first on We Are Change .",,814,33.916666666666664,24,0.3194103194103194,0,0,0.0012285012285012285,0.002457002457002457,71.44258804258804,5.546410046410048,83.72002457002456,32.08125658125658,0.7542997542997543,0.007371007371007371,0.020884520884520884,0.03562653562653563,0.04054054054054054,0.036855036855036855,0.1941031941031941,0.012285012285012284,0.0012285012285012285,0.02334152334152334,0.05896805896805897,0.0012285012285012285,0.08353808353808354,0.002457002457002457,0.0012285012285012285,0.011056511056511056,0.02334152334152334,0.11916461916461916,0.0036855036855036856,0.05528255528255528,0.014742014742014743,0.04791154791154791,0.0085995085995086,0.002457002457002457,0.025798525798525797,0.014742014742014743,0.07493857493857493,0.0036855036855036856,0.018427518427518427,0,0.0085995085995086,0.0012285012285012285,0.01597051597051597,0.042997542997543,0,0,0.4250614250614251,0,0.014742014742014743,0.0036855036855036856,0.0085995085995086,0.05896805896805897,0.011056511056511056,0.0012285012285012285,0.029484029484029485,0.011056511056511056,0.012285012285012284,0.04054054054054054,0.006142506142506142,0.012285012285012284,0.009828009828009828,0.018427518427518427,0.004914004914004914,0.0012285012285012285,0.029484029484029485,0.2321867321867322,0.025798525798525797,0.007371007371007371,0.02334152334152334,0.0343980343980344,0.04054054054054054,0.056511056511056514,0.022113022113022112,0.022113022113022112,0.10319410319410319,0.11547911547911548,0.025798525798525797,0.004914004914004914,0.022113022113022112,0.09828009828009827,0,0.0036855036855036856,0.004914004914004914,0,0.0085995085995086,0.004914004914004914,0,0.033169533169533166,0.13267813267813267,0.044226044226044224,0.0012285012285012285,0.033169533169533166,0.0036855036855036856,0.04176904176904177,0.14373464373464373,0.14987714987714987,0.011056511056511056,0.022113022113022112,0,9.455,0,59.75999999999999,0,15.175,13.73,36.71,54.53999999999999,1.83,59.065000000000005,10.455,10,22.635,0,9.455,0,78.1,52.44,155.915,272.7249999999999,78.1,,0.30146121198501835,0,0.731735070716737,0,0.40920720470983013,0.38525316757358125,0.6262485061899665,0.7134176993912517,0.07708865291484307,0.7294325495271242,0.3230450983017967,0.3133921657949117,0.5081503602322465,0,0.4232815118722852,0,0.07704259044612691,0.05173000567214975,0.1538040395570791,0.2690325285457101,-0.8339680362129613,0.73096747145429,73
108,"MILTON KEYNES (UNITED KINGDOM) (AFP)  —    It’s got money, jobs and it voted Brexit: the town of Milton Keynes near London represents a slice of   voters fed up with a political elite ignoring their concerns. [Just as in the United States, it was not just struggling   workers fed up with the flip side of globalisation who rebelled last year.  “We continually underestimate the silent majority,” said Richard Heffernan, an expert in government at The Open University, which was set up in Milton Keynes shortly after the town was established in 1967. Three days after the inauguration of billionaire property tycoon Donald Trump as US president on January 20, the town will celebrate its 50th anniversary. Enjoying some of the best employment and growth rates in Britain, Milton Keynes could have been fertile ground for those backing the status quo in Britain’s 2016 vote on whether to stay in the European Union. But the   town voted by 51 percent for Britain to leave the bloc, closely mirroring the   vote split across the country. Alongside the state of the economy, Britons who voted to leave the EU said their two other motivating factors were the influx of East European immigrants and the importance of national sovereignty. In Milton Keynes, the latter seemed to dominate. “It was not so much immigration as sovereignty and accountability,”    retired nurse Diana Miller said of her Leave vote as she toured an exhibition to mark the town’s anniversary. In the 1975 referendum on Britain’s entry into what was then the European Economic Community, “we voted for the common market, not a loss of sovereignty,” she said. “We are a powerful country, we value our independence. ”  —   ‘Bang on the money’  —   The townsfolk put their concerns over the EU directly to then prime minister David Cameron in a television special four days before the June 23 referendum. Voters quizzed Cameron on immigration, the possibility of Turkish accession to the bloc and the idea of spending more money on the National Health Service (NHS) instead of the EU budget. The Brexit result exposed a gulf between   metropolitan types and the     north, just as the US vote revealed divisions between city liberals and rural conservatives. Yet in both countries, it was quiet support in those places in between that really made the difference. “As the nation goes, so goes Milton Keynes,” said Heffernan. “It’s moderate, centrist, and since 1997 it has been an electoral bellwether, in the same way as Ohio in the United States. “In terms of Brexit, it was bang on the money. ” But the depth of its euroscepticism did not set alarm bells ringing for the establishment, despite political parties spending years doing focus groups in Milton Keynes, seen it as a microcosm of public opinion. “A lot of people who study politics and analyse it are part of a metropolitan elite,” Heffernan told AFP. “The liberal elite’s inability to represent many people was held against them. ” Following the Brexit and Trump votes there are now a plethora of   movements in Europe seeking to rise up against urban and political elites, as well as against Brussels, and “return” their countries to the struggling middle classes.  —   Boomtown backs Brexit  —   The   story of Milton Keynes is being told in an exhibition entitled “A New City Comes To Life” which is located in the main shopping centre. Built as a 1960s futuristic vision, its   layout is unique in Britain and its   boulevards were   for the motor age. Sited in the prosperous southeast of England, its major local employers include Spanish bank Santander and German carmakers Volkswagen and  . It has seen the highest jobs growth of any British city, up 18 percent between 2004 and 2013. Milton   Katherine Moore, 31, who is qualified in catering but off work while looking after her baby, said: “There’s always good job opportunities here. If you’re trained in those fields, there’s so much work. I will never leave. “The only reason I voted out was the NHS. But we need the foreign people, they built it up. ” Heffernan said it was alienation, not apathy, that stirred hitherto silent centrists into backing Brexit and Trump. “It applies to   professionals as much as to people who hammer metal,” he said. “Politicians are now like rabbits caught in the headlights.

109,"Surely, even in these fractured times, just about everyone could agree on an antislavery measure. Right? Lawmakers in Colorado unanimously agreed to put a question onto the Nov. 8 ballot, asking if voters would like to remove an archaic reference to slavery in the state’s Constitution that allows it as a punishment for crime. There was virtually no public opposition or campaign against the amendment, which was supported by Republicans and Democrats. Newspapers editorialized in favor, and activists considered it a slam dunk. What could go wrong? As it turns out, plenty. As of Thursday afternoon, votes were still being counted  —   but the effort looked as if it was doomed to defeat, with the “no” votes leading the “yes” votes by more than 35, 000 with almost 2. 4 million votes cast. A recount is possible. Was it a hidden racist vote? Could more than a million people in Colorado really be in favor of keeping a slavery loophole? Activists and lawmakers bewildered by the defeat say the answer may be much more simple: Voters say they were disoriented by a mouthful of a ballot question, leaving them unsure what “yes” and “no” actually meant. The   question read: “Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution concerning the removal of the exception to the prohibition of slavery and involuntary servitude when used as a punishment for persons duly convicted of a crime?” “I think people were confused by the language,” said Representative Joe Salazar, a Democrat who sponsored the bipartisan legislation to put the question on the ballot. “I don’t think this was a pushback at all by individuals saying they wanted slavery in the Constitution. I just think the language was too confusing. ” The punishment exception was referring to prison labor when it was written in 1876, but constitutional law experts say it is now unnecessary because of current labor practices. “Many people thought, ‘If I vote yes, I’m voting to put this language in the Constitution,’ because it seemed inconceivable that it was already there,” said Melissa Hart, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Even   lawyers Ms. Hart spoke with were surprised to learn that not only was the language in the state’s Constitution, but it also remains in the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery when it was ratified in 1865. It states: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. ” The language goes back even further  —   to when the United States territory was expanding. Both the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 and the Missouri Compromise in 1820 prohibited slavery but carved out the same exception for criminal punishment. At the time, labor camps in prisons were common as a way to rehabilitate criminals, Professor Hart said. Since the prisoners were working without payment, it was considered a form of indentured servitude. But in the current day, the idea that there could be any situations in which slavery would be allowed did not sit well with activists. “It just shouldn’t be a Colorado value,” said William Dickerson, a community activist with Together Colorado, a   organization that led the campaign to remove the language. “It shouldn’t be in the bedrock of our founding document, both on the state level and on the national level. ” Activists said the effort might also have been hurt by a state voter guide that was mailed to every registered voter, which was required to list arguments for and against the amendment. It said the change could “result in legal uncertainty around current offender work practices in the state. ” That was a “  argument” that was concocted to meet the legal standard for having an argument against it, but few people were genuinely concerned, Mr. Salazar said. Nonetheless, some voters could have been persuaded by it, he said. The voter guide also said that 25 states did not have language related to slavery in their constitutions, and that those states had had no issues with their prison work and community service programs. “Removing the language reflects fundamental values of freedom and equality, and makes an important symbolic statement,” it said. Though stunned by the apparent defeat, those supporting the change are vowing to get the question on a ballot again  —   next time, with simpler language. “We’re going to do it again,” Mr. Salazar said. “We’re going to make sure we finally rid the Constitution of that language. ”",,761,19.512820512820515,39,0.3508541392904074,0,0,0,0,89.12029967404474,25.681644129823525,61.893611644597186,19.8580814717477,0.835742444152431,0.01576872536136662,0.035479632063074903,0.04730617608409987,0.04862023653088042,0.013140604467805518,0.1721419185282523,0.011826544021024968,0.005256241787122208,0.011826544021024968,0.10643889618922471,0.005256241787122208,0.08541392904073587,0.002628120893561104,0.001314060446780552,0.017082785808147174,0.009198423127463863,0.12614980289093297,0.003942181340341655,0.05519053876478318,0.022339027595269383,0.05387647831800263,0,0,0.03810775295663601,0.018396846254927726,0.08409986859395532,0,0,0.001314060446780552,0.001314060446780552,0,0.009198423127463863,0.06964520367936924,0,0,0.4980289093298292,0.001314060446780552,0.02102496714848883,0,0.006570302233902759,0.05781865965834428,0.006570302233902759,0,0.030223390275952694,0.01445466491458607,0.001314060446780552,0.003942181340341655,0.001314060446780552,0.022339027595269383,0.017082785808147174,0.024967148488830485,0,0.001314060446780552,0.017082785808147174,0.23390275952693823,0.003942181340341655,0,0.0328515111695138,0.04730617608409987,0.04467805519053877,0.02102496714848883,0.02102496714848883,0.05519053876478318,0.1392904073587385,0.07884362680683311,0.01971090670170828,0.006570302233902759,0.04336399474375821,0.11563731931668857,0.001314060446780552,0.001314060446780552,0.003942181340341655,0.002628120893561104,0.010512483574244415,0,0,0.001314060446780552,0.08672798948751642,0.06438896189224705,0,0.03153745072273324,0.00788436268068331,0.02890932982917214,0.1340341655716163,0.15374507227332457,0.005256241787122208,0.04204993429697766,0,22,0,187,0,7,12,4,15,0,106,14,8.625,36.125,8,22,10,69.75,26,249,340.75,69.75,,0.44063027677646427,0,0.8700568669346987,0,0.20040952204208645,0.3005373601422242,0.12528000045831353,0.3494183807442671,0,0.7914672064576306,0.33390191990673007,0.23595564579199965,0.5639818468977833,0.2226645819836635,0.7671238719347365,0.2636541189343807,0.06786669909997567,0.02529798102651423,0.2422768182923863,0.331549501337874,-0.9007609312147485,0.668450498662126,74
110,"Proud Shares The NRA’s magazine acknowledged that President Obama “really hasn’t had the opportunity to” confiscate firearms, undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a “ massive Obama conspiracy ” to dismantle the Second Amendment and take guns away. The NRA’s admission that a president can’t confiscate guns because “Congress writes the laws, not the president” also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the NRA that link Hillary Clinton to gun confiscation. The admission was included in a June 9 article for NRA magazine America’s 1st Freedom which took issue with how Obama “rudely” responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event. The article quoted Obama as telling the questioner, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” Responding to Obama’s statement, the article acknowledged, “Now, [the gun store owner]could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president”: Rhude didn’t sit down after asking his question. Rather, he stood silently as President Obama didn’t even try to answer his question, but instead went off on a defensive tirade: “First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks’ guns is just not true. And I don’t care how many times the NRA says it.” Obama then said, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” Now, Rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms — from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama’s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a “pen and phone” to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent. Claims about gun confiscation and Obama have been the NRA’s bread and butter for the past eight years . More recently, the NRA has suggested that the election of Clinton could lead to gun confiscation for law-abiding Americans.

South Korea has suggested that the killing was the work of the North Korean government. The revelation that a banned weapon was used in such a   killing raises the stakes over how Malaysia and the international community will respond. VX nerve agent can be delivered in two compounds that are mixed at the last moment to create a lethal dose. The police say that two women approached Mr. Kim at the airport with the poison on their hands and rubbed it on his face one after the other. Samples were taken from Mr. Kim’s skin and eyes. The poison was identified in a preliminary analysis by the Center for Chemical Weapons Analysis of the Chemistry Department of Malaysia, Mr. Khalid said. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and North Korea is among the world’s largest possessors of such weapons. In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the North had stockpiled 2, 500 to 5, 000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons. (The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006.) VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides. It is tasteless and odorless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions, which eventually stop the victim from breathing. A dose of about 10 milligrams is enough to kill by skin contact, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Several world powers, including the United States and the former Soviet Union, once had large stockpiles of the nerve agent. American stores of VX were destroyed under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, with incineration completed in 2012. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three people, one of whom died. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4, 500 metric tons during a typical year and 12, 000 tons during a period of extended crisis. It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year. The announcement by Malaysia’s police chief came just a day after North Korea denied any responsibility for Mr. Kim’s death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang’s involvement under the influence of South Korea. With the North’s reclusive government on the defensive about the Feb. 13 killing of Mr. Kim, the estranged half brother of Kim   at the airport for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death “rests with the government of Malaysia” because Kim   died there. And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia, the statement noted that North Korea is a “nuclear weapons state. ” But in a case that has been filled with mysteries and odd plot twists, North Korea still would not acknowledge that the man killed was indeed Kim  . And it gave no indication that it would agree to Malaysia’s demands to question a senior staff member at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the investigation into Mr. Kim’s death. Relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing, by applying poison to   ’s face as North Korean agents looked on, insisted they must have been duped into doing so, though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise. “I don’t believe Huong did such a thing,” said Doan Van Thanh, father of Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese woman being held in Malaysia. “She was a very timid girl. When she saw a rat or frog, she would scream. ” Mr. Thanh, 63, said he had seen little of his daughter recently. He said she left the family’s home, in a village south of Hanoi, at 17 to attend community college, where she studied to be a pharmacist. She later left Vietnam to work in Malaysia without telling her family and rarely visited, Mr. Thanh said. When she returned home in January for the Tet holiday, he said, she stayed only a few days. On Thursday in Nghia Binh, Ms. Huong’s hometown, her brother, Doan Van Binh, said that she posted on Facebook under the alias Ruby Ruby. Her Facebook photographs and the attached location information appear to show that she had visited Malaysia twice since January, and her Facebook friends include several people who write in Korean. Mr. Binh said that Ms. Huong had also appeared in a singing contest on the television show “Vietnam Idol” in 2016. In a short video clip, a panel of judges rejected Ms. Huong after she sang just one line: “I want to stop breathing gloriously so that the loving memory will not fade. ” North Korea has called for the release of Ms. Huong, an Indonesian woman and a North Korean man who are being held by Malaysia in connection with the death of Mr. Kim. The statement on Thursday from the Jurists Committee was cited by the   Korean Central News Agency, in the first comment on the killing from the North’s official news media. The statement accused the Malaysian authorities of pursuing a case “full of loopholes and contradictions” that proved that its investigators “intended to frame us. ” It said Malaysia had done so under South Korean influence. The statement said Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry and the local hospital first told the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that Mr. Kim had died of “heart stroke,” asking North Korea to take the body and cremate it. But Malaysian officials’ attitude began changing after the South Korean news media, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mr. Kim had been poisoned, according to the North Korean statement. “The Malaysian secret police got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established fact” that the death had been a poisoning, according to the North Korean statement, which did not refer to Mr. Kim by name. The statement questioned how Ms. Huong and the Indonesian suspect in the killing, Siti Aisyah, 25, had survived if, as Malaysian officials said, they had used their hands to apply a deadly poison.",,1115,25.34090909090909,44,0.3183856502242152,0,0,0,0,97.70239545570685,14.0346514472075,79.28176382660686,1.391519388024268,0.7937219730941704,0.010762331838565023,0.025112107623318385,0.021524663677130046,0.045739910313901344,0.017040358744394617,0.14887892376681613,0.03228699551569507,0.0026905829596412557,0.013452914798206279,0.10941704035874439,0.0017937219730941704,0.05560538116591928,0.029596412556053813,0.014349775784753363,0.019730941704035873,0.004484304932735426,0.06457399103139014,0.0008968609865470852,0.05829596412556054,0.013452914798206279,0.04125560538116592,0,0.017937219730941704,0.010762331838565023,0.007174887892376682,0.08609865470852018,0,0.008071748878923767,0.008968609865470852,0.023318385650224215,0,0.0026905829596412557,0.07354260089686099,0.0026905829596412557,0.0026905829596412557,0.4170403587443946,0.015246636771300448,0.017937219730941704,0.004484304932735426,0.0017937219730941704,0.03228699551569507,0.0017937219730941704,0,0.021524663677130046,0.011659192825112108,0.010762331838565023,0.021524663677130046,0.0026905829596412557,0.009865470852017937,0.006278026905829596,0.03856502242152467,0,0,0.033183856502242155,0.18834080717488788,0.0008968609865470852,0.0008968609865470852,0.03766816143497758,0.05650224215246637,0.07174887892376682,0.0242152466367713,0.007174887892376682,0.054708520179372194,0.14260089686098654,0.05650224215246637,0.008968609865470852,0,0.017937219730941704,0.13632286995515694,0.0017937219730941704,0.003587443946188341,0.004484304932735426,0.0008968609865470852,0.009865470852017937,0,0,0.017937219730941704,0.09955156950672646,0.09058295964125561,0,0.007174887892376682,0.003587443946188341,0.03766816143497758,0.10852017937219731,0.11121076233183856,0.0008968609865470852,0.03856502242152467,0,22,0,259.775,4,8,7,4,29.7,1,144.675,7,8,30.525,0,22,0,64.525,13,322.275,395.79999999999995,64.525,,0.4258218860212584,0,0.8975096217983317,0.11881849050177154,0.21239994067041815,0.19091884192380093,0.11881849050177154,0.5002965229833692,0.03261068708575956,0.8298449638115002,0.19091884192380093,0.21239994067041815,0.5071457800001362,0,0.6367492953311963,0,0.04547857344234565,0.009162672681138991,0.22714617987031294,0.2789681420919086,-0.9247427091637783,0.7210318579080914,92
112,"The World Economic Forum’s annual gathering of globalist political, financial and cultural elitists is underway in Davos, Switzerland, but the organization’s founder is planning an emergency Washington, D. C. meeting in 2017 for worried elites worldwide to discuss how to deal with   Donald J. Trump. [“The World Economic Forum is listening to Donald Trump,” Bloomberg’s Stephen Morris and Erik Schatzker wrote on Sunday. “The organization will convene a special meeting in Washington this year to discuss issues raised during the  ’s campaign and the populist wave that swept him to victory, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told Bloomberg Television on Sunday. The gathering will explore U. S. investment and   opportunities for companies that participate in the forum, he said. ”  Klaus Schwab, who in 1971 founded the group that eventually became the World Economic Forum which hosts the annual retreat for business, political and cultural elites in the Swiss Alps, told Bloomberg that the event in Washington, D. C. —  which was previously not planned —  is going to be meant to address globalist concerns with the rise of populism as evidenced by the election of Trump to the presidency. “It’s very natural that with the new administration we plan a major event in the U. S. to see what are the implications of the new president and how the business community could engage,” Schwab said, adding that in Davos in 2017 there are populists present who the globalists plan to hear from to try to assuage a “silent fear” of the masses. “People have become very emotionalized, this silent fear of what the new world will bring,” Schwab added. “We have populists here and we want to listen. We have to respond to these individuals’ fears and to offer solutions. It’s not just enough to listen we have to provide answers and that’s what we’re here for in Davos. ” Schwab said that the Davos gathering is not supposed to be about the glamorous parties and receptions for the elites present, or about the “outrageous excesses of life” exhibited by them there, but rather his goal is to create a “global village” where in the words of Morris and Schatzker “participants can mull weighty issues facing the world without the distractions of a large city. ” “My biggest fear is that we will believe there are very simple answers to very difficult questions,” Schwab said. “The right solution will require a lot of effort and many steps in the right direction. I am optimistic that in a new   world we still have the notion of a joined and shared destiny. ” In 2017, the “Party of Davos” so to speak, the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering there in the Swiss Alps, is as Breitbart News has previously reported a gloomier event than usual. Last year, the world elites gathered in Davos were certain that British voters wouldn’t vote to Leave the European Union and that Donald J. Trump would never be elected president of the United States —  and that all these fears of populist uprisings around the world would never materialize. But they were wrong, and now Davos attendees are scrambling to try to figure out why.",,530,19.62962962962963,27,0.3169811320754717,0,0,0,0,91.32277628032345,24.14819182389937,78.04661487236403,25.774193548387096,0.8056603773584906,0.03962264150943396,0.03773584905660377,0.04716981132075472,0.03962264150943396,0.03962264150943396,0.16792452830188678,0.0018867924528301887,0.011320754716981131,0.020754716981132074,0.09622641509433963,0,0.07358490566037736,0.0018867924528301887,0,0.01509433962264151,0.007547169811320755,0.07735849056603773,0,0.04339622641509434,0.009433962264150943,0.04716981132075472,0,0,0.018867924528301886,0.011320754716981131,0.10566037735849057,0,0,0,0,0,0.020754716981132074,0.035849056603773584,0,0,0.47735849056603774,0.0018867924528301887,0.020754716981132074,0.0018867924528301887,0.0037735849056603774,0.04905660377358491,0.0037735849056603774,0,0.022641509433962263,0.020754716981132074,0.005660377358490566,0.005660377358490566,0.01509433962264151,0.013207547169811321,0.013207547169811321,0.018867924528301886,0.0037735849056603774,0,0.007547169811320755,0.2,0.007547169811320755,0,0.024528301886792454,0.0509433962264151,0.052830188679245285,0.03207547169811321,0.018867924528301886,0.02830188679245283,0.1471698113207547,0.08113207547169811,0.011320754716981131,0,0.045283018867924525,0.13962264150943396,0,0.011320754716981131,0.0037735849056603774,0.0018867924528301887,0.0037735849056603774,0,0,0.005660377358490566,0.09433962264150944,0.07924528301886792,0,0.011320754716981131,0.0037735849056603774,0.04905660377358491,0.13773584905660377,0.12264150943396226,0.01509433962264151,0.045283018867924525,0.0037735849056603774,4,0,17,3,6.25,6,4,2,3,49,4,27.875,7,0,4,0,44.5,10,84.5,139,44.5,,0.14685419906293512,0,0.4224872562277152,0.11433841851550566,0.21195134219893327,0.20521309615767264,0.14685419906293512,0.07924589581061381,0.11433841851550566,0.6783142913568079,0.14685419906293512,0.5453613463112802,0.23149755710939207,0,0.3497687321578013,0,0.07007874015748032,0.015748031496062992,0.13307086614173227,0.2188976377952756,-0.7088217526269177,0.7811023622047244,34
113,"We Are Change A month ago, this writer told you about an ongoing conflict within the FBI that was validated by online and personal sources concerning the outcome of the Clinton investigation. Now it’s been revealed that the FBI has been flooded with resignations letters by disenfranchised agents ever since Comey decided last July not to indict Hillary Clinton. Comey’s now attempting to save face has reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server claiming that the FBI has now found an additional 650,000 email messages on Anthony Weiner’s laptop, ten thousand of which were found were in a folder called “Life Insurance.” Things are boiling up for the Clinton campaign, what an October surprise!10,000 new emails found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner's computer and phones. They were in a file marked ""Life Insurance"". #Corruption — Morgan Brittany (@MorganBrittany4) October 29, 2016 Weiner is under investigation for sending sexually explicit pictures and material to a 15 year old girl and it drags Hillary’s campaign and chances of presidency with it..Huma Mahmood Abedin, recently divorced from Weiner, has worked with Hillary Clinton since 1996, where she began as a white-house intern She quickly grew her political career to the position of vice chairman of the Hillary campaign.What could be found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner’s laptop?A source has a guess at what may potentially be found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner’s computer: Huma’s long-speculated ties to the Muslim Brotherhood , something that U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann asserted in 2012 when she accused Huma Abedin of being a mole for the Muslim Brotherhood . Bachmann then said during a live broadcast interview that “the infiltration of our government is much wider than anyone expected.”“It appears that there has been deep penetration in the halls of our United States government by the Muslim Brotherhood,” Bachmann stated during a radio interview. “It appears that there are individuals who are associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who have positions, very sensitive positions, in our Department of Justice, our Department of Homeland Security, potentially even in the National Intelligence Agency.” ~U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, said.Huma actually hasn’t been shy about her potential connection to the brotherhood, earlier in 2016 she confirmed that her Muslim Brotherhood-connected mother Saleha Mahmoud Abedin was proud of her .Saleha Mahmoud Abedin was identified in 2011 as one of 63 suspected leaders inside the Muslim Sisterhood. Well we are about to truly find out what was on the laptop of Huma Abedin as the FBI as of Sunday filed for the warrant needed to begin looking through the emails.Again my source asserts that, “Huma Abedin was copying emails and printing them and she was labeled a threat by the FBI in it’s own report about the Clinton investigation.” Huma herself said in an interview this week with a podcast that she has yet to read the emails she exchanged with her longtime boss, Hillary Clinton, but that she is “mortified” by what may be in them.“Terrifying,” is how Abedin described the existence of the records in the public domain during an interview on the “Call Your Girlfriend” podcast.“I confess I have not read anything that has become public,” Abedin, said.Comey has jumped on this chance to right his wrongs, seizing an opportunity to save his own career and reputation as well as the FBI’s reputation which, according to a source, has been tarnished. Agents are not happy about the outcome and conduct of the former Director, including some agents that have decided enough is enough and are resigning in droves .The FBI director has been embroiled in an inside fight against his own agents worried about internal leaks. Comey said it himself in his reasoning for announcing the re-opening of the Clinton email investigation.Ex-FBI Assistant Director of New York, James Kallstrom weighed in on Comey’s actions calling the Clintons a crime family . Kallstrom also acknowledged the fact that agents were rebelling within the ranks including senior agents. “The agents are furious with what’s going on, I know that for a fact,”‘The Clintons, that’s a crime family. It’s like organized crime, basically. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool,” ~former FBI, assistant director, James Kallstrom , said.Kallstrom additionally told Fox’s Judge Jeanine Pirro, “I think there is something happening, I think something big is going to happen,” when confronted with the question on why Comey chose 2 weeks before the election to announce the re-opening of an investigation, politicizing the investigation.Kallstrom made sure to not leave out that it was the higher power of the FBI to blame and not the field agents who were involved in the overall investigation into the Clintons server.Meanwhile several FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys are busy investigating and collecting evidence on the Clinton Fraudation. The investigation backed by none other then the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, who is also investigating Anthony Weiner, who authorized the warrants for the devices to be seized. That means that Preet Bharara is behind both cases on the Clintons – the investigation into the Clinton Fraudation , in which Bharara is leading NY, DC, and Texas branches of the FBI’s investigation into the Clinton’s long time fraud vehicle the “Clinton Foundation”. The Clinton Fraudation investigation was started when Terry Mccauflife was linked to the Clintons and the Chinese mob .Wikileaks has proven that the Clinton foundation is basically a large money-laundering operation sprinkled with a bit of fraud thanks to Doug Band. Although hacked documents can’t be used for prosecution the new Wiener emails may be identical copies of Huma’s emails that have been leaked in Wikileaks releases, and if it’s true that she printed out copies she could face charges. Additionally there may be evidence of pay-to-play in Huma’s emails as well as fraud, or potentially her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. We will have to wait to see; stay tuned to WeAreChange for your coverage and analysis of the most eventful election cycle in American history. If what the birds are chirping is true.

114,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The F. B. I. director, James Comey, said the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. That lifted a legal cloud hanging over her campaign. But, in keeping with a long career of diving into thorny political conflicts, he rebuked Mrs. Clinton for being “extremely careless” and the State Department for lax security. He noted that hostile governments might have gained access to her personal account. Some of Mrs. Clinton’s aides could still be punished, potentially costing them security clearances in a Clinton administration. _____ 2. President Obama made his first campaign appearance alongside Mrs. Clinton in North Carolina, just hours after Mr. Comey spoke. “I can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested,” the president said. “There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office. ” _____ 3. Britain’s pound hit a   low against the dollar as concerns over the country’s exit from the European Union mount. Theresa May, Britain’s home secretary, has emerged as the   for prime minister, to replace David Cameron. One lawmaker has called her “a bloody difficult woman. ” Even the art world is trying to grapple with the seismic shift, although one writer said the news itself was “playing out as a fascinating, twisting narrative. ” _____ 4. NASA’s Juno spacecraft completed a   voyage and has begun 20 months of orbits around Jupiter to collect data and images. The planet, most likely the first formed after the sun, could hold the keys to understanding the origins of the solar system. “Now the fun begins,” the lead scientist on the project said. _____ 5. PBS fended off fireworks from viewers after admitting that its broadcast of the Independence Day Show from the National Mall in Washington tried to compensate for   visibility problems by intercutting footage of pyrotechnics from previous years. The channel tweeted that its choice was “the patriotic thing to do,” but a Washington Post reporter tweeted back, “the Milli Vanilli of fireworks #shame. ” _____ 6. Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer is not as random as many people believe. Our health columnist, a doctor, reviewed cancer studies and concluded that attention to diet and exercise, and avoiding smoking, can significantly lower our vulnerability. One study showed that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting cancer was because of intrinsic risk factors, or “bad luck. ” _____ 7. A French parliamentary panel found widespread intelligence failures connected to the terrorist attacks in Paris last year. Taking a page from the U. S. after the   attacks, the panel urged that the nation’s intelligence agencies be merged. “Today we don’t measure up to those who are attacking us,” a lawmaker said. _____ 8. This Palestinian doctor, pictured with his family, has become a cause célèbre in Israel after helping save the lives of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. He happened upon an overturned car and helped treat the injured. A Palestinian medic had to warn him to flee to avoid being set upon by other settlers who might have mistaken him for the gunman who fired on the car. _____ 9. Venus Williams advanced at Wimbledon, reaching a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2010 United States Open. “I don’t have any regrets about anything that’s taken place in between,” she said, referring to troubles, including a diagnosis of an   disease and a back injury. “It’s been a journey, but it’s made me stronger. ” Her sister, Serena, is also in the semifinals. _____ 10. Finally, one of our   pieces today taps into the confusion over what we should be eating. Nutritionists and ordinary Americans tend to agree that soda and bacon aren’t so good for you, and that kale and fresh fruit are. But the experts rate sushi and tofu high, while the public elevates granola bars and orange juice. Both sides have mixed feelings about popcorn, pork chops and whole milk. So bon appétit and good luck. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.

115,"About Media skeptic After Abandoning Kurds to Erdogan's Invasion US Now Expects Them to Win the 'Race to Raqqa' for It But the Kurdish militias are saying they don't intend to expose themselves to a Turkish stab in the back Donate! The failure to give Turkey a red light comes back to bite US Secretary of Defense explained yesterday that the push to take ISIS capital in Raqqa, eastern Syria will begin within weeks. (And BTW Russia is not invited .) ""It starts in the next few weeks,"" he said, referring to the timeline for an assault led by Arab and Kurdish fighters on ISIS' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. ""That has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both."" Carter added: ""It's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqa would follow soon behind. "" Take from this what you will. Perhaps this is empty talk to boost the Democrats' ISIS-fighting credentials and help Hillary on November 8. Perhaps it is a ruse of war meant to prevent ISIS from reinforcing Mosul from Syria. Or perhaps Ash Carter is actually serious. In which case I fear for Ash Carter. Americans have explained that when they mean they're going to take Raqqa that really means that Syrian Kurds are going to take Raqqa for them: ""The only force that is capable on any near term timeline are the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion,"" said Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend in a news briefing. ""We'll move soon to isolate Raqqa with the forces that are ready to go."" In fact the Kurdish YPG are more than a ""significant portion"" of the SDF, they're easily 75% of its fighting strength, probably more. And herein lies the problem because even as US officials acknowledge Kurds aren't exactly eager to die so US can claim credit for expelling ISIS from a wholly non-Kurdish city. Arab forces are expected to be the ones to take the city itself, U.S. officials say. ""Truthfully, the Kurds that I’ve dealt with don’t intend – they’re not comfortable going into Raqqa. They know they can play a role in shaping and isolating Raqqa but it’s not their intent to be involved in the actual seizure of the city,"" the U.S. military official said. Here is a fact. If YPG doesn't want to enter Raqqa, then SDF can not enter Raqqa. The satellite Arab formations of the SDF have nowhere the strength to face off against the Caliphate. In fact what the Kurds have been saying recently is that they may be willing to march on Raqqa but it is going to cost the US a lot more in political support and military supplies than what they've been getting so far. SDF Spokesman Talal Ali Silo: Our target is wherever ISIS occupies. Currently, our targets are Dêra Zor and Raqqa. However, al-Bab Military Council is demanding our help. We will meet their demands for militaristic and logistic help. Raqqa Operation requires great power and opportunities. It requires a lot of preparation. We receive some aid, but it is limited and done covertly. We demanded that International Coalition forces and the US give militaristic and political support overtly and officially. We demanded advanced weaponry, missiles, armored vehicles, panzers etc. They have been promised, but not delivered. This was two weeks ago, however. Ie, before the Turkish and US-backed rebels attempted an offensive against the Kurdish Afrin enclave. -- Their most ferocious assault against the SDF so far. As Turkish artillery and aircraft pounded the Kurds in support of attacking Islamists the US limited itself to 'expressing concern', 'calling on all sides to stand down'. US State Department spokesman John Kirby : “We are concerned about reports of civilian casualties in recent air and artillery strikes in northern Syria. We call on all sides to stand down and focus on greater threats.” In other words, as far as we know the US didn't lift a finger to protect the SDF against Erdogan's 'Euphrates Shield'. Instead it was actually forced to issue denials that it was part of the offensive. If Turkish media is to be believed Assad actually did more to support the Kurds than the US. Turkish pro-Erdogan media claimed that a Syrian helicopter struck the Turkish-backed rebels killing 2 and wounding 5. Kurds also captured footage ( 1:18 ) of what appeared like a Russian Su-30 fighter in the area -- perhaps as a cover for the helicopter if such a strike indeed took place. At this point the Kurds aren't worrying about Raqqa. They're worrying about the next Turkish offensive, and how a push to Raqqa would expose them to that : Syria's Kurds fear a ""stab in the back"" by Turkey if they join a push to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa, one of their chief political leaders told Reuters on Tuesday. ""It is very important that Raqqa is liberated. But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back ,"" he said. So here is the deal for Syrian Kurds from the American Empire: Accept only limited recognition and political support. Only limited supplies of weapons of the type you already have. Expect even this limited support to not extend to your Afrin enclave.

117,"TOPEKA, Kan.  —   Timothy Shahid and Joshua Kalina met, went drinking, became friends and then had a falling out that lead to the murder of one of the young men, all in a matter of hours. The victim’s mother, her life suddenly a disordered jumble marked by panic attacks and nightmares, decided to seek out her son’s killer to try to understand what had prompted an act of violence so baffling that even the gunman was at a loss.  With the aid of a restorative justice program, which brings together victims and those who have caused them harm, the two ultimately met  —   each seeking a way out of grief, fear and guilt. Here’s a look at Timothy, Joshua and Joshua’s mother as she becomes involved in the program. (In this related article, read about a meeting between the parents of a college student and the man convicted in the   accident that killed their son.) “I probably broke my mom’s heart when I told her that,” Timothy, now 30, said. “The road I was leading, I knew I was going to end up in one of those two places. ” At 14, Timothy and some other boys robbed a pawnshop, and he spent two years in a juvenile facility. By age 16, he was “religiously” carrying a gun that he sometimes used. He did not elaborate. “Hanging out with a group of kids gave me hope,” said Timothy, who was tormented by his adoption, and the parents he never knew. “I didn’t think my biological mother loved me. ” At the time of the shooting, Timothy was working at a telemarketing center. He spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of Hennessy a day. He customized the black 2005 Nissan Altima with special wheel rims, and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine. Joshua grew up in Topeka with his mother, Judi Bergquist, and was especially close to his older brother. He liked to play practical jokes on those close to him. “He was so funny,” his mother said. He had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school. Problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face. Ms. Bergquist said Joshua began hanging out with what she described as a “rougher” group of friends after graduating, so she sent him to Texas to live with her parents. He returned to Topeka about two years later and found work at a   service. But persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother. “The day he died, he called me in the late afternoon,” Ms. Bergquist said. “He was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make. ” He’d screamed at her. A few hours later, she said Joshua drove slowly by her house but didn’t stop. It was the last time she saw him alive. Hours later, Timothy and Joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend. The two seemed to hit it off. “He didn’t come off as a person I couldn’t get along with. I was easy to get along with,” Timothy said. “I rode around with Josh in his car. ” But as the night of April 23, 2007, wore on, their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering, and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar. “He said something about one of my friends, so I said something about one of his friends,” said Timothy, who called someone to pick him up. “We were going out the door at the same time, still arguing. I actually opened his car door and then I walk off. I just told him to get in the car. That’s when me and his friend, we’re arguing now . .. All I see was him pull out a weapon . .. I thought he had a gun. ” He fired eight times, and a friend of Timothy’s fired twice more before they fled, the police said. Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. “My   was it was better him than me,” Timothy said. “I didn’t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don’t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand. ” Joshua was unarmed, police said Timothy’s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. “I actually took her son’s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that’s when I laughed at her,” he said. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall   man  —   the loose description of Timothy’s accomplice. “If I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,” she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Timothy was impassive: “I didn’t care about life. ” “I knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,” said Ms. Bergquist. “I needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn’t want this to happen to anyone else. ” The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a    meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: “If you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got. ” The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. “I had a lot of time,” he said. “You got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness  —   that I took a life that I can never give back. ” What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a    encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved.

Timothy, who killed Joshua Ms. Chavez Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist Timothy Ms. Bergquist In April 2016, the two met again  —   this time at a victims’ awareness event at the prison in front of inmates. “She called me her friend,” Timothy said. “A woman forgiving her son’s killer and calling him her friend. And at the end, she got up and gave me a hug. You just don’t see that too often. ” (In this related article, Zachary Harrison struggles to understand why the parents of the man he killed want to meet him.)

118,"FBI Found ""Tens Of Thousands Of Emails"" Belonging To Huma Abedin On Weiner's Laptop   Zero Hedge With furious Democrats - and the Clinton Campaign - now openly blasting the FBI's reopened investigation (as Republicans take delight for once in having a government agency reinforce their side of events), the question turns to just what emails were found on Weiner's laptop, and how damaging their contents are for the FBI to take the unprecedented step of ""intervening"" in a major political event just days before the national election. We first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday , when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at , courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release. Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails – two-thirds of the total – were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton’s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. One email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton’s private email server at . Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving “timetables and deliverables” for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. However, while forwarding Hillary's emails to her personal email server for ""convenience"" is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner's computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with “PAGE DENIED” stamped across the first redacted page. An argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission. This is a nuanced point being pushed by Hillary Clinton supporters such as Newsweek's Kurt Eichenwald, who in an article yesterday tried to make a case citing ""sources"" (even though the FBI said that nobody has seen the content of the Weiner/Abedin emails), that "" no emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton ."" No emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton. All of this has to do with procedures followed by an aide. https://t.co/mcsBi7j7XU — Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 It remains to be seen just what is in the emails, although whether Hillary sent emails with confidential content herself, or directed, or simply allowed her closest aide, Huma Abedin to forward such emails to her outside unsecured email address (where they subsequently ended up on Anthony Weiner's notebook), is what this latest case will be all about and how it will be defended and prosecuted in the media, by the water coolers and perhaps, in court. However, we do know one thing: according to the NYT , the number of Huma emails that made their way to Weiner's PC was staggering: The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousand Which brings up two more critical questions: i) when she was questioned by the FBI over the summer, did Huma reveal and admit the existence of these ""thousands"" of emails located on a personal, home computer, and ii) will the FBI be able to comb through everything in the next 10 days ahead of the election? If the answer to the second question is no, will the US presidential election really take place with one candidate currently under FBI investigation, one which could potentially lead to impeachment proceedings within weeks or days of her being elected president? Still, the biggest irony in this latest debacle is that it was largely predicted by Donald Trump himself back in August of 2015. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. — Donald J.

119,"BERKELEY, Calif.  —   A vain politician runs for the presidency, short on specifics but long on bluster, inveighing against a religious minority and promising to make America prosperous again. Sound familiar? It did to the leaders of Berkeley Repertory Theater, who, casting about for a show to coincide with the fall presidential campaign, hit upon an idea: They would write a new adaptation of Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel imagining the election of an American demagogue: “It Can’t Happen Here. ” The play, which began previews on Friday, is among scores of efforts by theaters across the United States to provoke discussion and reflection about this year’s unusual election, and the unease that it has exposed. Some, like Berkeley Rep, explicitly aim to prompt discussion about Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has alarmed many in the   theater world others have opted to stage works in which characters grapple with issues debated during the campaign, like immigration or economic inequality. “Art shouldn’t fall into any kind of simplistic, didactic haranguing, and topicality is a dangerous thing, because you always get outstripped by reality,” said Tony Taccone, the longtime artistic director of Berkeley Rep, and a   with Bennett S. Cohen, of the new adaptation. However, he said, “With the election looming, it felt incumbent on us to respond if we could. ” On a recent afternoon, the cast and crew of “It Can’t Happen Here” gathered at Berkeley Rep’s administrative campus in a   warehouse once occupied by the North Face, to run through the play one last time before moving into a downtown Berkeley theater. The designers had embraced the    feel of a campaign: The set featured flags and drums and images of national parks, and the sound design included a Sousa march. Fourteen actors played nearly 50 roles, and practiced egging on the audience to cheer and jeer with the onstage pageantry. The theater printed     lapel stickers bearing the play’s name for patrons, meant to echo the ubiquitous “I Voted” stickers leaders considered, but decided against, holding a series of related discussion programs, thinking that the culture is already saturated with election talk. The play is scheduled to close Nov. 6, two days before the election. Around the country, theaters are acknowledging the election in various ways. On Broadway, “Kinky Boots” has created a video and website to promote voter registration, while “Hamilton” cast members are planning to register voters outside their theater on Wednesday and Saturday Off Broadway, “Avenue Q” has added Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump puppets to its company. Some theaters are staging Mike Daisey’s comedic monologue “The Trump Card,” while many others have brought back plays about political figures, from Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia to Lyndon Baines Johnson in Cleveland and Costa Mesa, Calif. In Washington, five prominent theaters are holding a series of free Monday night readings of politically themed plays, including “Ivanka: A Medea for Right Now,” a fictional work about Mr. Trump’s daughter by the playwright Joshua Harmon. Berkeley Rep hit upon “It Can’t Happen Here” about eight months ago, when an unexpected hole opened in its fall season. Lisa Peterson, who had signed on to direct a show for Berkeley Rep, Googled the phrase “it can’t happen here” and stumbled across the Sinclair Lewis novel, which she was not familiar with Mr. Taccone had read the book in high school and thought it would work. The novel is about a Vermont newspaper editor, Doremus Jessup, who opposes a demagogic presidential candidate, Berzelius Windrip it is a satirical and melodramatic cautionary tale, in which Mr. Windrip wins the election, imposes martial law and seizes control of newspapers his regime arrests and even kills his critics. Lewis, who had already won the Nobel Prize for literature, wrote the novel against an ominous backdrop: Hitler and Mussolini were in power in Germany and Italy, and Huey Long, a senator and former governor who wielded unusual power in Louisiana, was preparing to run for the American presidency. There are some striking similarities between the campaign pitches by the fictional Mr. Windrip and the real Mr. Trump  —   both men were even nominated for the presidency in Cleveland. But there are significant differences: Windrip, among other things, is a Democrat (in the novel, the Republican nominee winds up fleeing to Canada to plot a rebellion) and prone to warnings against Jews Mr. Trump, of course, is a Republican who has focused his concern on Muslims. In their new adaptation, Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen have sharpened the echoes. They wrote the campaign remarks by Windrip after watching stump speeches by Mr. Trump they have one of their characters comment on the role of the news media (“The more offensive his remarks, the more papers get sold”) and, in a dig at Hillary Clinton’s reference to some Trump supporters as belonging to a “basket of deplorables,” a character explaining Windrip’s popularity says, “It’s not because they’re all stupid and prejudiced and deplorable. ” The novel was first adapted into a play and presented around the country in the late 1930s by the Federal Theater Project  —   Lewis himself appeared in one production, in Cohasset, Mass. as the journalist Jessup. But Berkeley Rep deemed that adaptation unrevivable (“it’s ghastly,” said Susan Medak, its managing director) so Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen, with the blessing of the Lewis estate, set about writing a new one in unusually short time. “What we saw as the risk was that Trump would not make it through the primaries, and the piece would feel irrelevant,” Ms. Medak said. “But even if the elections ended up not being about Trump  —   and obviously we hoped they wouldn’t be  —   there was something about this that felt as though it was speaking to what the American public was concerned about, regardless of who the candidate was. ” Noting that the 1930s adaptation by Lewis and J. C. Moffitt was presented by multiple theaters around the country, Berkeley Rep this month invited theaters, universities and libraries across the country to hold readings of the play 30 organizations signed up in the first week. “It’s an outrageous story,” said Tom Nelis, the actor (last seen on Broadway in “The Visit”) portraying the journalist Jessup in Berkeley. “But you can’t watch it and not think it’s plausible. ” Had enough of CNN? Ready for politics with a dose of stage drama? Berkeley Rep’s new adaptation of “It Can’t Happen Here” is just one example of how theaters around the country have prepared programming to reflect the American presidential campaign. Some are mounting familiar works, from “Coriolanus” to “All the Way,” thinking that their themes will resonate especially strongly this fall others are focusing on new shows. Here are some examples: 45 PLAYS FOR 45 PRESIDENTS At the Merrimack Repertory Theatre in Lowell, Mass.

120,"Princeton University suspended the season of its men’s swimming and diving team after the discovery of material on its electronic mailing list that was “vulgar and offensive as well as misogynistic and racist,” the university said Thursday. A final decision whether to cancel the season will be made in the next few days, John D. Cramer, a university spokesman, said in an interview. The suspension came after an anonymous complaint made this week alerted officials to “several materials” that were offensive, including in electronic correspondence, the university said in a statement. Mr. Cramer would not discuss specifics of the other materials, including their content or when they were created, but confirmed that the comments were made about members of the women’s swimming and diving team. The suspension was the third of an Ivy League team since the start of November. Last month, Columbia and Harvard each suspended the season of a team after allegations of lewd behavior surfaced. Harvard canceled the rest of the season for its men’s soccer team after officials uncovered what they described as a widespread practice of players rating the school’s female players in sexually explicit terms. The Columbia wrestling team’s season was suspended while officials said they were investigating text messages sent by players that included the frequent use of racist, misogynistic and homophobic terms. At Princeton, the swimming and diving team, which has 38 members, was scheduled to compete on Jan. 7 against Navy and on Feb. 5 against Harvard and Yale. The Ivy League Championships will be Feb.  . “The behavior that we have learned about is simply unacceptable,” Mollie Marcoux Samaan, Princeton’s director of athletics, said in a statement. “It is antithetical to the values of our athletic program and of the university and will not be tolerated. ” The team was notified about the suspension on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cramer said. “I am deeply disappointed by the behavior of the men’s swim team,” Christopher L. Eisgruber, the university’s president, said in a statement. “I have asked the athletic department to redouble its efforts to ensure that our teams conduct themselves with the character and ethics that we expect from students representing Princeton University in athletic competition. ”",,371,18.55,20,0.3908355795148248,0,0,0,0,96.70755605580403,26.6037436358191,84.0786805288153,35.168214036138565,0.7870619946091644,0.0431266846361186,0.04043126684636118,0.016172506738544475,0.03234501347708895,0.05121293800539083,0.16711590296495957,0.005390835579514825,0,0.0215633423180593,0.1105121293800539,0,0.05929919137466307,0.0026954177897574125,0,0.016172506738544475,0.005390835579514825,0.0673854447439353,0,0.05390835579514825,0.018867924528301886,0.05390835579514825,0,0,0.0215633423180593,0.005390835579514825,0.09164420485175202,0,0,0,0.005390835579514825,0,0.01078167115902965,0.07008086253369272,0,0,0.444743935309973,0,0.0215633423180593,0,0.005390835579514825,0.0431266846361186,0.0026954177897574125,0,0.018867924528301886,0.01078167115902965,0.04851752021563342,0.013477088948787063,0.0026954177897574125,0.02425876010781671,0.005390835579514825,0.013477088948787063,0,0.0026954177897574125,0.01078167115902965,0.18059299191374664,0,0,0.0215633423180593,0.05929919137466307,0.11590296495956873,0.029649595687331536,0.018867924528301886,0.03234501347708895,0.14555256064690028,0.07277628032345014,0.008086253369272238,0,0.03234501347708895,0.1320754716981132,0.008086253369272238,0,0,0.0026954177897574125,0,0,0.0026954177897574125,0,0.12129380053908356,0.04043126684636118,0,0.0026954177897574125,0.013477088948787063,0.0673854447439353,0.11320754716981132,0.11320754716981132,0.01078167115902965,0.0862533692722372,0,3,0,41,7.45,1,0,0,46.625,11,21,0,0,10,0,3,0,23,0,75.625,98.625,23,,0.13043478260869565,0,0.6721311475409836,0.27140255009107467,0.047619047619047616,0,0,0.699812382739212,0.3548387096774194,0.5121951219512195,0,0,0.3333333333333333,0,0.3469387755102041,0,0.052317315894228035,0,0.17202160932613023,0.22433892522035825,-0.7881871748485728,0.7756610747796417,30
121,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Markets shook, the pound and euro dropped, and European leaders called emergency meetings after Britons unnerved the Continent by voting to leave the European Union. Exactly how the “Brexit” will unfold is unclear, but Prime Minister David Cameron said he was not the man to lead the country through it and will step down. Here’s a short rundown of the basics. _____ 2. Young people had made up one of the strongest blocs against leaving. “Truly gutted that our grandparents have effectively decided that they hate foreigners more than they love us and our futures,” one tweeted. Some Britons appeared confused about what they had done. Google reported a spike in searches for “What happens if we leave the E. U.?” as well as “What is the E. U.?”  Thousands of readers posted comments. One wrote: “I’m British, but I’m not sure what that means anymore. ” _____ 3. President Obama said Britain’s “special relationship” with the U. S. would endure. Donald Trump, whose political base voices the same kind of populist anger heard in Britain, forecast benefits to British business. He included his own Scottish golf resort, which he happened to be visiting. “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,” he said. _____ 4. Bernie Sanders commands a fearsome digital army, adept in social media, that captured more than $200 million in donations. Now he appears to be ready to drop his candidacy and shift his focus. “I’m going to do everything I can do to defeat Donald Trump,” he told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”  —   including vote for Hillary Clinton. _____ 5. Our movie reviewers have this to say about the this weekend’s big openings: “Independence Day: Resurgence” is a good bet only for those with an overwhelming love of    . “Swiss Army Man,” with Daniel Radcliffe as a corpse who makes Paul Dano’s life worth living, is “weird and wonderful, disgusting and demented. ” And “Free State of Jones” reconstructs a fascinating bit of Civil War history, with Matthew McConaughey leading a guerrilla army of white deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy. _____ 6. Mementos of Whitey Bulger’s gruesome career as a Boston mobster went up for auction, five years after he was convicted of 11 murder charges. There was his prized replica of a 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring and a   cup that he used as a pencil holder. The ring marked “1103” above is a sterling silver “Psycho Killer Skull” that he left in a London safe deposit box, along with $50, 000 cash, during his early years as a fugitive. _____ 7. More distress for the deeply troubled Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian laboratory set to handle drug testing was suspended for “nonconformity” with international standards. The lab can appeal, but for the moment, the World   Agency said it would send samples outside Brazil for testing. _____ 8. The swimmer Michael Phelps, now 30 and the most decorated athlete in Olympic history, is aiming for five Olympic berths in trials that begin Sunday. One of our   stories today traces his fall and his resurrection, starting at a treatment center in Arizona. His coach said: “He hid everything that makes him human for 12 years. The rehab is what opened him up. ” _____ 9. West Virginia deployed hundreds of National Guard members and struggled to restore power to thousands of people after storms pounded the state with as much as nine inches of rain over eight hours. At least 14 people were killed in what the National Weather Service called a “     event. ” _____ 10. Finally, as schools start their summer breaks, classroom animals are heading out too. Our reporter followed an exodus of gerbils, mice, corn snakes, turtles, rabbits, guinea pigs, geckos, and frogs  —   not to mention Lucy the chinchilla, above  —   in New York City alone. “You learn new things here,” one girl said of her teacher’s vanishing menagerie. “Like, you have to put vitamins on the mouse before you feed it to the snake. ” Have a great weekend! _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

122,"The F. B. I. interviewed Hillary Clinton on Saturday morning for its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state, a controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign and provided fodder for her political rivals. The voluntary interview, which took place over three and a half hours at the F. B. I. headquarters in Washington, largely focused on the Justice Department’s central question: Did the actions of Mrs. Clinton or her staff rise to the level of criminal mishandling of classified information? It could take weeks or longer to reach a decision, but news that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee, had been questioned in the J. Edgar Hoover Building three weeks before her party’s convention quickly reverberated. The Republican National Committee called the step “unprecedented,” while Mrs. Clinton’s expected opponent in the race for the White House, Donald J. Trump, wasted little time before weighing in. “It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “What she did was wrong!” The interview had been weeks in the making as law enforcement officials and Mrs. Clinton’s team coordinated schedules. Democrats also hoped that holding the interview on a holiday weekend might ease the anticipated storm. In a telephone interview with Chuck Todd on MSNBC after her meeting, Mrs. Clinton said, “I’ve been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion. ” Accompanying Mrs. Clinton into the meeting were her lawyer David E. Kendall Cheryl D. Mills and Heather Samuelson, longtime aides who are also lawyers and two lawyers from Mr. Kendall’s firm, Williams  Connolly, Katherine Turner and Amy Saharia. Eight officials from the F. B. I. and the Department of Justice conducted the interview, according to a person who was familiar with the substance of the session but declined to be named because the meeting was private. This person characterized the meeting as “civil” and “businesslike. ” Neither the campaign nor the F. B. I. would elaborate. Although the interview on Saturday was an important step toward closure on the email issue, technical analysis of the material remains to be done and could stretch on for an indeterminate period. The F. B. I. regularly interviews key figures before concluding an investigation, and such meetings are not an indication that it thinks the person broke the law. While defense lawyers often advise clients against such interviews, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has been eager for her to cooperate, lest she give her opponents additional ammunition. On Saturday, in a statement after the meeting, the Republican National Committee said that Mrs. Clinton “has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the F. B. I. as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct. ” Mrs. Clinton has struggled to get beyond the issue, which came to light last year during a   congressional investigation into the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. More than 30, 000 emails have since been made public. After spending much of last summer arguing she did not need to apologize for keeping a private server in her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. because the practice was allowed, Mrs. Clinton now frequently apologizes for the practice, saying it had been a mistake. The campaign has prioritized assisting the F. B. I. but it declined to cooperate with a State Department inspector general’s audit of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices. Those findings, delivered to members of Congress in May, undermined some of Mrs. Clinton’s initial statements defending her use of the server. The report said there was “no evidence” that she had requested or received approval for the server, despite having “an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business. ” Federal law deems it a crime to “knowingly” mishandle classified information outside secure government channels or to permit the practice through “gross negligence. ” None of the emails on Mrs. Clinton’s private server were marked classified at the time they were sent or received, but the Central Intelligence Agency later determined that some contained material that would be considered “top secret. ” Asked Saturday on MSNBC if she had broken the law, Mrs. Clinton repeated her defense: “I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified. ” There has been no indication that sensitive information was compromised by Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server. But it has fed a perception that she was trying to hide information, chipping away at data gauging her trustworthiness. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday found that voters deemed Mr. Trump more honest and trustworthy than Mrs. Clinton, 45 percent to 37 percent. “I have said that I’m going to continue to put forth my record, what I have stood for, do everything I can to earn the trust of the voters of our country,” she told MSNBC when asked about being seen as less trustworthy than Mr. Trump. “I know that’s something that I’m going to keep working on, and I think that’s, you know, a clear priority for me. ” Mrs. Clinton had no public events scheduled on Saturday, but after her F. B. I. interview she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, went to New York and saw the Broadway show “Hamilton. ” Mrs. Clinton’s meeting with the F. B. I. came amid controversy over a brief, unplanned meeting between Mr. Clinton and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch while both were at the Phoenix airport at the same time last week. To avoid any appearance of political meddling, Ms. Lynch said on Friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the F. B. I. director on whether to bring charges in the matter. She said she had made that decision several months ago, before the criticism surrounding her meeting with Mr. Clinton. She described the meeting with Mr. Clinton as a casual conversation that did not touch on the investigation. But it added to Clinton campaign staff members’ headaches over the email inquiry, which they had hoped to put behind them before the Democratic convention this month. “I certainly wouldn’t do it again,” Ms. Lynch said of the meeting with the  .",,1081,14.223684210526315,76,0.3524514338575393,0,0,0,0,93.09130752618381,24.376368331791554,77.87295713845205,38.96260584928485,0.81313598519889,0.011100832562442183,0.04440333024976873,0.014801110083256245,0.03515263644773358,0.012950971322849213,0.19518963922294172,0.0027752081406105457,0.0027752081406105457,0.018501387604070305,0.09065679925994449,0,0.0666049953746531,0.0027752081406105457,0,0.011100832562442183,0.0037002775208140612,0.08973172987974098,0.0018501387604070306,0.04810360777058279,0.02497687326549491,0.04625346901017576,0,0.0027752081406105457,0.027752081406105456,0.012025901942645698,0.1091581868640148,0.0009250693802035153,0.0009250693802035153,0.0009250693802035153,0.04810360777058279,0,0.005550416281221091,0.06475485661424607,0,0,0.4495837187789084,0.0009250693802035153,0.008325624421831638,0.0018501387604070306,0.02127659574468085,0.039777983348751156,0.010175763182238668,0.0018501387604070306,0.027752081406105456,0.009250693802035153,0.009250693802035153,0.0074005550416281225,0.010175763182238668,0.020351526364477335,0.012025901942645698,0.012950971322849213,0.010175763182238668,0,0.011100832562442183,0.19888991674375578,0,0,0.016651248843663275,0.09343200740055504,0.08603145235892692,0.05550416281221091,0.020351526364477335,0.07030527289546716,0.14246068455134134,0.09528214616096208,0.013876040703052728,0.0009250693802035153,0.03145235892691952,0.1332099907493062,0,0.008325624421831638,0.010175763182238668,0.0018501387604070306,0.0064754856614246065,0,0,0.02960222016651249,0.13598519888991675,0.060129509713228495,0,0.018501387604070305,0.0027752081406105457,0.058279370952821465,0.11378353376503238,0.12303422756706753,0.0009250693802035153,0.06938020351526364,0.0009250693802035153,40.85,0,62.730000000000004,1,16,5,10,28.03,11,49,14,9,24.1,0,40.85,0,89.85,15,133.03,233.88,89.85,,0.5116663857736072,0,0.6167099954624327,0.025008016707857707,0.2909769288510868,0.11366948956266174,0.2041350519664497,0.41825097827358854,0.22005643400399888,0.5568993285101511,0.2642148665478112,0.1875501017464369,0.38201106787719646,0,0.339056738914926,0,0.07211769993899893,0.01203968279449064,0.10677593347673932,0.18772273413169804,-0.6103344333386285,0.812277265868302,69
123,"Television networks ABC, CBS, and NBC have afforded nearly seven times more air time on  . Jeff Sessions meeting with a Russian ambassador than was spent when Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for withholding documents related to a House investigation, according to a newly released Media Research Center study. [These three mainstream media outlets devoted a combined 1 hour and 12 minutes over less than two days to the now former Senator Sessions’ two interactions with the Russian Ambassador. That coverage time was tabulated from just one set of evening and two sets of morning shows. During Senate confirmation hearings for his current position of U. S. Attorney General, Sessions responded to Sen. Al Franken’s questions about Trump campaign surrogates meeting with Russian officials by saying that as he was at times considered a surrogate for the campaign and did not meet with Russian officials.  MRC compared the Sessions’ coverage with coverage by these three networks of former Attorney General Holder on the day he became the first Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. Holder had refused to provide documents for the House investigation into the Obama Administration Fast and Furious gun running scandal. As a result, Holder was held in contempt on June 28, 2012. The grand total of combined airtime between the three networks on Holder being held in contempt of Congress garnered just 10 minutes and 38 seconds, according to MRC’s calculation. The morning of the vote to hold Holder in contempt, the three morning shows carried a combined 91 seconds of the story. That evening varied little, as only NBC carried the full story, but for only 2 minutes and 8 seconds. ABC and CBS carried just 35 seconds and 30 seconds, respectively, according to the MRC. The following morning, NBC was again the only network of the three to carry a full report at just 2 minutes, 50 seconds as well as short mentions of the story. ABC and CBS again carried merely short mentions of it. CBS led the pack on coverage of Sessions with 28 minutes and 42 seconds over the day and a half according to the MRC. NBC followed with 25 minutes and 12 seconds, while ABC spent 18 minutes and 39 seconds on the story. When compared, the three networks covered then Sen. Sessions meeting the Russian ambassador approximately 6. 8 times as much as they covered the unprecedented news that a Cabinet member, Holder, was held in contempt of Congress. Since the Sessions story broke, many Democrats have lodged weighty condemnation of Sessions’ meeting with the ambassador. Sessions contends that the meetings at the time were in his capacity as a Senator. Some of those Democrats, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, have since been challenged for meeting with Russian officials as well. What’s more, new details have surfaced that it was the Obama Administration State Department that sponsored a July 2016 event where Sessions met the Russian ambassador for the second time that year.

124,"Shouts of ‘Not my president!’ in California, following Trump victory 11/09/2016 PBS Moments after Donald Trump’s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton for the White House, protests erupted in California and other states, including people crying “Not my president!” The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets reported anti-Trump protesters amassing around the campuses of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego, among others. In Oakland, the overnight protests led to a partial closure of the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the Times reported. Photos and videos on social media captured the protesters marching and yelling “Who’s got the power? We got the power,” “Not my president!” and other anti-Trump chants filled with expletives . UCSB student newspaper the Daily Nexus reported that hundreds of students left their dorms to protest. In the video captured by the paper below, one student is seen carrying a Mexican flag. Likewise, hundreds of students at UC San Diego and UCLA demonstrated on campus early Wednesday morning. There also were reports of protests at UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine. Officials said there were as many as 3,000 students that marched through the UCLA campus, ABC reported . Elsewhere in the country, protests were reported in Portland, Oregon and Washington, D.C. In Oakland, authorities said dozens of protesters gathered downtown, while hundreds blocked a local highway. The San Francisco Chronicle also reported that a 20-year-old protester was severely injured after being hit by a car on Highway 20. Protesters had blocked the highway and lit several fires, officer John O’Reilly told BuzzFeed News .",,270,19.285714285714285,14,0.3851851851851852,0,0,0,0,96.89076109076109,45.81006647673314,44.114074074074075,1.715141612200436,0.7111111111111111,0.011111111111111112,0.02962962962962963,0.018518518518518517,0.02962962962962963,0.011111111111111112,0.2,0.022222222222222223,0,0.014814814814814815,0.08148148148148149,0,0.025925925925925925,0.007407407407407408,0.003703703703703704,0.003703703703703704,0,0.037037037037037035,0,0.07407407407407407,0.014814814814814815,0.05925925925925926,0.014814814814814815,0,0.02962962962962963,0,0.08518518518518518,0.011111111111111112,0,0,0,0,0,0.05185185185185185,0,0,0.3592592592592593,0.007407407407407408,0.014814814814814815,0.007407407407407408,0.011111111111111112,0.02962962962962963,0.003703703703703704,0,0.003703703703703704,0.003703703703703704,0.007407407407407408,0,0,0.018518518518518517,0.011111111111111112,0.02962962962962963,0.003703703703703704,0,0.040740740740740744,0.14814814814814814,0.007407407407407408,0,0.037037037037037035,0.04814814814814815,0.08888888888888889,0.018518518518518517,0,0.06296296296296296,0.13333333333333333,0.04814814814814815,0.007407407407407408,0.003703703703703704,0.025925925925925925,0.15925925925925927,0,0.018518518518518517,0,0.003703703703703704,0.022222222222222223,0,0,0,0.03333333333333333,0.08518518518518518,0,0.003703703703703704,0.003703703703703704,0.05555555555555555,0.05925925925925926,0.07037037037037037,0.003703703703703704,0.07777777777777778,0,11.73,0,64.46000000000001,0,0,0,27.73,0,7.83,8,0,18.46,0,6,11.73,0,33.75,27.73,73.19,105.94,33.75,,0.41211106907516637,0,0.7939088443205496,0,0,0,0.6236618072706015,0,0.3187695345408946,0.3234518715067226,0,0.5245331405396486,0,0.26393116059052896,0.36768039408986114,0,0.09589702790248338,0.07879183951809968,0.20796158436097062,0.30101721884412114,-0.7692283752760145,0.6989827811558789,24
125,"Joining us live during tonight’s debate was Walter F. Mondale, the 42nd vice president of the United States: Mr. Mondale chatted with us via emails sent from his home in Minneapolis, sharing his thoughts. (Check out how we covered the debate in real time:  analysis, highlights and fact checks.) Mr. Mondale, a Democrat, is credited with reshaping the vice presidency under President Jimmy Carter: Where past running mates were routinely relegated to obscurity, Mr. Mondale became an influential partner in government. A supporter of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Mondale agreed to size up Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and weigh in on the role of the vice presidency. (We also invited former Vice President Dick Cheney to join us, but a spokesman said he was unavailable.) ____ ALEXANDER BURNS, 9:05 P. M. Eastern: Mr. Mondale began by laying out the major questions of the night, as he sees them. WALTER MONDALE, 9:05: I hope you will open up the issue of what kind of vice presidency they are planning. Do they have an understanding about what they will do? What authority will he have? Do they have a clear understanding with their principal, or is it up in the air? I’m doubtful that Pence has an understanding. This is very important. VPs can get lost. ____ BURNS, 9:06: What do you see as the major goals of a   candidate in this setting? MONDALE, 9:06: One of the first and central issues is what will the VP do when he disagrees with the pres. candidate. Big, silent question. ____ BURNS, 9:10: Is there a “right” answer to that question? Did you have an explicit understanding with Carter? MONDALE, 9:10: No, only degrees of discomfort. I told Carter that I would not disclose deep differences unless I told Carter. Did he believe me? ____ BURNS, 9:26: These were supposed to be the   candidates! Are you surprised to see them going at each other so aggressively like this? MONDALE, 9:26: Yes, I hope this can let up a little bit. ____ BURNS, 9:36: Are you hearing anything significant from these two about how they would approach the vice presidency? Is there anything we can take away from their attitudes in the debate so far? MONDALE, 9:36: I’d try to break in on what their plans are for their vice presidency and whether they have an understanding with their principal. ____ BURNS, 9:38: To follow up: It seems like Mike Pence isn’t showing any daylight with Donald Trump. Does that tell you anything about his approach to the role? He didn’t even give ground on taxes. MONDALE, 9:38: It says he is locked in with Trump. This would be a good night to spell out differences. He’s not doing it. ____ MONDALE, 9:49: Pence is filibustering, paying no attention to fairness in time allocation. I wish Kaine would hit Pence far harder for his behavior. ____ BURNS, 9:59: I remember in your debate with Bob Dole, he was seen as too mean because of his comment about “Democrat wars. ” Does it ever amaze you that the tone of politics has gotten to this point? MONDALE, 9:59: Yes it does. ____ BURNS, 10:07: It kind of feels like we’re watching a debate between two pundits. What do you think voters need to know about a vice president, on a personal level, before that person comes into office? MONDALE, 10:07: What is the understanding, if any, about how the VP would serve the president? Do they have an agreement? Can the public be told? MONDALE, 10:07: I agree. We are not having the discussion that voters deserve. ____ BURNS, 10:15: It seems like we are getting a little more substance on foreign policy. Do you see Kaine as someone who can really advise Clinton in that area? He’s mostly talking about her record so far, not his own credentials. MONDALE, 10:15: I think the answer is yes. Kaine will be a big source of wisdom on policy and security issues. He’s on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. ____ BURNS, 10:16: Seems like we just saw the first real difference between Trump and Pence. Pence called Putin a “small and bullying leader”  —   Trump has said the exact opposite. Can the president and vice president take two dramatically different views of a country like Russia? MONDALE, 10:16: I don’t get it. It must be explained and I don’t think he can. Pence is off on his own. ____ BURNS, 10:23: So how tired do you get up on that stage, this far into a debate? Is it exhausting, or do you just feel the adrenaline the whole time? MONDALE, 10:23: Adrenaline sustained me. I paid a price later. ____ BURNS, 10:25: What do you think of the way these two are talking about nuclear weapons? This was a major issue in your presidential campaign. It’s such an important subject, but we don’t talk about it nearly as much anymore. MONDALE, 10:25: Kaine won that debate. Pence had nothing to say about this issue. ____ BURNS, 10:45: You mentioned on the phone earlier that the question of faith in politics is important to you. Is this, at least, a place where we saw these two candidates as people? Did anything they said really stand out to you? MONDALE, 10:45: Yes. I thought that discussion was more positive. ____ BURNS, 10:48: That was a rough debate. Thank you so much for speaking with us. One last question: Did we learn anything we really needed to know? MONDALE, 10:48: Not much. MONDALE, 10:48: I’m astonished that not one question was asked about how they saw the elements of the vice presidency.",,946,11.679012345679013,81,0.24947145877378435,0,0,0,0,64.49595624014229,16.33449612403101,86.42099457670741,49.36997885835095,0.8319238900634249,0.010570824524312896,0.039112050739957716,0.042283298097251586,0.0306553911205074,0.023255813953488372,0.3086680761099366,0.003171247357293869,0.0021141649048625794,0.014799154334038054,0.06659619450317125,0.005285412262156448,0.1014799154334038,0.006342494714587738,0.0010570824524312897,0.007399577167019027,0.008456659619450317,0.10887949260042283,0.0708245243128964,0.05919661733615222,0.02536997885835095,0.039112050739957716,0,0.0010570824524312897,0.02536997885835095,0.012684989429175475,0.09619450317124736,0.0010570824524312897,0,0.019027484143763214,0.0010570824524312897,0,0.012684989429175475,0.04439746300211417,0.0021141649048625794,0.0021141649048625794,0.5021141649048626,0.003171247357293869,0.010570824524312896,0.0010570824524312897,0.019027484143763214,0.06236786469344609,0.006342494714587738,0.0010570824524312897,0.040169133192389,0.0200845665961945,0.003171247357293869,0.02536997885835095,0.014799154334038054,0.008456659619450317,0.014799154334038054,0.008456659619450317,0,0,0.011627906976744186,0.25898520084566595,0.06448202959830866,0.0021141649048625794,0.042283298097251586,0.06448202959830866,0.05496828752642706,0.0919661733615222,0.021141649048625793,0.0507399577167019,0.12790697674418605,0.1543340380549683,0.011627906976744186,0.02536997885835095,0.006342494714587738,0.10042283298097252,0.0010570824524312897,0.013742071881606765,0.0021141649048625794,0.0010570824524312897,0.012684989429175475,0,0.0021141649048625794,0.021141649048625793,0.13530655391120508,0.06976744186046512,0.0010570824524312897,0.03171247357293869,0.016913319238900635,0.021141649048625793,0.16701902748414377,0.1744186046511628,0.015856236786469344,0.03699788583509514,0.019027484143763214,33.2,0,30.900000000000002,15.350000000000001,0,5,14,15.73,1.83,61.34999999999999,12.75,12,16.725,0,33.2,10,79.65499999999999,31.55,111.60499999999998,216.81000000000006,79.65499999999999,,0.4520129468361293,0,0.4342984847718442,0.2760829919463383,0,0.1104991335266339,0.2580682095013673,0.2809971091025644,0.04348939556521693,0.603843197114958,0.24056956187569054,0.22966848451216434,0.2935538028370584,0,0.25669804804522556,0.19900804996708035,0.07329247982628058,0.029029913232303715,0.10269044267167213,0.19949209153393885,-0.5288815778683009,0.8005079084660611,76
126,"by Yves Smith By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street Five years ago, when Google announced that it would build a super-high-speed fiber-optic network in Kansas City, and then roll it out in other cities, it started an effort to own and control the data pipelines going into homes and businesses. Given how frustrated consumers are with their ISPs, it seems people couldn’t wait for Google Fiber, now operated by Alphabet’s Access. Google then spent a fortune building out the network in select cities around the country. This could have been huge . At a huge cost. “Amazing bet,” is what Craig Barratt, senior VP at Alphabet and CEO of Access, called Google Fiber in a blogpost yesterday. In the same breath, he also announced that they would “pause” the build-out of Google Fiber in cities where it had been planned, that there would be layoffs and reassignments, though he didn’t say how many, and that he’d “step aside” as CEO of Access. His replacement has not been announced. He’s the third CEO of an Alphabet division to part ways since June. He prefaced this whole debacle this way: And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team, our business is solid: our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly, and we expect that growth to continue. I am extremely proud of what we’ve built together in five short years. Google Fiber is one of two big entities in “Other Bets” of the Alphabet empire, whose CEO Larry Page and new-ish CFO Ruth Porat are trying to crack down on ballooning costs. The other big entity in “Other Bets” is Nest Labs, which makes internet-connected thermostats and the like. In a brilliant move, Google had acquired it in 2014 for a breath-taking $3.2 billion. But by now, this move has become very unbrilliant. In June, Tony Fadell, Nest co-founder and CEO, quit after internal disputes over this focus on spending. Some key Nest employees moved to Google’s new hardware division. And the entity is in turmoil. In August, Bill Maris, CEO of Google’s venture capital arm, GV, also left. Earlier this year, Alphabet got second thoughts about its ambitious robotics efforts and put Boston Dynamics up for sale. It had acquired the experimental robot maker in 2013 for $500 million. But tensions soon arose, and co-founder Andy Rubin bailed out in 2014. No deal yet. Then there was, infamously, Google Glass…. So Google Fiber is in good company. It will cease efforts to install a fiber network in 10 cities where it had been planned but not fully committed, according to Ars Technica . In addition, San Francisco was supposed to get Google fiber for sure, but that has now been cancelled too. The 11 cities where Google Fiber has been nixed: Chicago, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Tampa. In “this handful of cities” and also “in certain related areas of our supporting operations, we’ll be reducing our employee base,” Barratt wrote. Hence the layoffs. Google Fiber has already been rolled out in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas), Nashville, Provo (Utah), Salt Lake City, and The Triangle (North Carolina). And it’s still publicly committed to building the network – subject to change, I suppose – in Huntsville (Alabama), Irvine (California), San Antonio, and Louisville. In June, Google Fiber announced that it would acquire Webpass, a 13-year-old company that provides high-speed wireless internet in Boston, Chicago, Miami, San Diego, Oakland, and San Francisco. A wireless network is a lot cheaper to install in urban areas with multi-family housing than fiber-to-the-home. About 9% of the employees at Access will lose their jobs, though some people could be reassigned to entities of Alphabet, according to Ars Technica: The source did not say exactly how many employees that percentage represents. Access includes more than just Google Fiber, so the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned is probably a little higher. Alphabet headcounts are hard to come by, but this Bloomberg report says Access has about 1,500 employees. The Information report indicates that Google Fiber had about 1,000 employees before the layoffs. If both of those numbers are accurate, then the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned to other parts of Alphabet might be around 13.5 percent. Google Fiber apparently has not hit its subscriber goals, and fiber construction is a costly endeavor. While the company isn’t giving up on fiber entirely, it may be able to deploy Internet service at a lower cost using wireless technology. “It’s billions of dollars a year just to maintain this stuff, and Google doesn’t want to spend that kind of money on just being another player in that market,” Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, told Bloomberg . “I think the new CFO put an end to the experiment that wasn’t really going anywhere,” Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless industry analyst, told Bloomberg . So serving up digital ads is still Alphabet’s main business, and flourishing. Controlling the high-speed pipeline to get these ads into homes and businesses, and grabbing whatever data can be grabbed by ISPs via deep-packet inspection and other methods still seems to be part of the plan, but now through cheaper and less glamorous wireless services and no longer through the holy grail of data pipelines, optical fiber. And so goes another huge dream to diversity away from advertising. Even the absolute master of marketing, Apple, is running into trouble with its latest product.

127,"Emily Bazelon writes in the New York Times on the shared vision of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the proper   role of the Justice Department. [From the New York Times:  One night in September 2014, when he was chief executive of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon hosted cocktails and dinner at the Washington townhouse where he lived, a mansion near the Supreme Court that he liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. Beneath elaborate chandeliers and flanked by gold drapes and stately oil paintings, Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, sat next to the guest of honor: Nigel Farage, the insurgent British politician, who first met Sessions two years earlier when Bannon introduced them. Farage was building support for his   party by complaining in the British press about “uncontrolled mass immigration. ” Sessions, like other attendees, was celebrating the recent collapse in Congress of bipartisan immigration reform, which would have provided a path to citizenship for some undocumented people. At the dinner, Sessions told a writer for Vice, Reid Cherlin, that Bannon’s site was instrumental in defeating the measure. Sessions read Breitbart almost every day, he explained, because it was “putting out   information. ” Bannon’s role in blocking the reform had gone beyond sympathetic coverage on his site. Over the previous year, he, Sessions and one of Sessions’s top aides, Stephen Miller, spent “an enormous amount of time” meeting in person, “developing plans and messaging and strategy,” as Miller later explained to Rosie Gray in The Atlantic. Breitbart writers also reportedly met with Sessions’s staff for a weekly happy hour at the Union Pub. For most Republicans in Washington, immigration was an issue they wished would go away, a persistent source of conflict between the party’s elites, who saw it as a straightforward economic good, and its   voting base, who mistrusted the effects of immigration on employment. But for Bannon, Sessions and Miller, immigration was a galvanizing issue, lying at the center of their apparent vision for reshaping the United States by tethering it to its European and Christian origins. (None of them would comment for this article.) That September evening, as they celebrated the collapse of the reform effort  —   and the rise of Farage, whose own   party in Britain represented the new brand of nativism  —   it felt like the beginning of something new. “I was privileged enough to be at it,” Miller said about the gathering last June, while a guest on Breitbart’s SiriusXM radio show. “It’s going to sound like a motivational speech, but it’s true. To all the voters out there: The only limits to what we can achieve is what we believe we can achieve. ” The answer to what they could achieve, of course, is now obvious: everything. Bannon and Miller are ensconced in the West Wing, as arguably the two most influential policy advisers to Donald J. Trump. And Jeff Sessions is now the attorney general of the United States. The genesis of their working relationship is crucial to understanding the   domestic goals of the Trump presidency and how the law may be used to attain them over the next four years. Bannon and Sessions have effectively presented the country’s changing demographics  —   the rising number of minority and   residents  —   as America’s chief internal threat. Sessions has long been an outlier in his party on this subject in 2013, when his Republican colleagues were talking primarily about curbing illegal immigration, he offered a proposal to curb legal immigration. (It failed in committee, 17 to one.) Read the rest here.

128,"Arnold Schwarzenegger won’t be back on NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice. [The    actor and former governor of California said Friday he would not return next season to helm the reality television show made popular by his predecessor and now president Donald Trump.  “I loved every second of working with NBC and Mark Burnett. Everyone  —   from the celebrities to the crew to the marketing department  —   was a straight 10, and I would absolutely work with all of them again on a show that doesn’t have this baggage,” Schwarzenegger told Empire magazine in an interview. “Even if asked [to do it again] I would decline,” he added. “With Trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don’t want to participate as a spectator or as a sponsor or in any other way support the show. It’s a very divisive period now and I think this show got caught up in all that division. ” Schwarzenegger took the helm of the reality show in January after NBC severed its business ties with Trump due to his presidential campaign. The rebooted show debuted to poor ratings and lackluster reviews, and the show struggled with ratings through the entirety of its   run. On Thursday, the Wrap reported that at least five of the show’s twelve corporate sponsors had decided to withdraw from participating in the show next season. The sponsors were reportedly targeted by a campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which boycotts brands and individuals associated with President Trump. Though Trump no longer hosted the show, he retained an executive producer credit and his name appeared in the titles. “When people found out that Trump was still involved as executive producer and was still receiving money from the show, then half the people [started] boycotting it,” Schwarzenegger told Empire. NBC has not yet announced whether it will bring back Celebrity Apprentice for next season.

129,"Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s    guide. We comb through releases big and small, famous and esoteric, to email readers twice a week with our timely recommendations. Our most recent suggestions also appear below. To receive our guide straight to your inbox, sign up here. I love a cop show. I love a doctor show. But the quickest way to entice me is for a show to have a unique setting or premise. That’s partially why “UnReal,” set within a reality show, and “Mr. Robot,” set among hacker activists, excite me so much, or shows like “Six Feet Under” and “Party Down” stay with me  —   they created and define my image of a funeral home and of a catering company. (Er   …     respectively.) This week, I’m spotlighting three shows that are, in significant ways, not like every other show. “Greenleaf” does something we relatively rarely on TV: It depicts religiosity. (The show’s creator Craig Wright has a background in theology.) The stars and creators of “Blackstone” are indigenous people  —   rarer still. And the chilly drama “Thirteen” is oriented around grief rather than horror. Hooray for anyone forging new paths. That’s also why I find myself wishing for stranger shows, and imaging oddball settings. I want a   soap set in the world of figure skating! Or an anthology like “In Treatment,” but where everyone has the same piano teacher, instead of the same therapist. Or a “Parks and Recreation,” but serious. A girl can dream. Lots to watch this week, and I hope you’ll share your secret dream setting for a TV show with me and Team Watching: watching@nytimes. com. “Greenleaf,” Tuesday, 10 p. m. with two more episodes Wednesday from 9 p. m. to 11 p. m. OWN Watch if you like “everybody has a secret” ensemble shows, stories about modern American Christianity and unusual workplace settings. “Greenleaf” is set within a black megachurch in Memphis and focuses on the Greenleaf family who runs the church and the prodigal daughter who has just returned to the fold after the mysterious death of her sister. There’s some contrived dialogue, and not all of the performances are at the same level. But the show is worth sticking with, particularly if you like twisty family stories that involve decades of resentment. The standout of the series is Keith David, who plays the family patriarch and bishop of the church. The scenes in which he preaches work better than most actual religious services I have attended. The members of his family and congregation say goodbye to one another by saying “God is good” and responding “all the time. ” I wish “Greenleaf” was good all the time, and it’s not quite, but it’s good some of the time, and features neither cops nor vampires, so I’m in for now. “Thirteen,” Thursday, 10 p. m. BBC America Watch if you like spooky foreign   and care more about the journey than the destination. Ivy Moxam (Jodie Comer of “My Mad Fat Diary”) was kidnapped as a teenager 13 years ago. Now she’s back. But what happened to her while she was gone? This     is less focused on being a whodunit and more concerned with Ivy’s emotional state and the unbearable weight her loved ones have carried around. It’s reminiscent of the French series “Les Revenants” (which has a supernatural element, unlike “Thirteen”) and is much more on the uncanny side of scary than the horror side. “Blackstone,” Hulu  Watch if you like bleak, unglamorous and distinctive ensemble shows.  “Blackstone” is one of the flagship shows of Canada’s Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, where it made its debut in 2011. It’s set on a (fictional) Blackstone First Nation reserve, within an indigenous community challenged by corruption and desperation. The depths of that corruption start coming to light when Leona (Carmen Moore) wins the election to become the new chief, though her victory celebration is overshadowed by a teenager’s rape and suicide. In its earliest episodes, the series’ dialogue is   and the camera distractingly jumpy. But stick with it: The story is powerful enough to outweigh early shortcomings, and around Episode 5, the show blossoms into itself, and it’s well worth the wait. The first three seasons, with 23 total episodes, are currently on Hulu. (Seasons 4 and 5 have already aired in Canada.) • Monday: “The Fosters,” Season 4 premiere, 8 p. m. Freeform. Last season was not my favorite, but this show is so good that even its crummy episodes are better than other show’s good ones. • Tuesday: “The Greeks,” series premiere, 9 p. m. PBS. This is a   documentary series about ancient Greece, beginning with how cave people eventually formed societies. Thorough! • Wednesday: “Big Brother,” Season 18 premiere, 8 p. m. CBS. I hate “Big Brother,” but in my experience many otherwise   people secretly love it. I know you’re out there, Watchers. No judgment. • Thursday: “Queen of the South,” series premiere, 10 p. m. USA. Based on Arturo  ’s book “La Reina Del Sur” (already adapted as a popular Mexican show) “Queen” follows a Mexican drug queenpin who winds up fleeing to the United States. Some of it feels like other, tenser dramas, but the pilot has promise. • Friday: “Comedy Bang! Bang! ,” 11:30 p. m. IFC. Nathan Fielder, of “Nathan For You,” is the guest, so it’ll be a real bonanza of comedy oddness. Game of Thrones: This season’s penultimate episode  —   like those of many previous seasons  —   was  . The “Battle of the Bastards,” between the forces of Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton, was a spectacle. As Jeremy Egner writes, “Whether you actually slept well Sunday night probably depends on your tolerance for blood, guts, dead giants and other hallmarks of grim medieval battle, as presented in the tense, grimy and at times oddly beautiful clash. ” More Game of Thrones: At Hitfix, Alan Sepinwall wonders why he was “so unmoved” by it all. “No show in TV history has ever done spectacle on this level, as consistently well as ‘Game of Thrones’ has,” he writes. “But the show at its best finds a way for the characterization to be as powerful as the visuals, and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ ultimately didn’t manage to surround all those stunning battle images with enough emotional meat to make it all worth it. ” Or try this Joanna Robinson piece at Vanity Fair about Sansa’s decisions in the episode. Outlander: “Game of Thrones” wasn’t the only show to allow its characters a measure of vengeance. “Mary and Claire get revenge,” Angelica Jade Bastién writes of Saturday’s episode of “Outlander,” “but the show doesn’t fully wrestle with what this means for either of them going forward. ” Veep: Eight episodes of Catherine standing in the corner with a video camera finally pays off. As Noel Murray writes, “Kissing Your Sister” is “an offbeat episode that both summarizes and comments on everything that’s happened so far in Season 5. It’s a conceptual tour de force  —   and, more important, it’s very, very funny. ” Silicon Valley: “This seems like an odd question to ponder nearly three full seasons into ‘Silicon Valley,’” Scott Tobias writes. “But it’s worth asking: What exactly is Pied Piper anyway?”",,1215,13.351648351648352,91,0.31522633744855966,0,0,0,0,84.48474286834075,29.55044699872287,60.08246280468502,55.235720164609056,0.7860082304526749,0.013991769547325103,0.05267489711934156,0.04526748971193416,0.053497942386831275,0.02633744855967078,0.2707818930041152,0.00905349794238683,0.00411522633744856,0.02880658436213992,0.0757201646090535,0,0.056790123456790124,0.012345679012345678,0.00411522633744856,0.009876543209876543,0.01316872427983539,0.09218106995884774,0.012345679012345678,0.06337448559670782,0.03539094650205761,0.06995884773662552,0,0.00411522633744856,0.03950617283950617,0.00905349794238683,0.07325102880658436,0.0032921810699588477,0.007407407407407408,0.0016460905349794238,0.009876543209876543,0.0008230452674897119,0.007407407407407408,0.01810699588477366,0.0008230452674897119,0.0008230452674897119,0.43703703703703706,0.0032921810699588477,0.0016460905349794238,0.00411522633744856,0.01646090534979424,0.05102880658436214,0.005761316872427984,0.0024691358024691358,0.013991769547325103,0.013991769547325103,0.023868312757201648,0.006584362139917695,0.00411522633744856,0.010699588477366255,0.00905349794238683,0.01810699588477366,0,0.0032921810699588477,0.02551440329218107,0.21563786008230454,0.00905349794238683,0.006584362139917695,0.03374485596707819,0.07242798353909465,0.05185185185185185,0.040329218106995884,0.03374485596707819,0.03374485596707819,0.12921810699588476,0.09135802469135802,0.02880658436213992,0.0016460905349794238,0.07325102880658436,0.12510288065843622,0.00823045267489712,0.009876543209876543,0.0008230452674897119,0.0016460905349794238,0.02962962962962963,0,0.0008230452674897119,0.00823045267489712,0.07818930041152264,0.060082304526748974,0.0016460905349794238,0.023045267489711935,0.0016460905349794238,0.05843621399176955,0.10452674897119342,0.09794238683127572,0.00411522633744856,0.01316872427983539,0.009876543209876543,66.1,21.214375,74.7,1,1,38.95,31.73,32.45,1.83,70.75,16.45,22.975,58.475,0,66.1,0,203.294375,91.50500000000001,194.9,473.249375,203.294375,,0.6077520585522009,0.33211895639598693,0.6364951600226031,0.02290349533557069,0.02290349533557069,0.4772614158253208,0.4265274649332745,0.4320246318923205,0.04113149088902522,0.6238346745387139,0.27828784050147276,0.3500341227219847,0.5781792357321259,0,0.5719362443121233,0,0.13046331239503947,0.05872294991294318,0.12507625745076908,0.3037058012617525,0.2176931655629327,0.6962941987382475,130
130,"Do we know what we’re talking about when we talk about design? Design is both noun and verb, covering work that ranges from the composition of a tattoo to the amelioration of climate change. We design spoons and rooms, houses and cities, power grids and national identities, international treaties and defense systems and, when all else fails, military campaigns. If design refers to that which is planned and brought to fruition by human ingenuity, we’ve reached the point where, as Mark Wigley and Beatriz Colomina, curators of this year’s Istanbul Design Biennial, aptly observe, “the planet itself has been completely encrusted by design as a geological layer. ” Even the few undesigned places left exist because we design the borders around them. The basic motivation for design is the very human desire for coherence. With so much designed in the world, we begin to take its results for granted. Often, what we have conjured assumes the sheen of inevitability, as if its results were inalienable facts in the world rather than the product of someone’s ideas and actions. In other words, design solidifies, and naturalizes, things that start off as opinions, stories and traditions, supplying form to the fictions by which we live. We rarely stop to consider the   proposition represented by our paper money or the imagined national narratives engendered by borders. Unlike words, the meaning of which can be debated, the objective materiality of designed objects exudes a unique power. Once established, it’s difficult to think outside the systems and structures these objects represent. Consider the current public bathroom kerfuffle. Recently, several states have introduced legislation that would compel citizens to confine themselves to the bathrooms that align with the sex designated on their birth certificate. So one designed system, the binary “M” or “F” box on the birth certificate, is used to justify another: men’s and women’s bathrooms. Never mind that we’re perfectly comfortable sharing unisex bathrooms at home, in trains and on airplanes  —   the male or female designation, at least in most public spaces, is taken as  . That division of bathrooms, however, is a historical relic. As women began to enter the industrialized work force in the 19th century, employers started to segregate bathrooms, ostensibly to protect delicate sensibilities. Over the course of the next 150 years, this division of the sexes, which had begun as a product of ideology, was legally codified. Now, building codes and the Americans with Disabilities Act stipulate detailed requirements for how public bathrooms must be designed, and architects are required by law to follow them. As the origin story fades into the past, the presence of the two distinct spaces is cited as proof that the difference they identify is sacrosanct, when in fact the twin rooms are, essentially, architecturally codified ideology. In 2013, after California passed the law guaranteeing any public school student the right to use the bathroom facility they felt aligned with their gender identity, a Republican state assemblyman withdrew his    son from school, declaring: “The public schools are no longer interested in education. They’ve become   centers. ” His mistake was in not recognizing that all design is indoctrinating, because design manifests the distinctions by which we order our world. The overheated rhetoric spinning around the bathroom debate claims we are creating a “recipe for disaster” by entering “unknown territory. ” But this territory is hardly unexplored it’s just that a century and a half of architecture, icons and ideology has done its work. Now change seems unimaginable, even dangerous, despite the fact we designed it that way in the first place. What seems   can no longer be imagined as arbitrary. It’s only when our belief systems shift, and culturally we experience a seismic disruption, that we suddenly recognize the underlying fictions on which our designed world is built. Design always depicts the things that matter to us . .. until they don’t.",,653,22.517241379310345,29,0.38437978560490044,0,0,0,0,84.24273629819463,34.01149490480782,79.58201463331632,28.318989280245024,0.776416539050536,0.013782542113323124,0.0444104134762634,0.042879019908116385,0.019908116385911178,0.03522205206738132,0.16845329249617153,0,0,0.018376722817764167,0.08728943338437979,0,0.06125574272588055,0.004594180704441042,0,0.026033690658499236,0.022970903522205207,0.11944869831546708,0.0030627871362940277,0.07656967840735068,0.02909647779479326,0.07044410413476264,0,0,0.026033690658499236,0.010719754977029096,0.08269525267993874,0,0.0015313935681470138,0.0015313935681470138,0.004594180704441042,0,0,0.026033690658499236,0,0,0.4670750382848392,0.0015313935681470138,0,0.019908116385911178,0,0.05972434915773354,0,0.0015313935681470138,0.03215926493108729,0.022970903522205207,0.013782542113323124,0.007656967840735069,0.0015313935681470138,0.01225114854517611,0.007656967840735069,0.009188361408882083,0,0,0.01225114854517611,0.18989280245022971,0.0015313935681470138,0,0.006125574272588055,0.04900459418070444,0.05972434915773354,0.04900459418070444,0.010719754977029096,0.021439509954058193,0.13476263399693722,0.10872894333843798,0.015313935681470138,0.0015313935681470138,0.018376722817764167,0.14088820826952528,0.0015313935681470138,0.006125574272588055,0.010719754977029096,0.0015313935681470138,0.0015313935681470138,0,0.0015313935681470138,0.0030627871362940277,0.08422664624808576,0.07503828483920368,0,0.026033690658499236,0.013782542113323124,0.05053598774885146,0.10566615620214395,0.0995405819295559,0.03215926493108729,0.036753445635528334,0,18,0,9,0,8,0,21.25,9,2,20,0,11,9,0,18,6,38,30.25,42,105.25,38,,0.42772423764266654,0,0.27204148781214693,0,0.2493517698850324,0,0.4687514907925844,0.27204148781214693,0.07667774013050205,0.45368768417606564,0,0.31354048090072006,0.27204148781214693,0,0.29339977411634566,0.19944693923806533,0.05203697363916467,0.04142416980486135,0.05751454981170832,0.14412872304005478,-0.19021001994053138,0.8558712769599452,28

132,"Lt. Gen. (Ret.) William G. “Jerry” Boykin, Family Research Council’s executive vice president, strongly denounced President Barack Obama’s plan to free Chelsea Manning in a Wednesday interview on Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM radio with hosts Alex Marlow and Raheem Kassam. [As Breitbart reported Tuesday:  President Barack Obama announced his plan to free Chelsea Manning (who changed his name from Bradley) after leaking classified military documents to WikiLeaks and being sentenced to 35 years in prison for his crimes. Once in prison, Manning went on a hunger strike to demand sex change surgery in prison, which was granted by officials at the cost of American taxpayers. Boykin said, “I think what Manning did and was caught at   …     was every bit as egregious and damaging as what [Edward] Snowden did. ” In arguing against Obama’s plan to set Manning free, Boykin added, “Both of these guys are enemies of the state, plain and simple. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

133,"An armed Dakota Access security contractor confronted indigenous water protectors fighting the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. He had an assault rifle, which he pointed at the water protectors, and he wore a bandana over his face. He was arrested by the Bureau of Indian Affairs police and later released without charge.In video aired by “Democracy Now!”, as host Amy Goodman described, the man carrying the rifle, who has been identified as Kyle Thompson, points a rifle “at the protectors as he attempts to flee into the water.”“A Standing Rock Sioux tribal member says he saw the man driving down Highway 1806 toward the main resistance camp with an AR-15 rifle on the passenger side of his truck,” Goodman reported. “Protectors chased down his truck and then pursued him on foot in efforts to disarm him.”“Protectors said inside the man’s truck they found a DAPL security ID card and insurance papers listing his vehicle as insured by DAPL. That’s the Dakota Access pipeline,” according to Goodman.Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, witnessed the encounter between the armed contractor and water protectors. He said on “Democracy Now!”:It was a very terrifying moment for a lot of us watching, I mean, to see this man pulling an assault rifle at our water protectors. And I think that—many blessings and gratitude to some of the military veterans within our security, from within our Oceti Sakowin camp, who stepped up to negotiate and to de-escalate this man, to really talk to him to make sure that he did not hurt anybody, until the Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers could show up.Thompson appeared on the scene about the same time that hundreds of police with militarized equipment surrounded a newly formed camp called the 1851 Treaty Camp, which was setup by water protectors to reclaim “unceded Dakota territory affirmed as part of the Standing Rock Reservation in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851.”Sacred Stone Camp, which has led indigenous resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline, reported that police cleared blockades, attacked water protectors with pepper spray and concussion grenades, and used shotguns to fire rubber bullets. A sound cannon was also deployed against water protectors as well, as the police brutally tore down the encampment.Dakota Access denies Thompson was working for the company, however, Thompson posted on Facebook and claimed he was “doing his job to photograph burning company equipment when he was confronted by demonstrators,” according to APTN National News .The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe apparently claims Thompson fired off shots while Thompson vehemently denies that any shots were ever fired. He maintains FBI agents, who took him into custody, could back up his story.However, Thompson’s story becomes incredibly suspicious, as he insists the water protectors “had knives and were dead set on using those knives.” He says a water protector fired a flare.The video of Thompson’s confrontation in the water definitely does not show any knife-wielding water protectors trying to attack him.What is troubling is the fact that he was not dressed in a manner that would clearly indicate he was a security contractor for DAPL. He looked like an infiltrator. One wonders what would have happened if he made it to the 1851 Treaty Camp and engaged in disruptive behavior that the police could then use to justify the brute force used against water protectors.It is unknown what company Thompson worked for, but he was previously deployed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Separately, another suspicious act against the indigenous water protectors occurred overnight on October 29, when a fire spread near the Oceti Sakowin camp.“There was some mysterious incident of a vehicle that came out of nowhere, that was almost acting as a distraction, was spinning doughnuts in the middle of the road, and then it sped off to the south,” Goldtooth shared on “Democracy Now!”. “And immediately after that, flames were seen on top of the hill to the west. There’s documented footage [of] what appears to be a drip line, which is from what I understand, is a technique used in firefighting. I mean, it was very, very clear that that brush fire that happened was an act of arson by unknown individuals.”“Given the recent events with the Dakota Access worker, given the escalation of law enforcement, that, you know, a lot of fingers are pointing towards Dakota Access as being a culprit behind this late fire. And thank god that the wind was pushing away from the camp. The fire spread pretty large.”The post Armed Dakota Access Contractor Accused Of Trying To Infiltrate Water Protectors appeared first on Shadowproof .",,793,41.73684210526316,19,0.3455233291298865,0,0,0,0,93.94269478187303,5.172598197188361,71.90252206809583,16.71853720050441,0.7641866330390921,0.01008827238335435,0.034047919293820936,0.029003783102143757,0.0403530895334174,0.011349306431273645,0.15132408575031525,0.012610340479192938,0.0037831021437578815,0.006305170239596469,0.09583858764186633,0,0.05674653215636822,0.02395964691046658,0.005044136191677175,0.012610340479192938,0.008827238335435058,0.08196721311475409,0.0012610340479192938,0.05674653215636822,0.021437578814627996,0.04918032786885246,0.0037831021437578815,0.0025220680958385876,0.01639344262295082,0.007566204287515763,0.09583858764186633,0.0037831021437578815,0,0.011349306431273645,0,0,0.0037831021437578815,0.0617906683480454,0,0,0.46532156368221944,0,0.006305170239596469,0,0.006305170239596469,0.05044136191677175,0.0012610340479192938,0.018915510718789406,0.01639344262295082,0.017654476670870115,0.007566204287515763,0.04287515762925599,0.0012610340479192938,0.011349306431273645,0.006305170239596469,0.02269861286254729,0,0.0012610340479192938,0.011349306431273645,0.19041614123581338,0.0037831021437578815,0,0.03656998738965952,0.04287515762925599,0.04918032786885246,0.05044136191677175,0.01639344262295082,0.03909205548549811,0.15384615384615385,0.1008827238335435,0.011349306431273645,0,0.03278688524590164,0.11727616645649433,0.0037831021437578815,0.01008827238335435,0.027742749054224466,0.0012610340479192938,0.017654476670870115,0,0,0.03656998738965952,0.0807061790668348,0.07440100882723834,0,0.025220680958385876,0.0012610340479192938,0.031525851197982346,0.10718789407313997,0.11727616645649433,0.005044136191677175,0.034047919293820936,0.0012610340479192938,6.73,0,101.92000000000002,0,6,9.46,0,3,1.73,90.98750000000001,50.5625,10.5,13.46,0,6.73,0,81.98249999999999,9.46,167.17749999999995,254.15999999999994,81.98249999999999,,0.25663916863767955,0,0.8394447532602681,0,0.23535329109798714,0.3267297916472832,0,0.13337133711281343,0.0815130761013228,0.8235572357149503,0.7217431196311306,0.35007481460978035,0.4084532378787804,0,0.3093157321702091,0,0.08263032172230285,0.009534752459280761,0.16849852846315105,0.2561683599419448,-0.8607377124161426,0.7438316400580551,55
134,"STAFF NEWS & ANALYSIS If Trump Wants to Fix the ‘Disaster’ of the Pentagon, He Should Clean Up Its Nuclear Lies   Trump Versus the Pentagon … On the campaign trail, Trump called the military a “disaster” … He pledged to vastly increase the sizes of the Army and Marines and to buy scores of new ships and planes. Does that make sense? – Bloomberg We’ll answer Bloomberg’s question: No it doesn’t make sense. America doesn’t need a bigger military anymore than it needs a bigger prison system. The American military is many ways a fraud. The idea is that if it were smaller, America itself would somehow be overrun by “enemies.” Do you believe it? America’s military services, like its intelligence agencies, are actually in the service of London’s banking elite. The US military is used to reshape the world in order to make it more congenial to one-world government from what we can tell. America’s military power has little if anything to do with actually defending the country. The Pentagon is rife with corruption. It has recently mislaid something like $8 trillion and has also, obviously, participated in a 9/11 coverup. This is the facility that Trump wants to lavish more trillions on. More: Instead of adding regular troops and ships, the military should get granular, focusing on special forces, unmanned technology like drones, cyberdefense, and a naval strategy of “distributed lethality” that emphasizes firepower and self-defense across the current fleet. The generals will gladly take the additional money he’s promising, but will follow their own priorities. This is absolutely correct. The Pentagon’s generals will do as they please. They listen to London long before they listen to the White House. The Pentagon wants trillions for a nuclear upgrade. This is a bad joke. We’ve written numerous articles on how the Pentagon’s nuclear program was fraudulent from the very beginning. You can see some of them here, here and here . The Pentagon basically only allowed one journalist to cover the creation and completion of the original nuclear program, and that person – a New York Times reporter – was also on the Pentagon payroll. Whatever was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the way of a “nuclear” bomb was also accompanied very obviously by fire-bombing. The damage to Hiroshima and Nagasaki looks no different than the damage to Tokyo, which was lavishly firebombed. We’ve even identified the 66 bombers that likely bombed Hiroshima on August 6 th (666). The fleet was initially sent to a city near Hiroshima that had already been bombed several times. No, there’s no way those bombers bombed the same city yet again. Those bombers fire-bombed Hiroshima. Or course the tale of the bombings was not told at the time. Instead, the US military shut down all access in and out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a full month. And then both Japan and the US made it a capital offense to talk about the bombings, to say or write anything at all, unless it was approved. If Trump really wants to create a better and more efficient military, he can start by getting to the bottom of the fakery of the Pentagons’ nuclear program. Parts of the program may indeed be real, but a lot of the narrative surrounding Hiroshima and Nagasaki is false. Also false are the videos and pictures of nuclear explosions provided to the public by the Pentagon throughout the ‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s. The Pentagon has actually admitted that every single one of these presentations was “touched up” by its Hollywood special effects department. And were massive amounts of TNT present at many of these “tests?” Could the Pentagon have been faking some of these explosions? Who vouches for the Pentagon’s nuclear program? The same elements of the military-industrial complex that has lied and faked portions of the nuclear program in the past? Who is present at the “tests” that the Pentagon performs? Just military types? Who vouches for the truth of what the Pentagon builds and tries out? The Pentagon reports regularly to Congress and the media about its “progress.” But does anyone check what the Pentagon is asserting? Does anyone actually investigate? The Pentagon can’t tell you what it did with $8 trillion but for some reason the words of its generals and others involved in the military-industrial complex are taken at face value. Conclusion: If Trump really wants to make America’s military more efficient, he could aim a reportorial truth squad to sort through at least a half century of lies and misinformation.

135,"Former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos declared that he would “make sure” UC Berkeley would “become the free speech capital of the United States once again” in response to the cancellation of Ann Coulter’s event on campus. [“Awful to see my friend Ann Coulter forced to cancel her speech,” wrote Milo on his official Facebook page. “I don’t understand why Young America’s Foundation would capitulate so close to victory. Ann can hardly be expected to show up without insurance, security or a venue, so I completely understand why she had to cancel. She is Ann Coulter, after all. ”  “My proposed Free Speech Week will proceed as planned later this year,” he continued, before adding, “I WILL BRING AN ARMY IF I HAVE TO. ” “We will ensure that Ann and others can speak and we will publicly, ritually humiliate UC Berkeley for its failure to meet its legal obligations until conservative speakers no longer fear violent mobs just for exercising their First Amendment rights,” Milo concluded. “Berkeley is going to become the free speech capital of the United States once again. I will make sure of it. ” Like Coulter, Milo’s event at UC Berkeley earlier this year was derailed after a mob of violent   activists set fires, smashed windows, and assaulted attendees who were supposed to see him speak. Young America’s Foundation pulled out of the Ann Coulter event on Tuesday, blaming the college’s hostile environment towards conservatives. However, YAF and the UC Berkeley College Republicans are still in the process of suing the college, claiming that administrators put several limiting restrictions on the event in an effort to get it cancelled. The groups and their attorney Harmeet Dhillon referenced previous events featuring conservative speakers at the college which also faced similar scrutiny and restrictions, including Milo’s as well as conservative commentator David Horowitz. During a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday, Dhillon branded UC Berkeley’s policies on “acceptable speech” as “infinitely malleable” before criticizing the Mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin, for appearing to sympathize with, be friendly to, and act softly on the   rioters who shut down Yiannopoulos’ event earlier this year. “If the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that’s a serious public health issue,” Dhillon proclaimed.

136,"  Paul Joseph Watson Bureaucrat who said “stupidity” of Americans helped get law passed doubles down Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the “fix” for Obamacare was to impose a “larger mandate penalty”. CNN’s CAROL COSTELLO: “So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?” JONATHAN GRUBER: “Look, once again, there’s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty“… Gruber’s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. “ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,” points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool “stupid” Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law’s “lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage” in selling it.",,288,20.571428571428573,14,0.3680555555555556,0,0,0,0,76.65392015392015,9.679221594475834,69.88690476190476,25.774193548387096,0.7638888888888888,0.017361111111111112,0.05555555555555555,0.052083333333333336,0.04861111111111111,0.006944444444444444,0.1840277777777778,0.013888888888888888,0.003472222222222222,0.020833333333333332,0.06944444444444445,0.003472222222222222,0.08680555555555555,0.003472222222222222,0,0.010416666666666666,0.010416666666666666,0.11805555555555555,0.006944444444444444,0.020833333333333332,0.027777777777777776,0.034722222222222224,0,0,0.013888888888888888,0.034722222222222224,0.09027777777777778,0,0,0,0.003472222222222222,0,0,0.03819444444444445,0,0,0.4444444444444444,0.003472222222222222,0.006944444444444444,0,0.010416666666666666,0.06597222222222222,0.003472222222222222,0,0.041666666666666664,0.017361111111111112,0.010416666666666666,0.003472222222222222,0.017361111111111112,0.017361111111111112,0.017361111111111112,0.024305555555555556,0,0,0.020833333333333332,0.2708333333333333,0.017361111111111112,0.003472222222222222,0.017361111111111112,0.04861111111111111,0.0625,0.03819444444444445,0.024305555555555556,0.059027777777777776,0.11805555555555555,0.10416666666666667,0.013888888888888888,0.003472222222222222,0.0625,0.1076388888888889,0,0.010416666666666666,0.003472222222222222,0.003472222222222222,0.006944444444444444,0,0,0.006944444444444444,0.07291666666666667,0.059027777777777776,0,0.006944444444444444,0,0.027777777777777776,0.14583333333333334,0.1736111111111111,0.006944444444444444,0.03819444444444445,0.013888888888888888,13,0,25,0,0,0,6.5,23,0,12,13.1,0,9,0,13,12,35.1,18.5,54,107.6,35.1,,0.4372216837735103,0,0.5990434398056875,0,0,0,0.2797720439513347,0.5788609951579327,0,0.4176353409424863,0.43910809993475225,0,0.34974273756851054,0,0.15202805015514587,0.4176353409424863,0.09653465346534654,0.050880088008800874,0.1485148514851485,0.2959295929592959,-0.6149909497667443,0.7040704070407041,32
137,"MarcFaberBlog.com November 1, 2016 It’s nonsense to claim that inflation is only going up 1 percent per year in the United States. The cost of living of a typical family is going up much more than that—insurance, transportation, schooling are all going up. For example, health care premiums for insurance policies [are rising], so the typical household is being squeezed. The central banks don’t care about that; they don’t look at it.. I suppose the system will collapse before we become like Venezuela. In the West, if they start to print money, the end game will be brief. Within five years, I expect the system to implode. You better ask the bureaucrats what their plans are. They had zero rates since December 2008; soon eight years [passed], and that hasn’t boosted economic activity for the average household, not in Japan nor the United States nor the EU. Now they talk about fiscal spending. You better ask the bureaucrats what their plans are. They had zero rates since December 2008; soon eight years [passed], and that hasn’t boosted economic activity for the average household, not in Japan nor the United States nor the EU. Now they talk about fiscal spending. Then they will find some academics who will blame wealth inequality on the evil capitalists who made so much money out of asset bubbles. They will blame the economic woes on these people. To some extent this is true. But the rich people did not create the inflated asset values; it was the central banks, by slashing interest rates to zero and negative interest rates in many countries. First, you create mispricings through artificially low rates and negative interest rates and you boost the income and wealth of the super-rich. It’s at best the 0.1 percent that really benefit from asset inflation, at the cost of all the people that have no assets and so you have this rising wealth inequality. So we have to tax the rich people and tax them more. Taking money from the rich is appealing if you go to voters, and you say to them, “Look, the reason the economy is doing so badly, it’s because of the rich people, the billionaires. We have to take 20 percent away from them and give it to you.” You can be sure that everybody will vote for that because the wealthy are a minority. This is what happens after monetary policies completely fail. Some well-connected people will hide their wealth but a lot of people won’t. Even if they take 50 percent from the richest, it’s not going to help. The next step will be to take money from less wealthy people; the interventionists will go all the way. - Source, The Epoch Times",,468,17.333333333333332,27,0.2606837606837607,0,0,0,0,70.37552103069345,21.36919725155019,69.6007326007326,94.42877492877493,0.8782051282051282,0.021367521367521368,0.053418803418803416,0.03632478632478633,0.07478632478632478,0.01282051282051282,0.16452991452991453,0.004273504273504274,0,0.019230769230769232,0.0876068376068376,0,0.09615384615384616,0.004273504273504274,0,0.019230769230769232,0.014957264957264958,0.09188034188034189,0,0.04700854700854701,0.023504273504273504,0.057692307692307696,0.00641025641025641,0,0.0405982905982906,0.008547008547008548,0.08547008547008547,0,0.002136752136752137,0.002136752136752137,0,0,0.042735042735042736,0.014957264957264958,0,0,0.5042735042735043,0.004273504273504274,0.002136752136752137,0.008547008547008548,0.004273504273504274,0.05555555555555555,0.002136752136752137,0,0.00641025641025641,0.010683760683760684,0.004273504273504274,0,0.06623931623931624,0.027777777777777776,0.03418803418803419,0.014957264957264958,0,0.002136752136752137,0.03418803418803419,0.29273504273504275,0.017094017094017096,0,0.008547008547008548,0.05982905982905983,0.09188034188034189,0.06196581196581197,0.05982905982905983,0.04487179487179487,0.11965811965811966,0.11752136752136752,0.04487179487179487,0,0.004273504273504274,0.11965811965811966,0,0.017094017094017096,0.004273504273504274,0.00641025641025641,0.004273504273504274,0.010683760683760684,0,0,0.1047008547008547,0.04700854700854701,0,0.017094017094017096,0.03205128205128205,0.04700854700854701,0.16452991452991453,0.1581196581196581,0.00641025641025641,0.03418803418803419,0.019230769230769232,28.875,0,24.625,14.350000000000001,3,22.5,18.15,18,5,22.075,4,38.3,9,0,28.875,0,85.175,40.65,105.875,209.8,85.175,,0.5540854559466072,0,0.5144903455548755,0.3817717927979544,0.11433841851550566,0.49193338482966753,0.43853396683875395,0.4364916731037084,0.17706699104120877,0.48716811244411506,0.14685419906293512,0.6223806784424641,0.2791745113185196,0,0.5012031012620191,0,0.13786824214956298,0.06579799287795403,0.17137423114276465,0.3395921010035611,-0.5574754987020748,0.6604078989964389,60

139,"WASHINGTON  —   The United States’ accidental bombing of Syrian troops over the weekend has put it on the defensive, undercutting American efforts to reduce violence in the civil war and open paths for humanitarian relief. The United States had thought that if a deal to ease hostilities  in Syria, struck by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart in Geneva nine days ago, fell apart, it would reveal Russia’s duplicity in the war, in which Moscow has supported the Syrian president, Bashar  . Instead, the mistaken bombing  —   American pilots thought they were aiming at Islamic State jihadists but instead killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers, according to the Russian military  —   again exposed the White House’s struggle to put together a coherent strategy in a multisided war. The United States has conflicting aims in the war, from defeating the Islamic State to ultimately easing Mr. Assad out of office. Nearly a year after Mr. Kerry began a diplomatic process to reduce the violence, and then a political accord for a transition in power, he appears no closer to that goal than when he started. The early American calls for Mr. Assad to leave office have been muted because of fears that a power vacuum in Damascus would be exploited by jihadists. The errant bombing, for which the administration apologized to Mr. Assad, also gave both the Russians and the Syrian government a propaganda bonanza: Russia suggested it was a result of an American reluctance to share intelligence, and the Assad government said, contrary to all other evidence, that the United States was trying to protect the Islamic State. The attempt to achieve seven consecutive days of a “reduction of hostilities”  —   the first step in a series of events envisioned in the deal between the United States and Russia  —   is not dead. The clock can start anew. But American officials said it was clear that the effort could fall apart, as did a   agreement in February. American officials accused Russia of not pressing the Assad government to stop military activity and allow in humanitarian aid. Mr. Kerry, appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, called on Russia to stop “grandstanding” and to push the Assad government to honor the Geneva agreement, including allowing the delivery of aid to besieged areas. “The biggest judgment they need to make is to stop Assad from bombing people indiscriminately, which he continues to do,” Mr. Kerry said. “To allow him to continue to go after opposition, pretending that they are Nusra, is in and of itself a huge challenge to this effort. ” The new plan to reduce violence was designed to prevent Syrian forces from bombing   opposition groups while claiming the groups were embedded with Nusra forces, which until recently were officially linked to Al Qaeda. The situation in Syria on Sunday showed that the   that began last Monday was fraying. Fighter jets fired at least four missiles at opposition neighborhoods in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, while Syrian government helicopters dropped improvised barrel bombs on a village in the country’s south, killing at least nine people, a conflict monitor said. Many American officials believe that the Russians were never serious about the deal that was sealed in Geneva. The officials argue that the Russians were looking for an excuse that would derail it and keep a status quo in which they have more control over events in Syria than any other power, with the possible exception of Iran. If so, the accidental bombing made that process easier. Mr. Kerry faced many skeptics in Washington that the arrangement he worked out with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, would ever work. Chief among them was Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, the only senior member of the administration to vocally oppose the deal on the night Mr. Kerry reached it in Geneva. Mr. Carter feared that the accord would reveal too much to the Russians about American targeting intelligence, and argued that Moscow was cynically dragging out the process in President Obama’s final months in office. Mr. Kerry had argued that it was worth testing the Russians on their willingness to act. But on Sunday, whatever optimism he once had seemed gone. “The humanitarian assistance is supposed to be flowing,” Mr. Kerry said. “The regime once again is blocking it. So Russia’s client, Russia’s supported friend, is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here. ” But the deadly bombing underscored how difficult it has been to ensure that the American and Russian militaries do not become entangled on Syria’s complicated battlefield, much less to coordinate their targeting. Under the current system, terse phone calls between the Russian military and the American command post in Qatar are supposed to allow each side to notify the other about the movement of its jets  —   sometimes giving only minutes of warning. This occurred on Saturday, when an American officer in Qatar called his Russian counterpart to tell him of the impending strike, according to a Central Command official. The American strikes began, and an urgent call came 20 minutes later, in which the Russians notified the Americans in Qatar that they were slaughtering Syrian troops. “What is paradoxical here is that Centcom says it informed the Russian military it would be striking the area, which they had struck many times previously,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “You would think the Russians, as Assad’s chief international ally, would have passed on the message. ” On Saturday, Mr. Kerry also called Mr. Lavrov to reiterate the need for the Syrian military to stop its bombings and for humanitarian aid to start flowing. As of Sunday morning, the situation had not improved, a State Department official said. With world leaders and foreign ministers headed to New York for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Kerry will assemble a meeting Tuesday of the International Syria Support Group, the multinational body that has designed the plans for a reduction in violence and a political solution for Syria. That group includes the United States, Russia, China, Turkey, and European and Arab nations  —   each with different interests in the conflict. Even after the quick admission by the United States that it had accidentally killed Syrian troops and regretted the loss of life, Russian and Syrian officials seized on the bombing to argue that it was the United States, and the opposition forces it backs, that were undermining the agreement. They said that the Syrians who had been killed had been fighting Islamic State jihadists, and that the bombing was far from an accident. “The actions of coalition pilots  —   if they, as we hope, were not taken on an order from Washington  —   are on the boundary between criminal negligence and connivance with Islamic State terrorists,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We strongly urge Washington to exert the needed pressure on the illegal armed groups under its patronage to implement the   plan unconditionally,” the ministry said. “Otherwise, the implementation of the entire package of the U. S.  accords reached in Geneva on Sept. 9 may be jeopardized. ” Sunday’s airstrikes in Aleppo, which is divided between government and opposition forces, were the first to hit the city since the agreement went into effect last Monday. It was unclear whether the strikes had been launched by Syrian or Russian jets, both of which frequently bomb the opposition. It was also unclear whether the Aleppo strikes had killed anyone. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict from Britain, said four missiles had struck the city, but it did not report any deaths medics in the city posted photos online of children they said had been wounded and killed in the strikes. The Observatory also reported nine dead in the barrel bomb attacks in southern Syria, as well as scattered shelling by government forces elsewhere in the country.",,1324,24.9811320754717,53,0.37915407854984895,0,0,0,0,97.02232306575425,22.109737862003726,69.08890807078119,9.190537149879663,0.7605740181268882,0.01661631419939577,0.030211480362537766,0.021148036253776436,0.04909365558912387,0.01283987915407855,0.14123867069486404,0.015861027190332326,0.004531722054380665,0.00906344410876133,0.1095166163141994,0,0.06117824773413897,0.0030211480362537764,0.0007552870090634441,0.014350453172205438,0.0037764350453172208,0.07477341389728097,0.0007552870090634441,0.05664652567975831,0.0188821752265861,0.04380664652567976,0,0.010574018126888218,0.022658610271903322,0.013595166163141994,0.11027190332326284,0,0,0.0007552870090634441,0,0,0.006042296072507553,0.06117824773413897,0.0022658610271903325,0.0022658610271903325,0.44410876132930516,0.0022658610271903325,0.010574018126888218,0.0022658610271903325,0,0.05060422960725076,0.0022658610271903325,0,0.013595166163141994,0.013595166163141994,0.0007552870090634441,0.01812688821752266,0.0007552870090634441,0.015861027190332326,0.006042296072507553,0.030966767371601207,0.0015105740181268882,0.0007552870090634441,0.010574018126888218,0.17598187311178248,0.006797583081570997,0,0.0188821752265861,0.0513595166163142,0.05211480362537765,0.019637462235649546,0.017371601208459216,0.07326283987915408,0.1472809667673716,0.0702416918429003,0.0188821752265861,0,0.01661631419939577,0.1487915407854985,0.008308157099697885,0.0037764350453172208,0.008308157099697885,0.0015105740181268882,0.0075528700906344415,0,0,0.0075528700906344415,0.0755287009063444,0.08006042296072508,0,0.015861027190332326,0.00906344410876133,0.052870090634441085,0.10498489425981873,0.10800604229607251,0.0015105740181268882,0.02945619335347432,0.0015105740181268882,23,0,197.6,2,12,6,5,22,13.7,109.5,27,34,43,3,23,0,132.7,11,302.325,437.025,132.7,,0.41398445841918363,0,0.8585419931158781,0.057874320439771615,0.2693140767537041,0.15561117886054343,0.13312870141159136,0.4032432399798387,0.29616728494816286,0.7708138688002713,0.4533423328984415,0.5108354110960414,0.5691019375607418,0.08437005097678234,0.4508065002258462,0,0.08140979432830783,0.006748362755172466,0.18547261545068325,0.2681093848253861,-0.8804976912823519,0.7318906151746138,131

141,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Afghan officials sharply increased the tally of dead in an attack last week on a military hospital, saying Wednesday that at least 50 people, including patients and staff members, were killed. In addition, 24 people have been arrested in connection with the March 8 attack, including Afghan generals, according to Lt. Gen. Helaludin Helal, the country’s deputy minister of defense for strategic and intelligence affairs. The arrests were for a variety of charges including negligence, incompetence and complicity, General Helal said at a contentious news conference. The news conference was called after Afghan news reports and social media accounts suggested that the casualty toll was actually in the hundreds that three hospitalized Afghan generals were among those killed by the attackers and that the minister of defense, Abdullah Habibi, had personally signed the V. I. P. vehicle pass that allowed the attackers to enter the heavily guarded hospital complex in a car packed with explosives and weapons. The reports seemed to be fueled partly by contradictory government claims immediately after the attack that only two people had died, a number many officials stuck to even after personnel at the Ministry of Defense confirmed that at least 31 people were dead. In addition, it took the authorities seven hours to quell the attack, leaving the armed insurgents prowling Sardar Daud Khan Hospital for hours, hunting down patients and medical staff members in the   facility, which is usually full or nearly so. General Helal maintained that the news reports in general were distorted and incorrect, without getting into specifics. As the questioning grew heated, General Helal abruptly left, leaving the Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, to take over. General Waziri confirmed that officials were investigating the possibility that the attack was carried out by insiders, but he did not directly address assertions that doctors working at the hospital were involved. He did not identify the generals who were arrested, and did not say how many generals were arrested or what the charges were. He confirmed that the attackers brought their vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla, into the hospital compound in Kabul using an official pass, which he described as “fake. ” One of the five attackers detonated their   car with a   device as they entered the hospital grounds dressed in white medical clothing, according to the official accounts. They then carried out the attack using guns, grenades and suicide vests, at least one of which detonated. The authorities said all five attackers were killed, but Afghans have widely questioned that assertion as well, and raised questions about whether wounded Taliban prisoners who had been in the hospital might have escaped. The victims’ names have not been made public by the government, further fanning speculation about a higher death toll. Some names have emerged. One victim was Gen. Daud Askaryar, who recently retired after six years as head of the National Police Academy, according to his son, Mohammad Maroof Askaryar, who was visiting him at the time of the attack and hid in a bathroom to escape being killed. His father, he said, was stabbed to death through his oxygen tent in the intensive care unit. “The number of those killed is way higher than 50,” said Jawed Kohistani, a former general who is a military analyst with wide connections among the Afghan security forces. A retired general who is currently a member of Parliament, Nazifa Zaki, also disputed the official figure. “I believe 200 people were martyred in the hospital,” Ms. Zaki said. “This is what I heard from eyewitnesses and those who went to the hospital and funerals of the martyred. ” Much of the public ire has been directed at the country’s defense minister, General Habibi, a former   general appointed by President Ashraf Ghani, especially after reports that the general had signed the vehicle pass for the attackers. Members of Parliament have derided General Habibi, who is 64, for apparently sleeping through official meetings in the middle of a war, charges backed up by photos posted on local social media posts showing him apparently dozing off on the job. One shows him sleeping next to Mr. Ghani at an official function. “He should just go to a mosque and catch up on his sleep,” said Allah Gul Mujahid, another member of Parliament. “We need shrewd and active generals to lead the forces. This is not the place for him. ” Afghans were also critical of the country’s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, for posing for selfies with soldiers in front of the hospital immediately after the attack. The furor over the military hospital attack has underscored public disenchantment with the coalition government. It has struggled for more than a year to agree on a defense minister, and is two years overdue on holding national elections for Parliament. The military situation has steadily worsened in the meantime, with historically high casualties on the government side more and more districts that are dominated by insurgents and growing numbers of Afghans who have been displaced by fighting. The Islamic State claimed on one of its websites that it was responsible for the hospital attack, while the Taliban denied any role. Government officials, however, have blamed the Taliban, and General Helal said “we cannot deny” that one of the attackers shouted, “Long live the Taliban. ” The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has a relatively small number of fighters in Afghanistan, mostly in the eastern province of Nangarhar. And while their members have carried out attacks in Kabul  —   such as one last July at a protest that killed 80 people  —   the hospital assault was more complex and sophisticated than anything the group has done before in Afghanistan.",,946,21.5,44,0.40169133192389006,0,0,0,0,96.190772018679,20.064560332002188,70.52110519792957,1,0.8181818181818182,0.007399577167019027,0.06236786469344609,0.024312896405919663,0.05496828752642706,0.011627906976744186,0.14059196617336153,0.035940803382663845,0.0010570824524312897,0.004228329809725159,0.10359408033826638,0.0010570824524312897,0.06659619450317125,0.026427061310782242,0.006342494714587738,0.008456659619450317,0.004228329809725159,0.056025369978858354,0,0.06765327695560254,0.03382663847780127,0.045454545454545456,0,0.016913319238900635,0.017970401691331923,0.0021141649048625794,0.11205073995771671,0,0.0021141649048625794,0.0010570824524312897,0.0010570824524312897,0,0.0021141649048625794,0.06659619450317125,0,0,0.4503171247357294,0.0200845665961945,0.012684989429175475,0.0021141649048625794,0.003171247357293869,0.045454545454545456,0.003171247357293869,0,0.011627906976744186,0.016913319238900635,0.004228329809725159,0.017970401691331923,0.003171247357293869,0.024312896405919663,0.007399577167019027,0.048625792811839326,0.0010570824524312897,0.0010570824524312897,0.024312896405919663,0.2346723044397463,0.003171247357293869,0,0.021141649048625793,0.048625792811839326,0.06553911205073996,0.02536997885835095,0.006342494714587738,0.08350951374207188,0.15010570824524314,0.0708245243128964,0.017970401691331923,0,0.016913319238900635,0.14376321353065538,0.012684989429175475,0.003171247357293869,0.011627906976744186,0,0.007399577167019027,0,0,0.014799154334038054,0.080338266384778,0.08456659619450317,0,0.017970401691331923,0.005285412262156448,0.03488372093023256,0.10993657505285412,0.12367864693446089,0.0021141649048625794,0.02854122621564482,0,16.75,0,248.25,3.5,0,0,3,27.25,4,92.75,12,1,10,3,16.75,0,43.75,3,335.25,370,43.75,,0.3608763192750027,0,0.8932593924672741,0.10553359702603202,0,0,0.0918419998222135,0.4787858851727313,0.11881849050177154,0.7576698616926064,0.2880129448105867,0.03261068708575956,0.2521127429279827,0.0918419998222135,0.6663682990076563,0,0.03536782538399353,0.002425222312045271,0.271018593371059,0.2991107518189167,-0.9328711162327753,0.7008892481810833,79
142,"SPRINGFIELD, N. J.  —   For Jimmy Walker, Sunday was his fourth successive day atop the leaderboard at the P. G. A. Championship. He had played throughout with an unruffled calm, a countenance that belied his inner unease about the outcome of the tournament. Walker was a tenderfoot when it came to the crucible of the last hours of a major championship. He had missed the cut in his last two majors, never finished higher than tied for seventh at any major and was perhaps best known on the PGA Tour for his unusual hobby: astrophotography. Now, in Sunday’s final round, he was being chased by   golf heavyweights, like Jason Day, the world’s   player and the defending P. G. A. champ. Undaunted, Walker had kept his competitors at arm’s length with a   round at the venerable Baltusrol Golf Club, and as he walked to the final tee, he held a   lead. Then Day, in second place, eagled the   18th hole, and Walker suddenly had to par his final hole or face a playoff. Or worse, second place. Walker understood the situation completely. “Brutal,” he said. But Walker drove his tee shot in the fairway and then made the gutsy decision to go for the green. His second shot was slightly wayward, but after a delicate pitch and a nervy   Walker had proved his championship poise. With a steely round of 67, which left him 14 under par for the tournament, Walker became the fourth   major champion of the 2016 golf season. Walker said Day’s     dramatics had not surprised him. “I was hoping to relax  —   I could have used it  —   but I wouldn’t have expected any less from Jason,” he said. Of his choice to hit a fairway wood on the final hole instead of laying up short of the 18th green, Walker said he was only playing the percentages. “I bet 19 out of 20 times, you make five by going for that green,” Walker said. But with a major championship on the line? Walker shrugged and smiled. His second shot sent his ball into deep rough next to a bunker that he would have to cross with his next shot to hold the green. “Not a great lie played that a little safe,” he said of the pitch he flew high over the bunker and 35 feet beyond the hole. Walker’s first putt scooted three feet past the hole, setting up yet another nervy moment. “A little tester,” he said of the second putt. “Just buried it. Just awesome. ” Walker became the first    winner of the P. G. A. Championship since Phil Mickelson, who won at Baltusrol in 2005. Joining Walker as   major winners this year were the Masters champion Danny Willett Dustin Johnson, who won the United States Open and Henrik Stenson, the British Open champ. Daniel Summerhays finished third Sunday at 10 under. Three golfers were tied for fourth at nine under: Branden Grace, Hideki Matsuyama and Brooks Koepka. “I was trying to make a run at Jimmy all day,” said Day, who finished at 13 under after also shooting a   67. “I just couldn’t do it until the very end. ” Walker, 37, has not had an easy path to the highest echelon of golf. Though he first played on the PGA Tour in 2005, he was frequently sent back to the equivalent of the minor leagues and had to requalify for the tour three times. It was not until 2011 that he began to establish himself. Still, Walker, who played at Baylor, competed in 187 tour events before claiming his first victory at the end of 2013. He went on to win two of the next seven events. This year on the Tour has not been his best, with his highest finish a tie for fourth. Walker, who was at 11 under after the first three rounds, began his final round with nine consecutive pars. Each hole seemed to have a sameness to it. Walker was usually in the fairway, and his approaches left him manageable distances for birdie opportunities. If he did not capitalize on them, he also did not make any grievous mistakes. But the missed birdie putts might have been starting to grate on him. When he found himself in a greenside bunker at the 10th hole, Walker fidgeted over the shot for close to 20 seconds. Then he found a way to make a birdie without putting by holing a flipped sand wedge. That moved him to 12 under. With a new bounce in his step, Walker went to the next green and rolled in a   downhill birdie putt to extend his lead over Day to two strokes. Moments earlier, Day, whose driver was so erratic he had switched to a   off the tee, drained a   putt on No. 11 to close to a stroke back from Walker. But for the next several holes, Day’s approach shots to greens were increasingly wayward and left him with exceedingly long birdie putts that he could not convert. He did not seriously challenge Walker again until No. 18, where he rolled in a   putt for his eagle. A few minutes earlier, Walker had taken a   lead over Day, sinking an   birdie putt on No. 17. It proved to be a pivotal stroke gained. The golf on Sunday began at 7 a. m. under unfamiliar circumstances because tournament officials had made the unusual decision to continue the   third round on Sunday morning and begin the fourth at almost the same time. For several hours, it made for a confusing leaderboard, with many in the field playing their final round without knowing how the third round would end up. The wet conditions led P. G. A. officials to decide to play the tournament’s final 18 holes under the   rule, also known as “lift, clean and place. ” It was feared by some players that the rule would lead to unusually low scores, perhaps even a score of 62, which would have been a record for a major championship. But the scoring, while low, was not uncustomary for the event. The golfer with the field’s lowest total score did not think the rule had much effect on his play. He was more focused on what his victory signified. “For me, I feel like it was a matter of time,” Walker said. “It was a long time coming, and this was a long day. But I’ll take it. It all ended well. ”",,1081,13.182926829268293,82,0.24514338575393155,0,0,0,0,94.59731583043332,36.12445741122892,58.7698712018786,67.71725915157921,0.8242368177613321,0.03330249768732655,0.0545790934320074,0.03145235892691952,0.04995374653098982,0.0027752081406105457,0.1683626271970398,0.0009250693802035153,0.0027752081406105457,0.010175763182238668,0.10638297872340426,0.0009250693802035153,0.05735430157261795,0.0064754856614246065,0.0037002775208140612,0.016651248843663275,0.0064754856614246065,0.0851063829787234,0.0018501387604070306,0.058279370952821465,0.02127659574468085,0.043478260869565216,0,0.0018501387604070306,0.02497687326549491,0.012950971322849213,0.07585568917668825,0,0,0.012950971322849213,0,0,0.008325624421831638,0.08880666049953746,0,0,0.4838112858464385,0.0027752081406105457,0.008325624421831638,0,0.008325624421831638,0.03145235892691952,0.0018501387604070306,0,0.016651248843663275,0.012025901942645698,0.024051803885291396,0.05180388529139685,0.0009250693802035153,0.024051803885291396,0.01757631822386679,0.013876040703052728,0,0.0009250693802035153,0.05272895467160037,0.2645698427382054,0.0027752081406105457,0,0.025901942645698426,0.07400555041628122,0.04717853839037928,0.06290471785383904,0.036077705827937095,0.05087881591119334,0.15356151711378355,0.09435707678075855,0.01572617946345976,0.0009250693802035153,0.020351526364477335,0.20351526364477335,0,0.01942645698427382,0.0027752081406105457,0.005550416281221091,0.011100832562442183,0,0,0.05180388529139685,0.07215541165587419,0.09620721554116558,0,0.01572617946345976,0.0018501387604070306,0.0851063829787234,0.12303422756706753,0.13043478260869565,0,0.020351526364477335,0.0009250693802035153,65,0,18,0,25.65,17,0,18.65,35.83,24,0.65,43,11,0,65,6,147.48000000000002,29,77.15,243.13000000000002,147.48000000000002,,0.6161317697983921,0,0.3077085428019735,0,0.38777319541129995,0.29566804505163874,0,0.3153165382295456,0.4694281266533991,0.3721108299842069,0.015797053662124277,0.514989096204658,0.21360503494994398,0,0.3483680651818277,0.12904082342630863,0.1181607685096905,0.023234759199762842,0.06181247145730012,0.19479541393925312,0.7106506711699524,0.8052045860607469,76
143,"College Republicans at UC Davis have challenged a statement from UC Davis administrators claiming that the group cancelled MILO’s event voluntarily. College Republican representatives are claiming that the administration intimidated them, lied to them, and largely took the decision to cancel without them. [Speaking to Breitbart News, UC Davis College Republicans executive director, Andrew Mendoza stated that the campus group was “absolutely” intimidated by campus faculty into cancelling the event. UC Davis administrators reportedly told the College Republicans that they would be “personally liable for property damage and injury to people and even death. ”  “They basically took the decision without us and consequently forced us to take responsibility for it. ” said Andrew Mendoza speaking exclusively to Breitbart News, “We were heavily pressured by the university police to cancel the event, as we were told people’s lives could be endangered if it went ahead. ”  All responsibility was placed on the young students, “We were told that if our insurance failed it would be on us. ” said Mendoza. Of course this is not legally accurate, colleges are required to keep speaker and students safe at their expense. The responsibility for the safety of students and MILO is on the college, not the event organisers.  UC Davis is still attempting to claim that there was never a risk of violence at the event and that protesters acted peacefully, despite video evidence that directly proves otherwise. “The police have been excellent, the students are being completely peaceful and respectful, and they are standing up for the rights of the community,” said a UC Davis college counsellor as protesters outside reportedly smashed windows and threw barricades at police. “UCD is denying that there were hammers there. ” said Kurtie Kellner, a communications director for the Davis College Republicans, “We were told by Milton Lang (Associate to the Vice Chancellor for Student Life, Campus Community and Retention Service) that there were in fact hammers at the event. ”  “Our concern was about hammers and the protesters using them on the glass to get into building when the Chief of Police suggested that they had more concerning weapons. This was the safety concern that led to our cancellation of the event. If there hasn’t been hammers, we wouldn’t have feared for  ’s safety, and we wouldn’t have felt pressured to cancel the event. ”  When asked for comment, UC Davis Associate Director Andy Fell said, “To reiterate the statement we issued last night, the DCR cancelled last night’s event on the advice of UC Davis police and officials because it was no longer possible to continue the event safely. ” Watch MILO’s full march through UC Davis to protest the cancellation of the event here.",,451,23.736842105263158,19,0.35476718403547675,0,0,0,0,85.38567253145968,8.178596175166298,80.01589061345159,19.174180832717415,0.802660753880266,0.008869179600886918,0.019955654101995565,0.03547671840354767,0.04878048780487805,0.04434589800443459,0.15521064301552107,0.011086474501108648,0.008869179600886918,0.017738359201773836,0.08425720620842572,0.0022172949002217295,0.082039911308204,0.0066518847006651885,0.0022172949002217295,0.011086474501108648,0.017738359201773836,0.07982261640798226,0,0.04656319290465632,0.008869179600886918,0.050997782705099776,0,0.0022172949002217295,0.024390243902439025,0.017738359201773836,0.1352549889135255,0,0,0.0022172949002217295,0,0,0.0022172949002217295,0.07538802660753881,0,0,0.4678492239467849,0.0066518847006651885,0.017738359201773836,0.0022172949002217295,0,0.03991130820399113,0.0022172949002217295,0,0.015521064301552107,0.004434589800443459,0.0022172949002217295,0,0.004434589800443459,0.008869179600886918,0.019955654101995565,0.026607538802660754,0,0,0,0.16851441241685144,0.0022172949002217295,0.0022172949002217295,0.024390243902439025,0.04212860310421286,0.11086474501108648,0.04878048780487805,0.022172949002217297,0.05321507760532151,0.13082039911308205,0.08869179600886919,0.008869179600886918,0,0.04434589800443459,0.10421286031042129,0,0.008869179600886918,0.024390243902439025,0.0022172949002217295,0.004434589800443459,0,0,0,0.09977827050997783,0.04434589800443459,0,0.008869179600886918,0.019955654101995565,0.050997782705099776,0.12638580931263857,0.13747228381374724,0.028824833702882482,0.09977827050997783,0,13,0,70.5,7,36.25,0,12,2,1,42.5,9,0,6,6,13,0,52.25,14,114,167.25,52.25,,0.4000789240048961,0,0.7833891394546999,0.2642148665478112,0.6502990003360055,0,0.38102993337040314,0.09305100366818048,0.04879574852141934,0.685554762973699,0.3158605291189343,0,0.23535329109798714,0.23535329109798714,0.5980171973993061,0,0.09130624726955003,0.024464831804281346,0.19921363040629095,0.29226736566186107,-0.8175121156641456,0.7077326343381389,46
144,"Fast food 'combo meals' tied to kids' over-consumption of high-calorie drinks Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: fast food , obesity , children (NaturalNews) Fast food chains know how to squeeze every last dollar out of their customers. From decorating their establishments with appetite-stimulating colors, to pricing their meals to encourage people to get bigger sizes, their every move is perfectly calculated to maximize profits. Unfortunately, these practices are hurting a lot more than just your wallet – they are also affecting the health of your children.A study led by researchers from the NYU Langone Medical Center found that children who ate at any of five fast food chains consumed an average of 179 more calories when their meals came with soda, juice, sweetened tea or flavored milk, when compared to those who drank unsweetened beverages with their meals.The researchers also discovered that the children consumed an average of 82 more drink calories when the drinks were part of bundled meals than when the drinks were bought separately. Moreover, parents who bought a combo meal were 24 percent more likely to buy a high-calorie drink sweetened with sugar.The study looked at almost 500 children aged 18 and younger who ate food from McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Subway or Wendy's in New York and New Jersey between January 2013 and June 2014. Seventy-four percent of the combo meals purchased were kids' meals. Half of the drinks were sodas , and 38 percent of them were juice, with flavored milk making up 5 percent. A further 5 percent was made up of lemonade, sweetened tea and hot chocolate. Non-sugary drinks proved to be quite unpopular, with regular milk accounting for just 2 percent and water a measly 1 percent.Dr. Brian Elbel of NYU Langone, the study's senior investigator, said: ""Our study strongly suggests that uncoupling sugary drinks from combo meal deals might reduce high-calorie beverage consumption and help to curb childhood obesity rates fueled by these kinds of liquid calories."" Parents need to take responsibility Combo meals tend to appeal to big families, which can find their bills quickly adding up at fast food restaurants. Well-meaning parents who might not normally allow their children to drink sugary beverages sometimes find themselves giving in when the drink is included.Although the practice on the part of fast food chains of bundling unhealthy foods together to create perceived value encourage unhealthy habits, it is ultimately up to the parents to decide which meals to buy for their children. Parents have the final say, and just because that super-sized Coke comes with your child's meal does not mean that you should let them drink it. Fast track to diabetes Fast food meals are already high in calories, which means that the last thing you should be doing is pairing them with high-calorie beverages. Research published in the journal Diabetes Care showed that drinking even just one sugary beverage each day raised a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 25 percent. It also upped the risk of developing metabolic syndrome by 20 percent.With around 17 percent of our nation's youth believed to be obese, there is an urgent need for poor eating habits to be curbed. Until people start giving up the convenience of the local drive-through and start making a concerted effort to feed their children clean food , the situation is only likely to get worse, and more and more children will end up obese or diabetic.So, the next time you're thinking of ordering that combo meal, keep in mind that any money that you might save on a meal deal is likely to end up costing far more in medical bills down the road.

146,"LOS ANGELES  —   Nine days after Nikolas Michaud’s latest heroin relapse, the skinny    sat on a roof deck at a new drug rehabilitation clinic here. He picked up a bong, filled it with a pinch of marijuana, lit the leaves and inhaled. All this took place in plain view of the clinic’s director. “The rules here are a little lax,” Mr. Michaud said. In almost any other rehab setting in the country, smoking pot would be a major infraction and a likely cause for being booted out. But here at High Sobriety  —   the clinic with a name that sounds like the title of a Cheech and Chong comeback movie  —   it is not just permitted, but part of the treatment. The new clinic is experimenting with a concept made possible by the growing legalization of marijuana: that pot, rather than being a gateway into drugs, could be a gateway out. A small but growing number of pain doctors and addiction specialists are overseeing the use of marijuana as a substitute for more potent and dangerous drugs. Dr. Mark Wallace, chairman of the division of pain medicine in the department of anesthesia at the University of California, San Diego, said over the last five years he has used marijuana to help several hundred patients transition off opiates. “The majority of patients continue to use it,” he said of marijuana. But he added that they tell him of the opiates: “I feel like I was a slave to that drug. I feel like I have my life back. ” Dr. Wallace is quick to note that his evidence is anecdotal and more study is needed. Research in rats, he said, supports the idea that the use of cannabinoids can induce withdrawal from heavier substances. But in humans? A report published in  January from the National Academy of Sciences on the health effects of cannabis “found no evidence to support or refute the conclusion that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for achieving abstinence in the use of addictive substances,” said Dr. Marie McCormick, a Harvard professor who was the chairwoman of the report committee. The group’s research did find strong evidence to support that cannabis or related compounds can be used to treat chronic pain in adults. But that is different from using it safely and effectively to wean people off drugs, and some experts in the addiction field are highly skeptical. “The concept on its face is absurd,” said Dr. Mark Willenbring, a psychiatrist who treats addicts and formerly oversaw research at the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. He said that alternative approaches are needed to traditional drug treatment, but not this. “I’m not prone to making exaggerated or unqualified statements and in this case I don’t need to make any: It doesn’t work,” he said. “Like trying to cure alcoholism with Valium. ” The idea stems not only from the legalization of marijuana in several states, including California, but also from a broader reckoning taking place in the traditional addiction treatment business:   treatment often fails, costing families, the government or insurers tens of thousands of dollars per therapy. Many patients quit partway through treatment, or relapse time and again. These failings have become more apparent owing to a handful of developments: a growing death toll from opiates and an increase in the death rate of young white adults caused by drug overdoses. There also is a growing conversation about whether some update is needed to the bedrock   program: It demands total abstinence but many people fail and ultimately die. Some research suggests that marijuana might help stem the tide. A study published in 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine found that states with medical marijuana laws have lower rates of death from opiate overdose. Another paper, published this year in The International Journal of Drug Policy, found that 30 percent of the 271 respondents reported that they used marijuana as a substitute for opiates. (But the researchers noted that the sample could be unrepresentative and that it was not known if marijuana provided a partial or total substitute for other drugs, and how much other drug use was displaced.) More concrete and direct evidence has been hard to gather given that marijuana is still seen as a   Schedule 1 drug by the federal government, which severely limits availability of funding for studies on humans. Amanda Reiman, a   expert and lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, called the lack of such studies “a huge barrier. ” She said that the dearth of evidence argues not just for further study, but for pushing ahead with clinics like High Sobriety. Her main point is that opiates and other addictive drugs kill people so why not make every effort to find a better way. “There’s no scientific reason to believe that somebody is better off being completely miserable and sober than using cannabis occasionally, or even fairly regularly, as an adult and being functional and happy and productive,” said Dr. Reiman, an unpaid consultant with High Sobriety, who added, “Using cannabis is a relatively safe practice. ” The   and main investor in High Sobriety, Michael Welch, is a recovering heroin addict who was helped by a traditional,   program. He also   and operates several    rehabilitation clinics that have a total of 100 beds. (Charges range from $25, 000 to $80, 000 a month for a private room). “Every single treatment center knows it, and we know it,’’ Mr. Welch said. “Some of us have had the same clients, five, 10, 15 times over. We say: ‘We just can’t reach Billy, we just can’t reach Joe. ’” Why not, he said, try marijuana to help take the edge off for clients who “can’t face the emotional threshold” of abstinence. “People are dying,” he said. His   Joe Schrank, argued that marijuana will not kill patients as opiates do. But it does help clients sleep, relax and develop an appetite. The drug, he said, gives addicts some sense of emotional control. High Sobriety’s first inpatient was Mr. Michaud, who shared his story in February and it seems tailor made to test their hypothesis. A military brat who moved around, he said he felt traumatized when his homosexuality surfaced as a child and he was told in places like Kansas and South Carolina that he wasn’t gay but suffering from various mental disorders.   led to   until his life, he said, was a cocktail party of morphine, heroin and pills. His mother, Kristen Michaud, said that over the years she sent him to half a dozen programs, several of them more than once, and spent more than $300, 000. But so far he has stayed the course at High Sobriety, which Mr. Schrank attributed to the availability of marijuana. “If this kid doesn’t get cannabis, he’s a goner,” said Mr. Schrank, himself a recovering addict who previously founded and ran a clinic in Brooklyn. “If it wasn’t for cannabis, he’d have bolted in the middle of the night. ”",,1168,21.62962962962963,54,0.3142123287671233,0,0,0,0,89.8958548301014,14.131797426317975,62.75342465753425,18.220288781932616,0.853595890410959,0.015410958904109588,0.04965753424657534,0.028253424657534245,0.028253424657534245,0.015410958904109588,0.17294520547945205,0.004280821917808219,0.0008561643835616438,0.016267123287671232,0.08647260273972603,0,0.05736301369863014,0.0547945205479452,0.003424657534246575,0.028253424657534245,0.00684931506849315,0.12243150684931507,0.0059931506849315065,0.0625,0.029965753424657533,0.06164383561643835,0,0.0059931506849315065,0.04280821917808219,0.010273972602739725,0.0779109589041096,0,0.0017123287671232876,0.007705479452054794,0.003424657534246575,0,0.0025684931506849314,0.05650684931506849,0,0,0.4563356164383562,0.04708904109589041,0.017123287671232876,0.004280821917808219,0.0059931506849315065,0.05051369863013699,0,0.0059931506849315065,0.026541095890410957,0.012842465753424657,0.019691780821917807,0.028253424657534245,0.0059931506849315065,0.01113013698630137,0.016267123287671232,0.016267123287671232,0,0,0.019691780821917807,0.23886986301369864,0.005136986301369863,0.0017123287671232876,0.029965753424657533,0.053082191780821915,0.08476027397260275,0.04023972602739726,0.01113013698630137,0.04366438356164384,0.136986301369863,0.09075342465753425,0.030821917808219176,0.0008561643835616438,0.0273972602739726,0.10702054794520548,0,0.008561643835616438,0.0059931506849315065,0.005136986301369863,0.003424657534246575,0,0.0017123287671232876,0.026541095890410957,0.09332191780821918,0.06763698630136987,0,0.025684931506849314,0.003424657534246575,0.029965753424657533,0.125,0.1284246575342466,0.004280821917808219,0.05136986301369863,0,26.45,0,64.45,5.125,12.35,1,0,29.7,13.625,61.625,19.35,17,5.75,30,26.45,0,84.17500000000001,9.625,209.775,291.19999999999993,84.17500000000001,,0.44593668139432735,0,0.6622934850653296,0.13490976929820533,0.2731493918842539,0.02953044805404075,0,0.47471879881868534,0.2930841595532817,0.6521967813991771,0.3705948521083763,0.3409317429270157,0.14891221523661374,0.47722557505166113,0.7459608724279617,0,0.060899290985385636,0.006963536391260311,0.15176891911445525,0.21067862827376643,-0.8438710834727956,0.7893213717262335,77
147,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. New polls showed a   bounce for Hillary Clinton. With just 37 more days before Election Day, she campaigned in Coral Springs, Fla. above. Democrats have benefited from a Supreme Court ruling two years ago that loosened rules on campaign donations, but large numbers of immigrants who have applied for citizenship are caught in a backlog and will not be registered in time to vote. Mrs. Clinton’s team is also preparing for the likelihood that Mr. Trump will begin  his   focus on Bill Clinton’s infidelities. _____ 2. An apparently sleepless Donald Trump produced an overnight tweetstorm, including recommending a seemingly nonexistent sex tape of the beauty queen he criticized for gaining weight. That, along with a blithe comment he made in this week’s debate about a hypothetical   hacker, set off a wave of concern over  . Above, Mr. Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich. _____ 3. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, shook hands with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, a fitting moment of détente at the funeral of Shimon Peres. The last of the generation of leaders who helped found Israel, Peres won the admiration of leaders around the world for his tireless promotion of a   solution. _____ 4. Fears of a new global financial shock are rising over a crisis at Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank, whose vast operations reach into investment houses across the world. How Germany’s government responds will test new rules in the European Union concerning banks “too big to fail. ” _____ 5.  In spite of the devastation around them, Syrian children played after an airstrike broke a water pipe in the city of Aleppo. Of the hundreds of people killed over days of aerial bombardment, more than 100 were children, a World Health Organization official said. Hundreds more have been wounded, both children and adults, and many are expected to die for lack of treatment. Behind closed doors last week, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed frustration over U. S. policy to Syrian civilians meeting with him in New York. “I lost the argument” for force,” he told them. _____ 6. Defying the U. S. Supreme Court has consequences. For Alabama’s chief justice, Roy Moore, the penalty for urging state officials to refuse to grant marriage licenses to   couples was suspension for the remainder of his term. But those who recall his prior removal  —   over his insistence on keeping a giant monument of the Ten Commandments at the state judicial building  —   don’t expect him to disappear. “The last time he was kicked off as chief justice, he ran for governor,” a former court spokesman said. “I don’t think he’s done. ” _____ 7. One of our   articles today takes on a task faced by many American cities: healing the scars of the urban renewal era. A signal casualty was New York’s soaring,   style Penn Station, above, razed 50 years ago and replaced with what our architecture critic calls “a shameful rat’s maze. ” Now, a top architect, at the behest of editors of The Times’s   page, has come up with a new hub that repurposes Madison Square Garden, below, turning its stripped skeleton into a convivial glass pavilion to remake a grim concrete and asphalt expanse. _____ 8. For the weekend: Our movie critic commends “Deepwater Horizon,” calling it “a swift and suspenseful action movie, full of noise, peril, muck and fire. ” HBO debuts “Westworld” on Sunday, depicting what our reviewer describes as “a dark Disneyland where the wealthy can wallow in incredibly lifelike Old West fantasy. ” Here’s what else is in theaters, and here are more   recommendations. And for the literary, consider our book critics’ nine selections, including “Born to Run,” by   …     oh, you know.  _____ 9. And if you have any spare time, we can help you navigate the sudden flood of lavish credit card offers. For instance, a   card beats a rewards card if you ring up under $8, 600 in card purchases. But if you travel abroad, savings on foreign transaction fees can tip the balance. _____ 10. Finally, there was a moment both sad and triumphant in the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. Rosetta, the first spacecraft to orbit a comet, flatlined at 7:19 a. m. Eastern Standard Time with a soft   onto the comet’s surface. The project scientist said team members mourned the craft’s demise but that “they’re still happy that we got to this stage”  —   faced with reams of data to parse.

148,"Rep. Dave Brat ( ) talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding the Freedom Caucus endorsement of the GOP’s Obamacare repeal plan, his evaluation of  President Donald Trump’s first 100 days, and the budget deal. [While discussing the details of the Republican House and White House debate about the Obamacare repeal, Brat said, “In the conference, we’ve moved the thing as far as we can move it in the free market direction without losing the votes. ”  Asked if the latest tax bill is “for show or the real thing,” Brat said, “Well, it’s both. It’s    trillion in tax deductions and possible increases in the deficit  —   in that neighborhood. That’s a whopper. So they’ve got to find that repatriation. There’s two trillion dollars overseas they can bring back to lessen the pain on the deficit side. So they’ve got to do some of that movement, too. We can’t sustain deficits that big. ” Brat also said he gives Trump “an A” for his first 100 days. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

149,"For someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an “organizational genius,” as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it, it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. “Chaos” seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by “turmoil. ” (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred “ . ”) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation’s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy “so poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad. ” Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout. ” All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a   machine. So it doesn’t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trump’s first weeks, purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness, as I did this week. The unanimous verdict: Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch. “This is so basic, it’s covered in the introduction to the M. B. A. program that all our students take,” said Lindred Greer, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. By all outward indications, Mr. Trump “desperately needs to take the course,” she said. Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t,” said Mr. Trump’s executive actions as president “are so far from any responsible management approach” that they all but defy analysis. “Of course, this isn’t new,” he told me. “His campaign also violated every prudent management principle. Everyone including our friends on Wall Street somehow believed that once he was president he’d change. I don’t understand that logic. ” Wall Street did take notice. After months of cheering the prospect of tax reform and infrastructure spending, investors sold stocks after a weekend of chaos at the nation’s airports connected to the president’s executive order on immigration. On Monday, the Dow industrials experienced the biggest   decline since the election, fueled by worries that a dysfunctional White House wouldn’t be able to execute Mr. Trump’s policies. “If you thought immigration was bad, just wait for health care,” Mr. Pfeffer warned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. There is an enormous amount of literature and data exploring what constitutes effective management of complicated organizations. “The core principles have served many leaders really well,” said Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School. “It’s really common sense: You want to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand. Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a   solution. ” This is often easier said than done. It “requires an openness to being challenged, and some   and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do,” Mr. Polzer continued. “This doesn’t mean decisions are made by consensus. The person at the top makes the decisions, but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision. ” Mr. Trump has already violated several of these core principles. The secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, was still discussing a proposed executive order restricting immigration when Mr. Trump went ahead and signed it. Nor was Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, consulted he saw the final order only hours before it went into effect. Not to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order “is insane,” since they “have the expertise and should be on top of the data,” Ms. Greer said. “Ignoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing. ” And there’s another reason to consult, Mr. Polzer said: “When people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected, they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities, even if the decision doesn’t go their way. ” Conversely, people who aren’t consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome. Far from encouraging and weighing differing views as part of the   process, Mr. Trump appears to view dissension as disloyalty. After career State Department officers circulated a draft cable questioning the effectiveness of the immigration ban, Mr. Spicer responded, “They should either get with the program or they can go. ” “Debate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome,” Ms. Greer said. Comments like Mr. Spicer’s “will discourage anyone from speaking up. You end up with group think, an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear. ” And while it’s understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises  —   he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on “Day 1”  —   his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through. Some had to be reframed (talk of a Mexican border surcharge) or significantly modified and clarified after the fact (immigration policy). I asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of Mr. Trump’s policies, but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked. “When you’re on the receiving end of a policy decision, the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand,” Mr. Polzer said. “If either one is done poorly, the outcomes will be bad. Even good plans that are poorly rolled out aren’t going to work well. ” For many people, the Affordable Care Act was indelibly tainted by the computer malfunctions that plagued its start. Similarly, for many Americans, the enduring image of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy will be that of a tearful Iraqi immigrant who was detained at Kennedy International Airport after risking his life working as a translator for the American military over a   period. (He was released after lawyers intervened on his behalf.) That prompted even Mr. Ryan to say, “No one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this. ” Some Trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos, and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past. But every expert I consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool. “I’m not aware of anyone who advocates that,” Mr. Polzer said. “I don’t really know what’s going on in the White House, so I don’t feel comfortable commenting on that specifically. But I can say in general that in organizational settings, less chaos is a good thing. ” Everyone agreed that there was still time for Mr. Trump to right the ship. Other administrations have had course corrections and personnel  . But having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising. If this were the private sector, “someone would be fired,” Ms. Greer said. That seems highly unlikely, since Mr. Trump has not even acknowledged a problem, instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the White House. That is a fundamental problem, Mr. Pfeffer said. “No good business makes decisions that are based on falsehoods,” he said. “My sense is that Trump takes no one’s counsel but his own. That’s bad management, period. ”",,1373,19.069444444444443,72,0.3313911143481428,0,0,0,0,87.12780636133343,27.472986970947645,71.74607914542365,29.422407514378282,0.8397669337217771,0.018936635105608158,0.051711580480699196,0.03277494537509104,0.045884923525127456,0.005098324836125273,0.20684632192279678,0.004369992716678805,0.003641660597232338,0.022578295702840496,0.0808448652585579,0,0.07283321194464676,0.004369992716678805,0.0021849963583394027,0.021849963583394028,0.016023306627822288,0.12964311726147124,0.003641660597232338,0.05680990531682447,0.032046613255644577,0.053896576839038604,0,0.0029133284777858705,0.03058994901675164,0.012381646030589949,0.11580480699198835,0,0,0.003641660597232338,0.0029133284777858705,0,0.00873998543335761,0.04224326292789512,0.0007283321194464676,0.0007283321194464676,0.4442825928623452,0.0014566642388929353,0.018936635105608158,0.005826656955571741,0.007283321194464676,0.051711580480699196,0.0021849963583394027,0.0007283321194464676,0.04005826656955572,0.013109978150036417,0.0014566642388929353,0.028404952658412235,0.012381646030589949,0.02112163146394756,0.016751638747268753,0.021849963583394028,0.0007283321194464676,0.0014566642388929353,0.007283321194464676,0.23306627822286963,0.0014566642388929353,0.0029133284777858705,0.035688273852876914,0.07137654770575383,0.09249817916970138,0.035688273852876914,0.02403495994173343,0.0808448652585579,0.13182811361981064,0.08739985433357611,0.024763292061179897,0,0.04806991988346686,0.12163146394756008,0,0.011653313911143482,0.008011653313911144,0.0014566642388929353,0.010924981791697014,0,0,0.013109978150036417,0.1056081573197378,0.05899490167516387,0,0.027676620538965767,0.00873998543335761,0.037144938091769844,0.13546977421704298,0.1412964311726147,0.0014566642388929353,0.07574654042243263,0.005098324836125273,49.75,0,78,4,16,18.25,22,45,9.3,74.5,14.75,28,40.25,0,49.75,0,145.05,42.25,202.25,374.5,145.05,,0.5672920590587308,0,0.6727192312838925,0.09535767393825997,0.29658556651379125,0.3247485134227317,0.36698880992097505,0.5425129290753421,0.1968365116436459,0.6625323938469604,0.27990031870733934,0.42458124057404795,0.5147234440190088,0,0.3874258867227931,0,0.08863428047662696,0.02581729300336083,0.12358692331194622,0.2288420409410327,-0.6806864616293122,0.7711579590589673,111
150,"on October 27, 2016 2:53 am · Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they’re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. Trump supporters are taking Trump’s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them — all of which are illegal. But, Trump’s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as “Vote Protectors.” The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. According to the Huffington Post , Stone’s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake “exit polls,” efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that’s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group’s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a “bad idea” and “ordered them taken down.” Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. “It’s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,” she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. “When that’s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.” Indeed, but that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. As it turns out, he’s right about the election being rigged, only it’s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. “I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,” Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. “UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn’t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.” So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump’s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.
