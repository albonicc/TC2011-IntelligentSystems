1,"House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) With apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week–FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. As we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 Of course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. But according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” So let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. There has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. What it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. Granted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

2,"Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.’ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton’s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November’s election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn’t president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.",0,706,20.764705882352942,34,0.311614730878187,0,0,0,0,91.5315661675435,13.737652420248802,89.35379860932268,25.774193548387096,0.8356940509915014,0.018413597733711047,0.053824362606232294,0.049575070821529746,0.059490084985835696,0.0169971671388102,0.16572237960339944,0.0169971671388102,0.00141643059490085,0.007082152974504249,0.09490084985835694,0,0.03541076487252125,0.0056657223796034,0.0028328611898017,0.014164305949008499,0.018413597733711047,0.10623229461756374,0,0.049575070821529746,0.029745042492917848,0.05099150141643059,0,0,0.021246458923512748,0.012747875354107648,0.08781869688385269,0,0.0056657223796034,0.00424929178470255,0.05099150141643059,0,0.009915014164305949,0.042492917847025496,0.00141643059490085,0.00141643059490085,0.49291784702549574,0.00141643059490085,0.012747875354107648,0.00141643059490085,0.009915014164305949,0.043909348441926344,0.0028328611898017,0.00141643059490085,0.029745042492917848,0.0226628895184136,0.0028328611898017,0.00424929178470255,0.0028328611898017,0.009915014164305949,0.009915014164305949,0.029745042492917848,0.00141643059490085,0.00141643059490085,0.021246458923512748,0.20679886685552407,0.0084985835694051,0.0028328611898017,0.026912181303116147,0.042492917847025496,0.046742209631728045,0.08356940509915015,0.029745042492917848,0.036827195467422094,0.16147308781869688,0.1274787535410765,0.012747875354107648,0.0056657223796034,0.049575070821529746,0.14022662889518414,0,0.009915014164305949,0.0169971671388102,0.007082152974504249,0.007082152974504249,0,0,0.043909348441926344,0.14589235127478753,0.07932011331444759,0,0.019830028328611898,0.009915014164305949,0.053824362606232294,0.11898016997167139,0.09631728045325778,0.0084985835694051,0.039660056657223795,0.0113314447592068,25,0,72,3,4,15,4,14,25,30,16.5,18.125,48,0,25,0,108.125,25,114,243.125,108.125,,0.4894589185502704,0,0.7341184962925482,0.10317500575623216,0.13299282904102766,0.36516954793881085,0.13299282904102766,0.34932920390774447,0.4894589185502704,0.5349805062531007,0.3875349080156341,0.4100510851362654,0.6479760703208691,0,0.4460795064310565,0,0.12160832278925911,0.02811753128075355,0.1282159426402362,0.27344299170532826,-0.2416294528097924,0.7265570082946717,60
3,"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 The tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. By Lawrence Davidson For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) For our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? The short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. But the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government’s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. What we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. So the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. On March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? The various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out – specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. A “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” Despite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want – a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. The Believers It is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth – that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere.

However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors – those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview – have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. Listen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council – yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We’re looking for truth. But we’re particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? I can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview – their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. On the other hand, as long as what you’re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory – the list is almost endless. What does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers – the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class – presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. It has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare’s determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will – no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

4,"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. The US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. Rais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. At the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. In both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

5,"Print An Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran’s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she’d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. “When the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment – without a warrant – and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,” the article stated. “One of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery – never published, never presented to anyone,” the article stated. “The narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.",1,153,38.25,4,0.3660130718954248,0,0,0,0,97.47561837837254,1.0891804434191974,83.65980392156862,37.32582909707093,0.7450980392156863,0,0.013071895424836602,0.0392156862745098,0.006535947712418301,0.013071895424836602,0.16993464052287582,0,0,0.013071895424836602,0.13071895424836602,0,0.058823529411764705,0,0,0,0.013071895424836602,0.0392156862745098,0,0.06535947712418301,0.006535947712418301,0.0196078431372549,0.006535947712418301,0.013071895424836602,0.006535947712418301,0,0.0784313725490196,0,0.013071895424836602,0,0.05228758169934641,0,0,0.0784313725490196,0,0,0.43137254901960786,0,0,0.013071895424836602,0,0.0392156862745098,0,0,0.013071895424836602,0.0196078431372549,0.013071895424836602,0.006535947712418301,0,0.013071895424836602,0.0196078431372549,0,0,0,0.032679738562091505,0.16993464052287582,0.0196078431372549,0,0.013071895424836602,0.032679738562091505,0.0915032679738562,0.032679738562091505,0.006535947712418301,0.05228758169934641,0.1437908496732026,0.0718954248366013,0,0,0.032679738562091505,0.0718954248366013,0.006535947712418301,0,0.013071895424836602,0,0.013071895424836602,0,0,0.0196078431372549,0.12418300653594772,0.0196078431372549,0,0.006535947712418301,0.013071895424836602,0.0392156862745098,0.09803921568627451,0.10457516339869281,0,0.0457516339869281,0,5,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,34,39,5,,0.3585701736362871,0,0.6799246751246121,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7642787314192173,0,0,0,0,0.6414298263637128,0,0.0273224043715847,0,0.18579234972677597,0.21311475409836064,-0.8209586712986692,0.7868852459016393,9
6,"In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason. [In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie discusses the looming threat of North Korea, and explains how President Donald Trump could win the support of the Hollywood left if the U. S. needs to strike first.  “If he decides to bomb them, the whole country will be behind him, because everybody will realize he had no choice and that was the only thing to do,” Jackie says. “Except the Hollywood left. They’ll get nauseous. ” “[Trump] could win the left over, they’ll fall in love with him in a minute. If he bombed them for a better reason,” Jackie explains. “Like if they have no transgender toilets. ” Jackie also says it’s no surprise that Hollywood celebrities didn’t support Trump’s strike on a Syrian airfield this month. “They were infuriated,” he says. “Because it might only save lives.

7,"Ever wonder how Britain’s most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight? Here are the six pictures of sharks Sir Elton John likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. A Shark Swimming Sit next to Elton John on a flight and you’ll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animal’s triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air When you’re an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton John’s seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the shark’s beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl Rumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform “Candle In The Wind” at Princess Diana’s funeral. It’s been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks How does the man behind “Tiny Dancer” and “Rocket Man” handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that “Fasten Seat Belts” sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws Sir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever he’s on a long flight, gently tracing the shark’s teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilot’s Choice As much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. That’s why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. So yeah—it’s good to be Elton!",1,512,20.48,25,0.2578125,0,0,0,0,98.05299698004202,25.194556451612904,77.68844696969697,81.93243243243244,0.77734375,0.0078125,0.04296875,0.037109375,0.03125,0.005859375,0.1328125,0,0,0.02734375,0.1015625,0.00390625,0.033203125,0.0234375,0.017578125,0.013671875,0.013671875,0.046875,0,0.021484375,0.017578125,0.04296875,0.015625,0.001953125,0.001953125,0.001953125,0.044921875,0.001953125,0,0.009765625,0.001953125,0,0.0078125,0.009765625,0,0,0.435546875,0.001953125,0.005859375,0.005859375,0,0.0390625,0.00390625,0,0.0078125,0.015625,0.013671875,0.046875,0.00390625,0.046875,0.001953125,0,0,0,0.04296875,0.201171875,0.00390625,0,0.06640625,0.04296875,0.03515625,0.04296875,0.03125,0.021484375,0.17578125,0.08203125,0.01171875,0.00390625,0.015625,0.1953125,0,0.017578125,0,0,0.05078125,0,0,0.033203125,0.07421875,0.08984375,0,0.01171875,0.00390625,0.064453125,0.08203125,0.095703125,0,0.009765625,0.005859375,23.080000000000002,0,3,4,18,10.7,0,0,28,4,8.73,28.455,49,0,23.080000000000002,0,128.535,10.7,14,149.885,128.535,,0.5079149368865503,0,0.1182933591140401,0.15174115516527187,0.44597861335205763,0.323647307702725,0,0,0.5559893179579538,0.15174115516527187,0.280791544706603,0.5599649581781311,0.6866526517754357,0,0.2384140985032933,0,0.20277337371920773,0.016880033444552245,0.022086025067638453,0.23645456194735637,0.8786971506694232,0.7635454380526436,28
8,"PARIS  —   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday’s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoît Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would “make France’s heart beat,” bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls’s 41 percent. “Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,” Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. “Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,” he said. Mr. Hamon’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, François Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France’s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande’s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon’s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande’s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. “We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,” Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande’s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France’s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). “We have someone that trusts us,” Mr. Kekenbosch said, “who says: ‘I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald’s on provisional contracts for 4 years. ” Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.",0,831,25.181818181818183,33,0.345367027677497,0,0,0,0,95.70671194709067,9.459680325249678,86.5891278187621,73.0179302045728,0.7942238267148014,0.03369434416365824,0.056558363417569195,0.030084235860409144,0.03850782190132371,0.026474127557160047,0.16365824308062576,0,0.0024067388688327317,0.01444043321299639,0.0914560770156438,0,0.05415162454873646,0.0048134777376654635,0.0024067388688327317,0.018050541516245487,0.007220216606498195,0.07220216606498195,0.0012033694344163659,0.06498194945848375,0.021660649819494584,0.05054151624548736,0,0,0.013237063778580024,0.015643802647412757,0.12515042117930206,0,0.0036101083032490976,0.007220216606498195,0.0036101083032490976,0,0.009626955475330927,0.04332129963898917,0,0,0.4380264741275572,0.0024067388688327317,0.007220216606498195,0,0.0012033694344163659,0.039711191335740074,0.0012033694344163659,0,0.006016847172081829,0.01684717208182912,0.006016847172081829,0.04693140794223827,0.01684717208182912,0.019253910950661854,0.0024067388688327317,0.006016847172081829,0,0.0012033694344163659,0.032490974729241874,0.23345367027677497,0.0024067388688327317,0.0012033694344163659,0.024067388688327317,0.06377858002406739,0.06979542719614922,0.03850782190132371,0.031287605294825514,0.07220216606498195,0.1552346570397112,0.07821901323706378,0.021660649819494584,0,0.015643802647412757,0.15042117930204574,0.0024067388688327317,0.00842358604091456,0.0024067388688327317,0.0036101083032490976,0.015643802647412757,0,0,0.024067388688327317,0.11672683513838748,0.08543922984356198,0,0.01444043321299639,0.0024067388688327317,0.0457280385078219,0.11552346570397112,0.11311672683513839,0.006016847172081829,0.05776173285198556,0.0048134777376654635,34,0,7,3.5,2,3.3,16.875,13.425,14.65,24.375,8.95,23.725,33.225,0,34,0.325,109.55,21.175,51.8,175.89999999999998,109.55,,0.5696052109894582,0,0.21412971538676237,0.11990216603729201,0.0722270279186898,0.11383052952379388,0.39644815198487104,0.3432146325245514,0.363158925978273,0.48686254933219514,0.2583683550249929,0.48011285382953944,0.5639436082066841,0,0.4873745045231296,0.01249256924811995,0.11448427212874908,0.022128749085588883,0.054133138258961225,0.18382276099905945,0.7607101856634327,0.8161772390009405,50
9,"Donald J. Trump is scheduled to make a highly anticipated visit to an   church in Detroit on Saturday, the first such visit of his campaign. There, he will participate in a    session conducted by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the church, Great Faith Ministries International. Given the importance of the visit, the Trump team went so far as to script Mr. Trump’s answers to Bishop Jackson’s questions, which were submitted in advance. After this article was published on Thursday night, a campaign official said that Mr. Trump would also speak to the church’s congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate and Detroit native. Below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by The New York Times. _____ Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand. Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a   society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together. _____ Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate. Second I need to know how would you change that perception in our community? The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer. We need to get people off welfare and back to work. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Republicans have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction. _____ Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can’t afford it, yet need it the most? As President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it. This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options. _____ Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you? All votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighbor’s vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity  —   not   outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side. If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8% and climbing.",0,1440,19.726027397260275,73,0.2847222222222222,0,0,0,0,68.59013605442176,9.090709353421218,85.28661616161617,90.21092278719397,0.8583333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.050694444444444445,0.03125,0.05138888888888889,0.044444444444444446,0.10555555555555556,0.0020833333333333333,0.004166666666666667,0.003472222222222222,0.059722222222222225,0,0.09583333333333334,0.00625,0,0.01875,0.03333333333333333,0.12638888888888888,0,0.03194444444444444,0.03263888888888889,0.06597222222222222,0,0.001388888888888889,0.025694444444444443,0.03263888888888889,0.12916666666666668,0,0.0006944444444444445,0.0006944444444444445,0,0,0.020833333333333332,0.015277777777777777,0.002777777777777778,0.002777777777777778,0.5263888888888889,0.005555555555555556,0.004166666666666667,0.004166666666666667,0.017361111111111112,0.06041666666666667,0,0,0.011805555555555555,0.013194444444444444,0.0020833333333333333,0.006944444444444444,0.017361111111111112,0.022222222222222223,0.010416666666666666,0.00625,0,0,0.011805555555555555,0.24375,0.015277777777777777,0,0.010416666666666666,0.05,0.07083333333333333,0.08263888888888889,0.04513888888888889,0.044444444444444446,0.1451388888888889,0.14305555555555555,0.02847222222222222,0.004861111111111111,0,0.10972222222222222,0.010416666666666666,0.02638888888888889,0.0020833333333333333,0,0.004166666666666667,0,0,0.0020833333333333333,0.10972222222222222,0.06527777777777778,0,0.027083333333333334,0.014583333333333334,0.02361111111111111,0.15486111111111112,0.14652777777777778,0.030555555555555555,0.044444444444444446,0.018055555555555554,124.125,0,32,2,27.625,11,44,15,46.625,40,47.625,29,68,3,124.125,3,282,60,87,425,282,,0.764622792513703,0,0.4557758788319707,0.0497389372927,0.4196099720886868,0.2235320461836756,0.5352150433618352,0.28190218237755793,0.5495966226953658,0.5114439002612571,0.5548439420735696,0.4314837546421364,0.6402413553293866,0.07279795937095576,0.3202280231369197,0.07279795937095576,0.1628175519630485,0.03464203233256351,0.05023094688221709,0.2453810623556582,0.8783051381262514,0.7546189376443417,133
10,"A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.",0,1746,17.11764705882353,102,0.32760595647193586,0,0,0,0,96.5592865324824,10.979263424624252,87.51434181920192,44.658556701030925,0.7777777777777778,0.022336769759450172,0.04524627720504009,0.021764032073310423,0.033218785796105384,0.022336769759450172,0.2016036655211913,0.004009163802978236,0.001718213058419244,0.011454753722794959,0.09106529209621993,0.000572737686139748,0.052691867124856816,0.004009163802978236,0,0.00859106529209622,0.005154639175257732,0.06586483390607102,0.001718213058419244,0.06242840778923253,0.019473081328751432,0.042382588774341354,0,0.000572737686139748,0.019473081328751432,0.012027491408934709,0.145475372279496,0.000572737686139748,0.001718213058419244,0.001718213058419244,0.001718213058419244,0,0.012600229095074456,0.06128293241695303,0.001145475372279496,0.001145475372279496,0.4163802978235968,0.002290950744558992,0.015463917525773196,0.005154639175257732,0.0057273768613974796,0.022909507445589918,0.0057273768613974796,0.001718213058419244,0.013172966781214204,0.011454753722794959,0.006300114547537228,0.07789232531500573,0.010882016036655211,0.018900343642611683,0.00859106529209622,0.010309278350515464,0.005154639175257732,0,0.01718213058419244,0.19759450171821305,0.003436426116838488,0.002290950744558992,0.025200458190148912,0.09965635738831616,0.08018327605956473,0.04524627720504009,0.020618556701030927,0.09163802978235967,0.14833906071019473,0.06815578465063,0.010309278350515464,0.001718213058419244,0.018327605956471937,0.143184421534937,0,0.011454753722794959,0.006300114547537228,0.001145475372279496,0.006872852233676976,0,0,0.033218785796105384,0.14490263459335626,0.08247422680412371,0,0.017754868270332187,0.002290950744558992,0.0429553264604811,0.11798396334478808,0.11397479954180985,0.001718213058419244,0.06357388316151202,0.002290950744558992,35,0,87.2,0,67,17.125,35,42,3.73,42,36,24,46,0,35,7,205.73,58.125,177.2,415.055,205.73,,0.4365921112749326,0,0.6587776573420674,0,0.597327046185992,0.2749177450970934,0.4365921112749326,0.4818372638655221,0.07628379830081952,0.4818372638655221,0.44353350786507384,0.3469894944679485,0.5045720858281112,0,0.31738182765068296,0.1341860944941306,0.10001191023088833,0.02825641511772899,0.08614256789439272,0.20177146454518718,0.4718241841360453,0.7982285354548129,104
11,"Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest President Donald Trump’s agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocate[ing] for the president’s policies. ” In a recent Facebook post titled, “Take a deep breath. Then take action,” OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. “Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,” the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. ” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. ” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions  —   while keeping “a firm hold on the mic”  —   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers. ” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says.   …    “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. ” Sperry reported OFA “plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. ” Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that “conservatives” are “spreading unfounded rumors” that the group is “being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. ” Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet’s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed “Indivisible,” the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump’s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have “signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. ” The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group’s website states: “What’s more, you all are putting the guide into action —  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You’re resisting —  and it’s working. ” Politico reported on “unfounded” rumors being spread about Soros’s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): “It doesn’t matter who we take money from  —   we’re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don’t take money from Soros,” said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. “That’s one of the attacks and that’s fine. ” While “Indivisible” has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico’s claim about “unfounded rumors” that Indivisibles’ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump’s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla’s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible’s ties to the organizers of last month’s   Women’s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women’s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women’s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

12,"The BBC produced spoof on the “Real Housewives” TV programmes, which has a comedic Islamic State twist, has been criticised by Leftists and Muslims who claim the sketch is offensive. [The BBC released the trailer earlier this week and were immediately slammed by those on the left and Muslims who thought that making fun of the brides of members of the terror group was out of the bounds of conventional humour. The sketch is part of a new programme called “Revolting” written by Jolyon Rubinstein and Heydon Prowse which, according to the BBC, is “satirising the state of the nation. ”  LOLOLOL pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 4, 2017,  The BBC2 Facebook page was inundated with criticism. One user wrote, “I’m mortified that the BBC had produced such a programme. This is simply bad taste. The fact it is a comedy makes it even more worrying that humour should be associated with the actions of ISIS. Is this really what TV licenses are funding! ?” Others took a different point of view including a Muslim saying, “As a Muslim I find this HILARIOUS! Brilliant! The satire is on point highlighting the pathetic ideals of a pathetic group like ISIS. ” Not all Muslims agreed with the sentiment and users on Twitter expressed just as much outrage for the sketch. One man, a Bangladeshi, said “The BBC really made a satirical show called ‘The Real Housewives of ISIS’ while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily. ”   The BBC really made a satirical show called ”The Real Housewives of ISIS” while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily,  —   Meraj.

Thanks @BBC for adding to the negative stereotype,  —   aѕн (@AshKaneSkittles) January 4, 2017,  Leftists also articulated how offended they were that the public broadcaster would dare create such a sketch mocking Islamic State. Some questioned whether the use of taxpayer money via the TV license fee should go toward the funding of the programme. As if people’s TV license in this country is going towards funding the production of a programme called ”the real housewives of ISIS”. Wow,  —   Cameron Edgar (@CammyyyEdgar) January 4, 2017,    The video itself has already been viewed millions of times on Facebook and other social media platforms.  The clip shows several women in hijabs talking to each other in a    house taking selfies and showing off their suicide belts to each other. One woman even mentions that she hadn’t come from Birmingham “to do this” as she scrubbed the floor of the home. Women joining Islamic State and travelling to Syria to become brides has become a real problem in European countries as the terror group promises young girls a more glamorous lifestyle. In 2014, eight schoolgirls from Bethnal Green travelled to Syria to become brides of Islamic State fighters, all of them under the age of 18.",0,520,19.25925925925926,27,0.3384615384615385,0,0,0,0,96.4720202874049,5.044159544159543,71.15641025641025,12.902668759811615,0.8057692307692308,0.0038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.025,0.0673076923076923,0.019230769230769232,0.18076923076923077,0.021153846153846155,0.0057692307692307696,0.013461538461538462,0.11153846153846154,0,0.06923076923076923,0.007692307692307693,0,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0.07884615384615384,0,0.04230769230769231,0.023076923076923078,0.04038461538461539,0,0.0019230769230769232,0.021153846153846155,0.011538461538461539,0.04807692307692308,0.0057692307692307696,0,0.0038461538461538464,0.03461538461538462,0,0.0057692307692307696,0.046153846153846156,0,0,0.4346153846153846,0,0.0038461538461538464,0.019230769230769232,0.0038461538461538464,0.04807692307692308,0.007692307692307693,0.0038461538461538464,0.015384615384615385,0.013461538461538462,0.026923076923076925,0.0019230769230769232,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,0.007692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.007692307692307693,0,0.03076923076923077,0.25,0.021153846153846155,0.007692307692307693,0.026923076923076925,0.046153846153846156,0.10192307692307692,0.013461538461538462,0.028846153846153848,0.011538461538461539,0.13653846153846153,0.06153846153846154,0.03461538461538462,0.0019230769230769232,0.04230769230769231,0.08653846153846154,0.021153846153846155,0.009615384615384616,0.0038461538461538464,0.007692307692307693,0.01730769230769231,0,0.0038461538461538464,0.0038461538461538464,0.08846153846153847,0.046153846153846156,0,0.0057692307692307696,0.0057692307692307696,0.03076923076923077,0.11346153846153846,0.13846153846153847,0,0.023076923076923078,0,19.855,30.560000000000002,74.5,0,0,0,3,60.9,4.83,56,2,0,0,0,19.855,0,62.295,9.5,185.15,256.94500000000005,62.295,,0.46074875360928813,0.5680519119913809,0.7622426913318266,0,0,0,0.11433841851550566,0.7238117417250671,0.17208269898024284,0.7067325098899491,0.07924589581061381,0,0,0,0.6679726059562122,0,0.08593065680844754,0.013104442405975626,0.2553986854175144,0.35443378463193764,-0.8820298027672919,0.6455662153680624,52
13,"The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.Nazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.During the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named “Schatzgraber” or “Treasure Hunter,” which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darré, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.However, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944 – a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of “Treasure Hunter,” some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.But Russian researchers have now announced that “Treasure Hunter” has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.A senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : “Before it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.”",1,455,30.333333333333332,15,0.3956043956043956,0,0,0,0,98.14329000831101,43.373333333333335,56.99296703296704,6.327583808596468,0.7186813186813187,0.013186813186813187,0.02197802197802198,0.041758241758241756,0.035164835164835165,0.006593406593406593,0.15824175824175823,0.015384615384615385,0.002197802197802198,0,0.12747252747252746,0,0.04835164835164835,0.006593406593406593,0,0.01978021978021978,0.008791208791208791,0.09010989010989011,0.002197802197802198,0.07252747252747253,0.013186813186813187,0.04395604395604396,0.013186813186813187,0.01098901098901099,0.01978021978021978,0.002197802197802198,0.06373626373626373,0,0,0.002197802197802198,0,0,0.006593406593406593,0.05054945054945055,0.002197802197802198,0.002197802197802198,0.4197802197802198,0.004395604395604396,0.004395604395604396,0,0,0.035164835164835165,0.002197802197802198,0.002197802197802198,0.026373626373626374,0.008791208791208791,0,0,0.006593406593406593,0.01098901098901099,0.002197802197802198,0.026373626373626374,0.002197802197802198,0,0.026373626373626374,0.15164835164835164,0.002197802197802198,0.002197802197802198,0.01098901098901099,0.04395604395604396,0.05274725274725275,0.006593406593406593,0.008791208791208791,0.04395604395604396,0.13406593406593406,0.041758241758241756,0.017582417582417582,0,0.02197802197802198,0.15604395604395604,0.002197802197802198,0.004395604395604396,0.004395604395604396,0.004395604395604396,0.004395604395604396,0,0,0,0.035164835164835165,0.09010989010989011,0,0.02197802197802198,0.002197802197802198,0.05714285714285714,0.08791208791208792,0.07912087912087912,0.002197802197802198,0.03296703296703297,0.002197802197802198,0,0,144.375,0,0,1,0,11,11,131.5,8.25,17,12,0,0,0,33.25,3,185.875,215.625,33.25,,0,0,0.8928819465561089,0,0,0.054583639049126324,0,0.38841111079651675,0.38841111079651675,0.8836147766215143,0.32263731231229265,0.49533066242810353,0.4092698519760594,0,0.8639613653961216,0,0.052977494523003384,0.0047799243178649675,0.2961561441943836,0.34355706034654454,-0.925715613436618,0.6564429396534555,43
14,"Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign’s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D – NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret “explosive” evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they’ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming “everyone knows” that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI’s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven’t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn’t stop Clinton from calling Trump a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday’s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. With Clinton’s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won’t be happening.

15,"Guillermo Barros Schelotto was not the first Argentine player to set foot on a Major League Soccer field. Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007. But Schelotto’s phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires. “Most of them like to talk about the cities,” Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come. Argentines now make up the   demographic in M. L. S. trailing only Americans. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, going into this season’s openers, 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M. L. S.   game since the league’s inception. Sebastian Blanco, a new designated player for Portland, made his debut in an opener Friday and became No. 99. In a ranking by nationality, Argentines have the   goal total, too. Twelve of the 22 teams in M. L. S. will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster, a list that includes stars like Dallas’s Mauro Diaz and Montreal’s Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlanta’s Hector Villalba and New York City F. C.’s Maxi Moralez. Why do they come? For some it’s the money, or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly. Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the “quiet, clean” life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio. The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason. A year before he signed with Portland, while under contract to his hometown club Lanus, Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife, Florencia, and daughter, Connie, inside. “After that moment,” Valeri said with considerable understatement, “we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world. ” Within a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. “Situations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change,” he said. The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M. L. S. Cup championship game. “I think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here,” Caleb Porter, Valeri’s coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. “They really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle that’s different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M. L. S. ” Since 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its   acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador  —   he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbers’ general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentina’s outsize presence in M. L. S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires. “Certain countries produce certain positions more,” Porter said. “Most teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina. ” A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M. L. S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said. But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the league’s overall transfer policy. As the quality of M. L. S. has improved as it enters its third decade, its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports  —   which in the past had trended toward aging, often European stars  —   and more toward onfield impact and value. The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift, as they enter a league where the average age of designated players  —   the team’s   stars  —   has fallen below 28, its lowest point in a decade. “They know that M. L. S. is different to 10 years ago,” said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. “They can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe. “Ten years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can. ” There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe. “People are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers,” Ignacio Piatti, a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. “It’s what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games. ” Piatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M. L. S. including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F. C. both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing. At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez  —   who spent four years in Italy  —   reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the league’s standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly. “First off, I just want to enjoy football,” Moralez said. “But also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country.

The move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed, only to be undone by a   sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years. It was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry, which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis. Despite the industry’s many troubles, relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure. But Wells Fargo’s transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward, which contributed to the   public outcry. This time, there were no exotic financial instruments, complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery. The bank’s misdeeds were fundamentally simple: Under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, employees created sham accounts using the names  —   and sometimes, the actual money  —   of the bank’s real customers. And in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees. The reaction to the fake accounts at Wells Fargo, and to Mr. Stumpf’s response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem, has been withering and unrelenting. Wells Fargo has been under fire from irate customers, regulators, lawmakers and former employees since last month, when it disclosed that it would pay $185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals. The sales practices may reach back far longer. Former bank employees told The New York Times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago. Mr. Stumpf, 63, who was twice called in front of Congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks, faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public, but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the Wells Fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports   earnings on Friday. He potentially walks away with millions of dollars, including a $20 million pension, as of Wednesday, another $4. 3 million in deferred compensation, plus stock worth $109 million, according to data from Equilar. As the scandal erupted, Mr. Stumpf, who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in Minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots, was unable to quell the uproar. Rather, he often seemed to inflame it. During his testimony in front of Congress, Mr. Stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems, but would not admit that there anything wrong with the bank’s broader culture. When pressed repeatedly by members of the Senate Banking Committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation, Mr. Stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him, but to the bank’s board. He was reminded that he was the board’s chairman. One senator on the banking committee noted that criticism of the Wells Fargo scandal was one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans had agreed on in a long time. Mr. Stumpf’s spent 34 years at a bank that had once been regarded as a darling on Wall Street because of its ability to churn out profits even as other banks struggled. Mr. Stumpf was named chief executive in 2007 and was one of the country’s   bankers, earning about $19 million last year. He was named the 2013 Banker of the Year by the trade publication American Banker. Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank as measured by the price of its stock, which attracted the billionaire Warren E. Buffett as its largest shareholder. Mr. Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, has a stake of about 10 percent. Mr. Buffett did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Wells Fargo has since ceded the most valuable bank distinction to JPMorgan Chase. The board received a letter from Mr. Stumpf early on Wednesday indicating that he intended to retire, according to a person briefed on the matter. This person said the board was still in the early stages of conducting its investigation into the fake accounts and Mr. Stumpf’s handling of the scandal and had not drawn any conclusions from its inquiry. The board was not scheduled to meet on Wednesday when it received Mr. Stumpf’s letter, which this person described as brief and lacking any indication as to why the longtime C. E. O. decided to leave now. Top bank executives were expecting that Mr. Stumpf would address analysts and investors  —   as he has always done  —   when Wells Fargo reports its   results on Friday. Wells Fargo said Mr. Stumpf would be replaced by Timothy J. Sloan, its president and chief operating officer. Just two days earlier, the San Francisco bank shuffled its top management to give more responsibility to Mr. Sloan. “I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo,” Mr. Stumpf said in a written statement. “While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. ” Mr. Sloan was informed early Wednesday that he was the bank’s new C. E. O. though he had known for several days that Mr. Stumpf was preparing to step down. In an interview, Mr. Sloan said Mr. Stumpf had told him of his decision to retire after concluding that he would most likely continue to be the focus of much of the criticism being leveled at the bank. “It was an incredibly selfless decision,” Mr. Sloan said. Federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney began looking into the issue in 2013. The deal Wells Fargo announced last month to settle cases brought by their offices was intended to resolve the matter, but it instead opened the floodgates, provoking a furious outpouring of questions, criticism and new information about what former employees say was a   culture of toxic sales pressure. The Department of Justice and Labor Department opened their own inquiries. Mr. Sloan said the bank had already named a new head of community banking, ended the retail banking sales goals that employees blamed for putting them under undue pressure and extended its review of its sales practices back to 2009. Originally, the bank’s review covered its activities only between 2011 and 2015. Mr. Sloan will not hold the dual of roles of chief executive and chairman as Mr. Stump had. Mr. Stumpf agreed last month to surrender stock grants valued at $41 million  —   another highly unusual move on Wall Street, where clawback provisions have been widely adopted but are almost never deployed. Mr. Stumpf said he would give up his $2. 8 million annual salary for the duration of the board’s investigation. Because his departure is a resignation, Mr. Stumpf will leave without any severance, according to Oscar Suris, a company spokesman. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who blasted Mr. Stumpf when he appeared before the Senate last month, fired off a scathing statement on Wednesday. “As I said at the hearing last month, Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was going on, and face an investigation by the Justice Department and S. E. C. ,” she said. “So far, he’s one for three. ”",0,1261,19.4,65,0.33068992862807295,0,0,0,0,92.41013727088941,19.227435603724267,73.44956383822363,14.761120322975993,0.8176050753370341,0.013481363996827915,0.045995241871530534,0.03013481363996828,0.0317208564631245,0.003965107057890563,0.15305313243457574,0.006344171292624901,0.004758128469468675,0.013481363996827915,0.08088818398096749,0,0.063441712926249,0.003965107057890563,0.0015860428231562252,0.017446471054718478,0.006344171292624901,0.08247422680412371,0.0007930214115781126,0.047581284694686754,0.02775574940523394,0.05392545598731166,0,0,0.01823949246629659,0.011102299762093577,0.09119746233148295,0,0,0.0015860428231562252,0.0007930214115781126,0,0.0055511498810467885,0.07454401268834258,0.0007930214115781126,0.0007930214115781126,0.4337827121332276,0.0023790642347343376,0.011102299762093577,0.0015860428231562252,0.003965107057890563,0.04837430610626487,0.0015860428231562252,0,0.0190325138778747,0.01506740681998414,0,0.04361617763679619,0.056304520222045996,0.016653449643140365,0.00951625693893735,0.019825535289452814,0.0015860428231562252,0,0.03251387787470262,0.21252973830293417,0.00951625693893735,0,0.014274385408406027,0.07375099127676447,0.10547184773988898,0.029341792228390166,0.011895321173671689,0.06740681998413957,0.14512291831879462,0.07771609833465504,0.01586042823156225,0,0.007930214115781126,0.14908802537668517,0,0.008723235527359239,0.0055511498810467885,0.0023790642347343376,0.0015860428231562252,0,0,0.02141157811260904,0.0943695479777954,0.06740681998413957,0,0.01506740681998414,0.003965107057890563,0.07057890563045202,0.10864393338620143,0.10864393338620143,0,0.08643933386201427,0,56.5,0,97.2,0,0,5.75,9,63.25,7,55.925000000000004,21,9,37.2,0,56.5,0,95.95,22.75,201.92499999999998,317.9,95.95,,0.6104444599618687,0,0.7294257324946247,0,0,0.13754166905563958,0.19975358063310833,0.6369233514384602,0.16258080678055895,0.6080092220096794,0.368062593536016,0.19975358063310833,0.5078116117294369,0,0.3451062218723727,0,0.06401360998065247,0.015177797051170857,0.13471545800253518,0.2120888651677897,-0.8060768338991751,0.7879111348322103,80
17,"A Caddo Nation tribal leader has just been freed after spending two days behind bars in North Dakota. Family members say she was simply an innocent bystander in a clash between police and protesters, and was not guilty of anything the police claimed. Via AlternativeNews Jessi Mitchell, of local News 9 reports that “family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site.”They added, however, that Francis-Fourkiller was never supposed to have been arrested in the first place. “An expert on sacred burial grounds , Francis-Fourkiller was one of the tribal leaders visiting the Sioux of Standing Rock to advise them during negotiations with the Dakota Access Pipeline construction team,” Mitchell continues. “Remains were being desecrated in this pipeline, so they had asked a bunch of people to come up there, so there’s a big conference,” Francis-Fourkiller’s sister Loretta Francis explained.On the visit , Francis said her sister and other leaders decided to tour the protest camps. They never thought they would wind up in jail. Francis said her sister had no access to her medication while in custody in Cass County, North Dakota, and now faces charges of conspiracy and rioting. “Part of my family was removed on the Trail of Tears and they came here to Oklahoma and they suffered,” said Francis. “I always feel like each generation – our parents, our grandparents – try to make it better for the next generation and they certainly didn’t want this for my sister.”Dozens of Native Americans from Oklahoma tribes had gathered Saturday afternoon at the state Capitol, according to Mitchell, with the purpose of voicing their “anger at the treatment of the protesters in North Dakota, pointing out this week’s acquittal of armed protesters at an Oregon wildlife refuge earlier this year.”“We’re not holding guns. We’re not armed, and when we see the military right here in the US use that on us, it’s shameful,” Comanche Nation tribal council member Sonya Nevaquaya explained.One of the fundamentals of all Native American tribes is the protection of the land. Chanting “Water is life!” Saturday, the Oklahoma demonstrators hope to rally people from around the country to stand with those in North Dakota and stop construction on the pipeline project. “These pipelines, you hear of a lot of bursts and leaks and it contaminating the waters. What happens when all of our waters and resources are gone?” Nevaquaya explained.

18,"FBI Closes In On Hillary! Posted on Home » Headlines » World News » FBI Closes In On Hillary! We now have 5 separate FBI cases probing the Hillary-Bill Clinton inner circle. Here is the background on those 5 cases and all of the major players that we are going to cover: FIVE INVESTIGATIONS UNDERGOING BY THE FBI ON CLINTON, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND INNER CIRCLE/TRUMP SURPASSES CLINTON IN THE POLLS/DEUTSCHE BANK STOCK PLUMMETS AGAIN/DB’S CHIEF ECONOMIST BLASTS THE ECB AGAIN: THEY MUST BE HURTING!/569,000 OZ ADDED TO THE SLV/2.67 TONNES ADDED TO THE GLD Gold closed at $1306.40 up $20.40 silver closed at $18.66 or up 47 cents. Access market prices: THE DAILY GOLD FIX REPORT FROM SHANGHAI AND LONDON . The Shanghai fix is at 10:15 pm est and 2:15 am est The fix for London is at 5:30 am est (first fix) and 10 am est (second fix) Thus Shanghai’s second fix corresponds to 195 minutes before London’s first fix. And now the fix recordings: Shanghai morning fix Nov 2 ( 10:15 pm est last night): $ 1294.53 NY ACCESS PRICE: $1289.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME) Shanghai afternoon fix: 2: 15 am est (second fix/early morning):$ 1296.08 NY ACCESS PRICE: 1291.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME/2:15 am) HUGE SPREAD TODAY!! 4 dollars London Fix: Nov 2: 5:30 am est : $1295.85 (NY: same time: $1296.10: 5:30AM ) London Second fix Nov 2: 10 am est : $1303.75 (NY same time: $1301.75 , 10 AM ) Shanghai premium in silver over NY: 59 cents. It seems that Shanghai pricing is higher than the other two , (NY and London). The spread has been occurring on a regular basis and thus I expect to see arbitrage happening as investors buy the lower priced NY gold and sell to China at the higher price. This should drain the comex. Also why would mining companies hand in their gold to the comex and receive constantly lower prices. They would be open to lawsuits if they knowingly continue to supply the comex despite the fact that they could be receiving higher prices in Shanghai. end NOTICES FILINGS FOR NOVEMBER CONTRACT MONTH: 381 NOTICES FOR 38,100 OZ TONES NOTICES FOR NOVEMBER CONTRACT MONTH FOR SILVER: 12 NOTICES OR 60,000 OZ Let us have a look at the data for today .

19,"Wednesday after   Donald Trump’s press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, NBC “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd expressed his exasperation over the normalcy of what he called a “circus” surrounding Trump’s event.  “I was struck big picture wise which is of how normal a circus is now to us,” Todd said. “This was a circus. We’ve never seen a   a transition like we saw today where the press conference gets interrupted, you have a lawyer in here. The lawyer does half legal talk, half political spin. I’ve never seen that, using the lawyer to say he’s here to make America great again, and by the way I’m going to play constitutional lawyer. I don’t think this but clearly a constitutional lawyer told us we better not accept any of this money. So they made that exception. So I am struck at how normal crazy looked to us today. This was just a crazy scene, but this is the norm of Donald Trump. And in fact, this is where he’s most comfortable. And I will say this. just as a political show. if you’re Donald Trump, you want these press conferences because it made the press look disjointed, unorganized, all this stuff. And his people, you know, he just, it was a performance for his supporters and his people. ” Later in the segment, Todd decried what he saw as elements within the intelligence community being at odds with one another, then called a story put out by BuzzFeed a night earlier suggesting Trump had ties to Russia to be a “political favor. ” “Look, let’s be honest here,” Todd said. “Politically BuzzFeed did Donald Trump a political favor today by doing what they did by going ahead and making it all public because it allowed them to deny a specific without having to deal with the bigger picture. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0,325,17.105263157894736,19,0.23076923076923078,0,0,0,0,62.17094017094016,11.667159763313611,85.93006993006993,66.53296703296704,0.8553846153846154,0.006153846153846154,0.07692307692307693,0.052307692307692305,0.046153846153846156,0.03076923076923077,0.19076923076923077,0.003076923076923077,0,0.03076923076923077,0.08,0,0.08307692307692308,0.003076923076923077,0,0.03076923076923077,0.021538461538461538,0.09230769230769231,0,0.055384615384615386,0.027692307692307693,0.055384615384615386,0,0,0.018461538461538463,0.006153846153846154,0.09538461538461539,0,0,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0.015384615384615385,0.06461538461538462,0,0,0.5046153846153846,0,0.012307692307692308,0,0.018461538461538463,0.06461538461538462,0.003076923076923077,0.003076923076923077,0.012307692307692308,0.024615384615384615,0.009230769230769232,0.027692307692307693,0.006153846153846154,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.012307692307692308,0.003076923076923077,0,0.009230769230769232,0.31076923076923074,0.006153846153846154,0,0.05846153846153846,0.055384615384615386,0.06153846153846154,0.08923076923076922,0.033846153846153845,0.052307692307692305,0.11384615384615385,0.15384615384615385,0.018461538461538463,0,0.043076923076923075,0.12307692307692308,0,0.009230769230769232,0,0,0.03076923076923077,0,0,0.027692307692307693,0.12615384615384614,0.05846153846153846,0,0.009230769230769232,0.009230769230769232,0.04923076923076923,0.18461538461538463,0.18153846153846154,0.021538461538461538,0.046153846153846156,0.012307692307692308,30.2,0,18.725,2,13.4,2,4,3,1,9.725,10,2,17,0,30.2,4,62.6,8,35.725,104.325,62.6,,0.6077242718095229,0,0.48994483161244107,0.09305100366818048,0.4073742189227711,0.09305100366818048,0.17025921636942778,0.13337133711281343,0.04879574852141934,0.3328360621146472,0.339056738914926,0.09305100366818048,0.4658352497088437,0,0.23535329109798714,0.17025921636942778,0.1559833053011898,0.01993396872858656,0.08901762910359436,0.2599514109512241,0.6609844751623314,0.7400485890487759,28
20,"Email Since Donald Trump entered the election over a year ago, he has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, leaving both the House and the Senate in utter disarray. But although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives shouldn’t lose hope yet, because Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new Republican Party. A fresh GOP platform requires fresh leadership, and when Speaker Ryan journeyed to South America last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved he’s the only one for the job. After traveling to Peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of DMT, and a bucket to vomit in, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate GOP unfold before his very eyes. While under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of Republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a Republican Party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. Check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the Amazon rain forest! Whoa. Democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if Paul Ryan’s visions of the Republican party are right, they better watch out! Say what you want about Paul Ryan, but he’s a man who refuses to give up. On the one hand, is it possible that the speaker’s grand ayahuasca visions of a new Republican Party are just a temporary fix? Sure. But on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind. One thing is for sure: Paul Ryan emerged fully nude from that ayahuasca tent with a new perspective, and people are starting to take notice.",1,384,27.428571428571427,14,0.3046875,0,0,0,0,93.96496383363473,15.237103174603174,74.25940860215054,69.92410714285714,0.7734375,0.020833333333333332,0.057291666666666664,0.033854166666666664,0.049479166666666664,0.013020833333333334,0.1171875,0.005208333333333333,0,0.013020833333333334,0.09375,0,0.049479166666666664,0.026041666666666668,0.020833333333333332,0.010416666666666666,0.018229166666666668,0.09114583333333333,0.0026041666666666665,0.057291666666666664,0.0234375,0.057291666666666664,0.005208333333333333,0,0.026041666666666668,0.015625,0.0703125,0.005208333333333333,0,0.005208333333333333,0,0.0026041666666666665,0.0026041666666666665,0.036458333333333336,0,0,0.4505208333333333,0.005208333333333333,0.010416666666666666,0.005208333333333333,0,0.033854166666666664,0.005208333333333333,0,0.018229166666666668,0.013020833333333334,0.020833333333333332,0.046875,0.0078125,0.018229166666666668,0.005208333333333333,0.013020833333333334,0.0026041666666666665,0,0.020833333333333332,0.20572916666666666,0,0.0026041666666666665,0.03125,0.028645833333333332,0.057291666666666664,0.052083333333333336,0.036458333333333336,0.041666666666666664,0.14583333333333334,0.0859375,0.015625,0.0026041666666666665,0,0.1640625,0.0026041666666666665,0.010416666666666666,0.0026041666666666665,0.0026041666666666665,0.015625,0,0.010416666666666666,0.044270833333333336,0.09375,0.0703125,0,0.018229166666666668,0.005208333333333333,0.07552083333333333,0.09375,0.109375,0,0.0234375,0.0026041666666666665,25.71,0,21,0,10.5,1,9,10,6.46,12,1,5.73,6.625,0,25.71,0,62.274999999999984,12,40,114.27500000000002,62.274999999999984,,0.6057507369505429,0,0.556539061215455,0,0.38555879571225843,0.05639139975154663,0.34974273756851054,0.3740666961489728,0.2785299075672752,0.4176353409424863,0.05639139975154663,0.2550838644819843,0.2836263003778016,0,0.29494547062671245,0,0.13529954918255385,0.026071370376405407,0.08690456792135136,0.2482754874803107,0.6530886852880852,0.7517245125196893,38
21,"Screenwriter Ryan Murphy, who has produced the   FX series American Crime Story, is set to bring the Monica   Clinton White House sex saga to TV. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Ryan Murphy Productions chief has optioned author and CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Tobin’s 2000 book A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.  The New York Times bestseller, acquired by Fox 21 Television Studios and FX Productions, will become the basis for a future American Crime Story season. In February, Murphy told E! News that the series would explore the Lewinsky sex scandal as “ ” plot to “tear down” President Bill Clinton, and on “the other women” who were ensnared in the 1996 sex scandal, involving   House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the events that led to Clinton’s impeachment. “It’s not really about Hillary Clinton. That book is about the rise of a certain segment of a   group of people who despised the Clintons and used three women, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp to try and tear him down,” Murphy said. In February, Murphy announced that actress Sarah Paulson  —   who starred in the first season of his crime drama, The People vs. O. J. Simpson  —   has been confirmed for a role, but ruled out that it would be of   Lady Hillary Clinton. The    mogul has reportedly confirmed that his studio is looking actresses to portray Lewinsky and Tripp. Season two of the Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy   show will tackle Hurricane Katrina, and is set to premier in 2018. Season three, he confirmed will focus on the 1997 assassination of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace, singer Ricky Martin has already joined the cast.

22,"Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” actor and director Rob Reiner accused President Donald Trump of being “mentally unstable. ”  Reiner said, “It’s scary, it’s scary, because if you look at the capacity that cyber warfare has, and if you know about Stuxnet, which some people do and don’t know about that, they were able to weaponize, you know, a cyber warfare and actually go in and blow up centrifuges in Iran.  That’s what scares me. We don’t have, anybody at the helm of our country right now. He is  —   you know, I hate to say it, we don’t want to use the word mentally ill, but he is mentally unstable, this man, and so who is going to take charge here when the next attack. ” “If the first attack, which was going into our elections, which we know happened, if it had been that a bomb blew up in New York, everybody would be going crazy, he continued. “That’s what happened. He blew up something. And now he could blow more stuff up. So we have to be  —   you know, we’ve got to make sure that our country is stable. And right now it’s not stable. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,211,17.583333333333332,12,0.18009478672985782,0,0,0,0,17.33475687030189,20.767333684395297,89.95674278328306,1,0.8436018957345972,0.009478672985781991,0.02843601895734597,0.04739336492890995,0.05687203791469194,0.04265402843601896,0.2559241706161137,0.02843601895734597,0.014218009478672985,0.04739336492890995,0.03317535545023697,0,0.12796208530805686,0.004739336492890996,0,0.014218009478672985,0.009478672985781991,0.11374407582938388,0,0.0995260663507109,0.004739336492890996,0.08056872037914692,0,0.009478672985781991,0.03317535545023697,0.03317535545023697,0.10900473933649289,0,0,0,0,0,0.014218009478672985,0.04265402843601896,0,0,0.5497630331753555,0.004739336492890996,0.009478672985781991,0,0.009478672985781991,0.10426540284360189,0.004739336492890996,0,0.02843601895734597,0.03317535545023697,0.009478672985781991,0.02843601895734597,0,0.023696682464454975,0.018957345971563982,0.04739336492890995,0.004739336492890996,0,0.004739336492890996,0.3080568720379147,0.014218009478672985,0,0.014218009478672985,0.052132701421800945,0.02843601895734597,0.0995260663507109,0.009478672985781991,0.04739336492890995,0.10426540284360189,0.2037914691943128,0.009478672985781991,0,0.04265402843601896,0.14691943127962084,0,0.009478672985781991,0,0,0.004739336492890996,0,0,0.023696682464454975,0.12796208530805686,0.08056872037914692,0,0.03317535545023697,0.004739336492890996,0.04265402843601896,0.23696682464454977,0.23696682464454977,0.037914691943127965,0.009478672985781991,0.023696682464454975,0,0,39,0,6,1,0,14,3,54,2,8,1,0,0,2,18,2,89,105,18,,0,0,0.7157022622885582,0,0.2791745113185196,0.060635704539036266,0,0.47470607699125783,0.16223290110168398,0.7770686088263072,0.11433841851550565,0.3405424265831667,0.060635704539036266,0,0,0.11433841851550565,0.0625,0.006944444444444444,0.3090277777777778,0.3645833333333333,-0.8663348848491493,0.6354166666666667,28
23,"Massachusetts Cop’s Wife Busted for Pinning Fake Home-Invasion Robbery on Black Lives Matter   Source: PINAC The wife of a Massachusetts cop is facing charges for filing a false police report after she concocted a story about thieves ransacking her home, stealing $10,000 in jewelry and then spray-painting her house with Black Lives Matter to pin it on black people. Maria Daly, wife of Millbury K-9 cop Daniel Daly, took to social media about her dreamt-up victimization after she filed a police report on October 17. “We woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping, but to see this hatred for no reason,” she posted, according to the Boston Herald. “ If you would of [sic] asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of [sic] been very positive [sic],” the now private Facebook account alleged. “Today on the other hand I have so much anger and hate that I don’t like myself. This is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.” Maria Daly called police to report someone had robbed her home while she was sleeping and then spray-painted her home with BLM for Black Lives Matter then posted about it on social media. Millbury Police Chief Donald Desourcy told the Herald that Daly called police to report an early morning break-in October 17, claiming someone had made off with thousands of dollars worth of valuables and spray-painting “BLM” on the outside of her house. But Chief Desourcy stated that as the investigation unfolded, something didn’t feel “quite right” and Daly ended up admitting she fabricated the whole thing, telling the officers her valuables had already been recovered. “It was pretty obvious. The officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had,” he told CBS Boston . “We came to the conclusion it was all fabricated. There was no intruder, there was no burglary.” The chief said the hoax was likely motivated by the couple’s financial troubles and that he has empathy for the family. “I’m very familiar with her and it’s an unfortunate set of circumstances that have taken place.” Daly’s neighbors said it wasn’t a very smart thing to do for a woman who is married to a cop. “She must have tagged the place herself,” said one neighbor. “I don’t know why you’d do that, if you’re gonna stage a robbery, I mean really come on, you’re a cop’s wife. You should know better.” In addition to charges for filing a false police report, Daly also faces a charge for misleading a police investigation. Her cases will be heard at Worcester District Court after she is summoned. Daly’s husband, Daniel Daly was not involved or charged in relation to the hoax, according to police.

24,"Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects, according to a women’s organization supplying such pills. Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2, 300 in the region, with about 1, 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zika’s potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3. 5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study. So, Dr. Sedgh said, “The increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world. ” The numbers could be “an early warning sign” of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web “might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued. ” Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6. 5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750, 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Women’s rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year. It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. “Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking,” said Dr. Abigail R. A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. “The fear and desperation was really hard to read. ” A woman from Venezuela wrote, “I contracted Zika 4 days ago,” adding: “I love children. But I don’t believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I don’t know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP!” An email from a woman in Colombia said, “Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it. ” She added: “I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick? !” Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws, the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries. In the face of Zika, some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception. Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves, which was founded in 1999 by Dr. Rebecca Gomperts. Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that outlawed abortion, took women on board and performed abortions outside a nation’s territorial waters. As internet access in poor countries increased, Dr. Gomperts began supplying mifepristone and misoprostol pills, a combination approved by the World Health Organization for abortion in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy. The Women on Web site is posted in five languages and tops Google search results for “I need an abortion. ”",0,822,21.63157894736842,38,0.31143552311435524,0,0,0,0,97.84100932048275,26.062692619626937,68.23044838373306,8.391765510948906,0.8394160583941606,0.010948905109489052,0.0267639902676399,0.029197080291970802,0.031630170316301706,0.00851581508515815,0.1411192214111922,0,0.004866180048661801,0.0072992700729927005,0.09367396593673966,0,0.06082725060827251,0.06082725060827251,0.004866180048661801,0.02068126520681265,0.0012165450121654502,0.07420924574209246,0.0036496350364963502,0.052311435523114354,0.012165450121654502,0.0413625304136253,0,0,0.014598540145985401,0.014598540145985401,0.07664233576642336,0.0024330900243309003,0.004866180048661801,0.0024330900243309003,0.025547445255474453,0,0.0072992700729927005,0.045012165450121655,0,0,0.4440389294403893,0.05474452554744526,0.009732360097323601,0,0.010948905109489052,0.0364963503649635,0.0036496350364963502,0.00851581508515815,0.010948905109489052,0.014598540145985401,0,0,0.0036496350364963502,0.019464720194647202,0.0072992700729927005,0.023114355231143552,0.0036496350364963502,0,0.030413625304136254,0.19829683698296838,0,0,0.015815085158150853,0.049878345498783457,0.046228710462287104,0.01824817518248175,0.00851581508515815,0.046228710462287104,0.17396593673965938,0.05474452554744526,0.021897810218978103,0.0012165450121654502,0.024330900243309004,0.15085158150851583,0,0.010948905109489052,0.009732360097323601,0.004866180048661801,0.0024330900243309003,0,0.024330900243309004,0.0012165450121654502,0.07907542579075426,0.09124087591240876,0,0.01824817518248175,0.004866180048661801,0.0413625304136253,0.10583941605839416,0.10948905109489052,0,0.043795620437956206,0.0012165450121654502,9,0,43.73,2.73,4,0,9.73,20,4,87.085,9.73,2,9,0,9,4,36.730000000000004,13.73,141.545,179.27499999999998,36.730000000000004,,0.24611616721299556,0,0.6133403489123389,0.09010466745059892,0.12671020163537874,0,0.26087121464866786,0.420449861343358,0.12671020163537874,0.7595520914454555,0.26087121464866786,0.06764046958777896,0.24611616721299556,0,0.5963562893901542,0.12671020163537874,0.038692686523926156,0.014463669642622001,0.14910853019409548,0.18885465223460007,-0.8431838950541798,0.8111453477653999,52
25,"Email In an historic move the United Nations First Committee voted Thursday to convene a conference next March to negotiate a new treaty to ban the possession of nuclear weapons. The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. Dismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the US, Russia, UK, China and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, or P5. Further meetings in Nayarit, Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to “close the gap” in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday. The United States, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the “Yes” vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. The final vote was 123 For, 38 Against and 16 Abstentions. The “No” votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and US allies in NATO, plus Japan, South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the “US nuclear umbrella”. But four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with China, India and Pakistan abstaining, and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. In addition, the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained, as did Finland, which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance. Japan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in March. The US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall, but, following Thursday’s vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March, and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. The successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. We have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. This will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. If we don’t get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. The decision is ours.

26,"JERUSALEM  —   Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated last night’s deadly terrorist massacre at a crowded concert in Manchester, England, with the jihadists vowing to continue the onslaught against the West. [The Islamic State claimed that a “soldier of the caliphate planted bombs in the middle of Crusaders gatherings,” apparently taking credit for the carnage.  Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The chat group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and it has been used in the past to issue IS communications. A militant named Abu Ayman Alalmani (the German) wrote, “Thanks to Allah who allowed this achievement of the Mujahedeen. We are all believers in Allah that our brothers, the supporters and the Mujahedeen, are those who committed the attack among the infidels. We swear to Allah that the infidel countries in the West won’t have the luxury of security. This is a Godly promise and this is the promise of the Mujahedeen, the future will prove to you that you are the countries of heresy. You will see this and not only hear it. ” An account titled “Muslim Justice” wrote, “Allah is great, Allah is great, we will shake the infidel and criminal regimes. We will destroy the rule of those who abandon Islam [a reference to Arab leaders]. Allah is great, this is a call that will rise high on the horizon and we will yet defeat the cross and the countries of infidels. ” ISIS member Abu Abdullah Alsury (the Syrian) wrote, “Thanks to Allah who caused the faithful to rejoice, we ask and request of Allah that this blessed act will be part of the battle of our brothers, the lone wolves roaming across all parts of the infidel nations, as they seek this type of blessed attack. This is part of the work and this is part of the revenge. Those infidel states will pay a heavy price. ” Prior to the Islamic State claiming credit for the attack, another militant, Alqaqaa Alidlebi from Idlib, wrote, “We’re waiting for our brothers in the official media department to publish what should warm our hearts with an official declaration of responsibility, even if this isn’t an organized act. ” “We pray to Allah that the attacker is a faithful Muslim. You aren’t aware of the huge happiness here in the ranks of the Mujahedeen and their families in the district of Elkheir (the area of Dir Azzur on the border between Syria and Iraq). How happy we are that Allah guided the hand of the attacker to send the heads of the corrupt infidels who murder the Muslims in our countries flying. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

27,"Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton outside rally (left), Fox News catching incident on live feed (right) Both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of Florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations. However, things didn’t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign — which backfired big time. While Donald Trump’s 15,000-person army of “Deplorables” were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she’s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary’s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. Perhaps Hillary didn’t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching — and commenting — live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. “Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There’s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,” one host pointed out much to Hillary’s embarrassment. “The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there’s empty space here and she’s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,” the commentators added. No matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. On the other hand, there are Trump’s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary’s that these massive stadiums can’t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what’s expected at the polls, Hillary can’t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen",1,469,29.3125,16,0.2878464818763326,0,0,0,0,78.70146566089123,20.201255626628758,71.0457000710732,58.03378710841397,0.7974413646055437,0.014925373134328358,0.053304904051172705,0.057569296375266525,0.046908315565031986,0.006396588486140725,0.14925373134328357,0.010660980810234541,0.006396588486140725,0.029850746268656716,0.057569296375266525,0.0021321961620469083,0.08742004264392324,0.010660980810234541,0.0042643923240938165,0.01279317697228145,0.008528784648187633,0.09594882729211088,0,0.057569296375266525,0.02771855010660981,0.06396588486140725,0.0042643923240938165,0,0.031982942430703626,0.019189765458422176,0.08742004264392324,0,0,0.0042643923240938165,0.0255863539445629,0,0.006396588486140725,0.057569296375266525,0,0,0.488272921108742,0.0042643923240938165,0.008528784648187633,0.0021321961620469083,0.0021321961620469083,0.05543710021321962,0.0042643923240938165,0.0021321961620469083,0.010660980810234541,0.029850746268656716,0.0042643923240938165,0.0042643923240938165,0.0021321961620469083,0.01279317697228145,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,0,0.0021321961620469083,0.031982942430703626,0.2921108742004264,0.006396588486140725,0.0042643923240938165,0.0255863539445629,0.03411513859275053,0.017057569296375266,0.03837953091684435,0.031982942430703626,0.046908315565031986,0.16204690831556504,0.09381663113006397,0.021321961620469083,0,0.01279317697228145,0.15991471215351813,0,0.019189765458422176,0.006396588486140725,0.0021321961620469083,0.01279317697228145,0,0,0.0255863539445629,0.09594882729211088,0.10874200426439233,0,0.029850746268656716,0.0021321961620469083,0.03837953091684435,0.16204690831556504,0.15991471215351813,0.0042643923240938165,0.010660980810234541,0.0042643923240938165,17.75,3,7,2,1,2,0,5,17,4,7.75,1,16,0,17.75,0,45.75,4,55.5,103.25,45.75,,0.49805626429774924,0.14361939376204164,0.28125389940955065,0.10056040392403998,0.05294214363635836,0.10056040392403998,0,0.21844989525420877,0.487265965805529,0.1827439976315568,0.30227925791771854,0.05294214363635836,0.4721359549995794,0,0.2511664187323588,0,0.08452655889145497,0.007390300230946882,0.10254041570438799,0.1907621247113164,-0.4352851395043972,0.8092378752886836,31
28,"Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox News host, charged in a lawsuit filed Monday that top executives at the network, including the man who replaced Roger Ailes, punished her for complaining about sexual harassment by Mr. Ailes. The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. “Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a   Playboy   cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,” Ms. Tantaros’s suit says. Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Ailes, the network’s founding chairman and guiding force for two decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr. Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment. In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her. During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum “in the seven figures” if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and others at the network, including the host Bill O’Reilly. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr. O’Reilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser. “Ailes did not act alone,” the lawsuit states. “He may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation. ” Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as “sock puppets” that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department. Ms. Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010, and a year later was named   of “The Five,” which aired at 5 p. m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because “Roger wants to see your legs. ” The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children. “Ailes then started complaining about marriage in general, and also made   jokes about being married,” the lawsuit states. It describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities. He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around “so I can get a good look at you,” the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she was moved from “The Five” to a   show, “Outnumbered,” that aired at midday. Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department. In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with. In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with Bill Shine, then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine “told Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we can’t control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain. ” Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that “this powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti” and that Ms. Tantaros “needs to let this one go. ” Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her. Mr. Shine was named   of Fox News after Mr. Ailes departed.",0,759,23.71875,32,0.2964426877470356,0,0,0,0,93.25858951175407,1.2047359787129601,93.49558879938627,7.499805155040917,0.7707509881422925,0.011857707509881422,0.028985507246376812,0.022397891963109356,0.034255599472990776,0.014492753623188406,0.2002635046113307,0.013175230566534914,0.003952569169960474,0.006587615283267457,0.08695652173913043,0,0.048748353096179184,0.011857707509881422,0.005270092226613966,0.011857707509881422,0.002635046113306983,0.0461133069828722,0,0.07509881422924901,0.023715415019762844,0.05138339920948617,0,0,0.017127799736495388,0.013175230566534914,0.11857707509881422,0,0.005270092226613966,0.0013175230566534915,0.05928853754940711,0,0.00922266139657444,0.08036890645586298,0.0013175230566534915,0.0013175230566534915,0.4440052700922266,0.0013175230566534915,0.022397891963109356,0.0013175230566534915,0.0013175230566534915,0.04216073781291173,0.003952569169960474,0,0.003952569169960474,0.010540184453227932,0.010540184453227932,0.04216073781291173,0.005270092226613966,0.017127799736495388,0.007905138339920948,0.025032938076416336,0.003952569169960474,0,0.017127799736495388,0.18181818181818182,0,0,0.03689064558629776,0.08168642951251646,0.06455862977602109,0.06324110671936758,0.00922266139657444,0.08563899868247694,0.14888010540184454,0.10540184453227931,0.003952569169960474,0,0.03689064558629776,0.1225296442687747,0.0013175230566534915,0.010540184453227932,0.003952569169960474,0.003952569169960474,0.014492753623188406,0,0.006587615283267457,0.057971014492753624,0.17391304347826086,0.05401844532279315,0,0.00922266139657444,0,0.05401844532279315,0.1225296442687747,0.11989459815546773,0.0013175230566534915,0.05138339920948617,0.002635046113306983,10,3,124,6,0,0,4,12,6,48,2,0,19.675,0,10,0,36.675,4,174,209.675,36.675,,0.28330039409901914,0.10601373033920936,0.8305524267856249,0.19170418491404337,0,0,0.1365270594958143,0.3217311600325895,0.19170418491404337,0.6548590014996047,0.07326484679668878,0,0.4374825604978478,0,0.3217311600325895,0,0.0404499958640086,0.004411724156947087,0.19191000082719828,0.23125706565197013,-0.8847488216573179,0.7687429343480299,62
29,"During a discussion of BuzzFeed’s story on a dossier regarding Russia and   Donald Trump on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” host Chuck Todd told BuzzFeed    Ben Smith “you just published fake news. ”  Todd said BuzzFeed’s decision to publish the dossier was an instance where they “would not have made the same decision in the   era. ” Smith stated that it was more “the   era. ” And that there was a time “where we could act as gatekeepers. Where we could say, you know what, crazy people are claiming that Barack Obama’s birth certificate is forged, but we’re not going to write about that, that’s crazy. ” He continued that this era doesn’t exist, and that while they had reporters trying to confirm or deny specific details, the dossier was “in play,” and “having consequences for the way our elected leaders are acting. The  —   you do have to ask the question of, why should I suppress that? There are then good reasons, right? Once though, it emerges, as it did last night in the public conversation that there is this secret document floating around, full of dark allegations that we will not repeat to you. That I feel like in this era, you really have to share [with] your readers what that is in an appropriate context. And our original report, I mean, if you read what we wrote, it stressed that there were real solid reasons to distrust this. It noted two specific errors. ” Todd then asked if BuzzFeed had a responsibility to not spread false information. Smith responded that, like with the Obama birth certificate issue, it’s a “difficult balance that everybody in our business navigates every day. ” Todd then asked if BuzzFeed would publish a false birth certificate. Smith answered, “We certainly quoted the   of the United States making false claims about it, and years ago we debated whether we should quote regular citizens in Iowa saying, I don’t believe his birth certificate. And I remember us thinking at first, we probably shouldn’t. That we we shouldn’t pass that on and then saying, you know what, this has become a force that is impacting the conversation. ” Todd countered, “I know this was not your intent. I’ve known you a long time, but you just published fake news. ” Smith countered that people throw the term “fake news” around to diminish things they don’t like, and that “this was a real story about a real document that was really being passed around between the very top officials of this country. And then the question you say is, okay, it’s okay for you  —   to Chuck Todd see this document. It’s okay for me to see it. Okay for Senator John McCain ( ). Okay for the CIA. What’s  —   why is it not okay for your audience?” Todd then countered that BuzzFeed could have published a redacted version of the document. Smith answered that there was fair disagreement, but didn’t think you could defend acknowledging the dossier’s existence but then not say what was in it and that this was saying it was okay to summarize false claims. Smith further stated that if there wasn’t a “public conversation” about the dossier, they would have just continued to report the story out.

30,"Country: Israel While China is silently playing an important role in the mitigation of the conflict in the Middle East, which is an important market for the Chinese goods, continuously deteriorating security situation, marred by the presence of numerous jihadi groups in the region, the necessity for China to have a strong anchor in the region has become all the more evident today than it was few years ago. The so-called “Arab spring” has brought many changes in its wake. However, war being one of the most important outcomes of this “spring”, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. To this particular outcome owes the growth of China-Israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year. Facts speak for themselves: China’s total capital investment in Israeli high-tech deals involving Chinese businesses is expected to reach around $500 million by the end of 2016, compared to $467 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2012. And as Times of Israel reported recently, Chinese acquisitions in Israel have dramatically increased in the last few years. In March 2015, China’s Bright Food acquired Tnuva , one of Israel’s largest dairy companies for approximately $2.1 billion. Similarly, in July 2016, a Chinese consortium that included private equity firm Yunfeng Capital — founded by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma – acquired Israeli social games company Playtika from Caesars Interactive Entertainment online games unit for $4.4 billion in cash. In August 2016, ChemChina completed its takeover of Adama — considered one of the world’s leading crop protection companies — for approximately $1.4 billion. The high level of growth is—and it is not a coincidence—running parallel to the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict in the Mid-East region, particularly in and around the Suez canal region. While Syria and Iraq are direct victims of terrorism, many important countries such as Egypt (read: Egypt’s Sisi is building ties with Syria because of the fears of being the next target of jihadist militias) are only inches away from breaking down into shatters, pushing China to find an alternative route and construct an alternative geography of trade to steer its own business in the region. Israel, as such, happens to be the best country in the region. Not only is it politically and militarily stable, but its geographical location also makes it an apt candidate to qualify for partnership in China’s ‘Silk Road’ on its southern corridor, which is China’s route to Europe. Before the emergence of ‘jihadi’ groups in the Middle East, China depended on the Suez Canal to reach its largest export destination: Europe. With its trade volume standing roughly at €521 billion in 2015, and the volume of their bi-lateral trade crossing well over €1 billion a day , Europe undoubtedly remains one of the most important markets for the Chinese business, and with it remains the Mid-East the only geographical entity to facilitate this trade. However, the presence of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist groups in the Sinai are threatening China’s maritime trade. With over 95% of global trade being seaborne and China now as the world’s largest trading state, this is a serious challenge for Beijing’s continued economic development. The crisis in the Middle East is, therefore, directly threatening China’s economic interest. And, while China has already stepped in the crisis (read: China’s Rear Adm Guan Youfei recently visited Syria to boost co-operation with the Syrian army), this is not the only way it is following to protect its vital interests. This is where Israel becomes important for China. The growing economic alliance between Israel and China is moving forward with a $2 billion, 300 kilometre freight rail link connecting Eilat, on the Red Sea, with Ashdod Port, on the Mediterranean. The project, nicknamed the ‘Red-Med,’ was greenlit by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet, and construction, which is expected to take five years, will begin within the year. About the link, Netanyahu said, “It’s the first time we’d be able to assist the countries in Europe and Asia to make sure they always have an open connection between Europe and Asia and between Asia and Europe.” While Israel is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in providing an unhindered and a secure trade route for European and Asia countries, China’s primary motivation is not to merely to build a network of allies in the Middle East. For China, the primary concern remains, apart from its trade with the Mid-Eastern countries, access to Europe and the African continent via the Middle East. However, both of these concerns cannot be effectively satisfied when the entire region remains under crisis. China, due to its fairly balanced approach to the crisis and the fact that it is perhaps the only global player that continues to enjoy equally good relations with such arch rivals as, for instance, Israel and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran, is an important country for the regional countries to look up to as a conflict mediator. This assumption about China playing this role owes its existence to the geography of trade China is eyeing to build through the Mid-East. As an alternative to shipping through the crowded Suez Canal, China sees value in sending goods into the Persian Gulf, and shipping them overland to the Mediterranean via several lines that could cross through Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or even southern Iraq before finally continuing through Jordan and Israel. Will China eventually built this geography or not is a moot question. However, it is quite obvious that regional countries are open to it and know the potential benefits it can yield. Speaking at to the inaugural SIGNAL conference on Israel’s China policy at the IDC in Herzliya in the last week of September, Capt. Yigal Maor, director general of the Israel’s Transportation Ministry’s Administration of Shipping and Ports, said that If China invests in building those paths, which he dubbed IGEC – the Israel Gulf Economic Corridor – it could push Gulf countries into more formal ties with Israel. “Maybe with the help of China there will be peace in that area,” he said. Whereas such prospects signal Israel’s own elevation from the position of a US “protected” state to an important power, integrating the region, as also continents, the potential entry of the “dragon” in the region, connecting various countries into a whole, is likely to yield important results for the whole region. While we may have to wait a little to see what impact it leaves exactly, it is quite obvious that China is poised to become an important player in the Mideast security scene, and is already asserting its role economically, diplomatically and, to some extent, militarily.

31,"LONDON  —   With their giddy celebrations of “independence day” having given way to political and economic turmoil, one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union: They had no plan for what comes next. In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movement’s leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent. The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or “Brexit. ” But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign. On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service, the “Leave” coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims. Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, and benefited the broader Leave campaign, whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives, Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice minister. In changing their tune, the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union  —   which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week  —   would be available to help finance the National Health Service. For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the £350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, “the lion’s share” of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services. On immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, “Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed. ” Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U. K. Independence Party eager to build support. “There is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,” said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. “If they don’t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010. ” In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue. “It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I do not believe that is so. ” Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, “British people will still be able to go and work in the E. U. to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down. ” Not only that, he asserted, “There will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market. ” What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in  . But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member. “The difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality,” Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. “And reality, particularly where the E. U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing. ” Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials. But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. “I worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,” he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right. The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, “Remain,” against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U. K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. “There was no coherence, because it wasn’t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,” he said. Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said. “And now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a   government that must reflect the schism in itself,” he said. In the aftermath of the Leave campaign’s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp’s plan. The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: “There is no plan. The Leave campaign don’t have a   plan. ” Then the legislator added, “Number 10 should have had a plan,” referring to the prime minister’s office.",0,1272,24.941176470588236,51,0.3278301886792453,0,0,0,0,93.61399797559339,13.232522103728005,70.36521361960529,38.33744557329463,0.8238993710691824,0.026729559748427674,0.03930817610062893,0.03223270440251572,0.03773584905660377,0.020440251572327043,0.1619496855345912,0.003930817610062893,0.003930817610062893,0.006289308176100629,0.09905660377358491,0.0023584905660377358,0.06682389937106918,0.007075471698113208,0.0007861635220125787,0.02279874213836478,0.01179245283018868,0.10927672955974843,0.0015723270440251573,0.06839622641509434,0.015723270440251572,0.05817610062893082,0,0,0.027515723270440252,0.0220125786163522,0.1029874213836478,0,0,0.003930817610062893,0,0,0.018081761006289308,0.05188679245283019,0,0,0.4882075471698113,0.00550314465408805,0.010220125786163521,0.0007861635220125787,0.0015723270440251573,0.0479559748427673,0.007075471698113208,0.0007861635220125787,0.018867924528301886,0.019654088050314465,0.0110062893081761,0.02358490566037736,0.015723270440251572,0.03459119496855346,0.01179245283018868,0.014937106918238994,0.007075471698113208,0,0.012578616352201259,0.21933962264150944,0.003930817610062893,0,0.02122641509433962,0.05188679245283019,0.07861635220125786,0.0330188679245283,0.0220125786163522,0.05817610062893082,0.15487421383647798,0.0809748427672956,0.014150943396226415,0,0.029874213836477988,0.12971698113207547,0.0047169811320754715,0.009433962264150943,0.006289308176100629,0.0023584905660377358,0.006289308176100629,0,0,0.012578616352201259,0.08962264150943396,0.06289308176100629,0,0.0220125786163522,0.014150943396226415,0.0330188679245283,0.14072327044025157,0.13679245283018868,0,0.05817610062893082,0.0047169811320754715,13.975,0,64.225,8,0,6,34.75,31,20,76.3,32.6,31,40.5,0,13.975,6,124.075,50.75,174.025,340.35,124.075,,0.30438374330484147,0,0.667880315549116,0.20031329577692572,0,0.15815511491062575,0.521087638117128,0.492552613654599,0.3850786724304072,0.7049316836572869,0.5051331534572138,0.492552613654599,0.5591031467369991,0,0.508181421792658,0.15815511491062575,0.08209547755318093,0.03357925033910081,0.11514539980811858,0.2251960168061667,-0.688650356820932,0.7748039831938334,101
32,"MIDLAND, Tex.  —   In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers, Eustasio Velazquez’s career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. “I don’t see a future,” Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. “Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot. ” Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs  —   just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for   workers  —   sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center  —   but their numbers don’t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education. Roughly 163, 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive   state, totaled 98, 000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. “People have left the industry, and they are not coming back,” said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. “If it’s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I don’t need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that. ” Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time  —   onshore or miles out to sea  —   and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8. 6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels. Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business. All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees. The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. “We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people,” said Joey Hall, Pioneer’s executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. “We’re heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms,” Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. “Through repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions. ” With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations. GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production. Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago. “With the adoption of all this   software and stuff, we’ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians,” said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. “I’m lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science,” he said. But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100, 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S. O. C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. “It’s a struggle,” said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S. O. C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations. “A lot of the guys can’t operate these new technologies, tablets and instruments, and they keep whining,” he added. “They want to know why we can’t do things like we used to. ” Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers, and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers. That’s a good thing for Michael Manga, 34, an employee of Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active here. A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. “We do such a good job now,” he said, “we’re drilling ourselves out of a job. ”",0,1633,21.773333333333333,75,0.3104715248009798,0,0,0,0,95.95047726886338,21.612934212264207,62.95110113175024,38.862381647746005,0.8064911206368647,0.02878138395590937,0.04837721984078383,0.03368034292712799,0.03061849357011635,0.01224739742804654,0.14206981016533987,0,0.003674219228413962,0.008573178199632579,0.08328230251071647,0.000612369871402327,0.05021432945499082,0.014084507042253521,0.003674219228413962,0.021432945499081445,0.009797917942437232,0.07532149418248622,0,0.06368646662584201,0.029393753827311696,0.05695039804041641,0,0,0.017758726270667484,0.00612369871402327,0.08879363135333741,0,0.000612369871402327,0.004898958971218616,0,0,0.005511328842620943,0.02878138395590937,0.001224739742804654,0.001224739742804654,0.4255970606246173,0.007960808328230252,0.007960808328230252,0.001224739742804654,0.003061849357011635,0.026331904470300063,0.006736068585425597,0.003061849357011635,0.011022657685241886,0.007348438456827924,0.004898958971218616,0.012859767299448868,0.011022657685241886,0.01837109614206981,0.007348438456827924,0.011635027556644213,0.001837109614206981,0.004286589099816289,0.03551745254133497,0.21494182486221677,0.00612369871402327,0,0.03306797305572566,0.04654011022657685,0.10287813839559094,0.03061849357011635,0.018983466013472138,0.04592774035517452,0.15676668707899571,0.05695039804041641,0.03490508266993264,0,0.017146356399265157,0.14819350887936314,0,0.011022657685241886,0.005511328842620943,0.005511328842620943,0.005511328842620943,0,0,0.011022657685241886,0.05327617881200245,0.07960808328230251,0,0.015309246785058175,0.008573178199632579,0.054500918554807105,0.10838946723821188,0.09552969993876301,0.006736068585425597,0.08940600122473974,0.001224739742804654,74.72500000000001,0,34.625,24,7,15.75,8,3,19.455,37,37.45,30.875,10,4,74.72500000000001,4,169.05499999999998,31.75,129.625,327.43,169.05499999999998,,0.6586321421464972,0,0.4720207021927434,0.3825930769369914,0.15307293882461695,0.2890978000320848,0.17119684379985609,0.0718910130021613,0.3343654839655267,0.4885789167690401,0.4915999195330919,0.44357551716322935,0.20521309615767264,0.09361141094898698,0.5080666151703325,0.09361141094898698,0.09081996099772754,0.01705677892802845,0.06963732184395867,0.17590239761903484,0.5901269836170906,0.8240976023809652,99
33,"Don Halcomb, a    farmer in Adairville, Ky. is expecting his profit to vanish this year, largely because of the confluence of falling crop prices and rising costs for seeds and other materials. The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to $300 from $80 in the last decade, as the companies that produced them consolidated, he said. And with the recent decline in commodity prices, Mr. Halcomb said he expects to lose $100 an acre this year. “We’re producing our crops at a loss now, just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss,” Mr. Halcomb, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat and barley on his   family farm, said by telephone on Wednesday. “You can’t cut your costs fast enough. ” It is a common plight of farmers across the United States, with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn. Because farmers have produced too much corn, wheat and soybeans, they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops. They have also reduced spending on seeds, pesticides and fertilizer, which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants, including Monsanto and DuPont. In response, these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industry’s storm. Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year. The latest is Bayer AG’s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto  —   the largest acquisition of 2016  —   announced on Wednesday. Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers. Mr. Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St. Louis and seeds from DuPont, which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical. His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary, Alberta, which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland, which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation. “It’s just like any other industry that consolidates,” Mr. Halcomb said. “They tell the regulators they’re   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the deal’s done. ” The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities, but these deals, given their size and scope, have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington. There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval, and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns. Dow’s merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review. The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday. Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the $128 per share cash offer from Bayer, which is based in Leverkusen, Germany. Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced. Adding the assumption of about $10 billion of Monsanto debt, Bayer’s total $66 billion pact is the largest   deal, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, ahead of InBev’s $60. 4 billion offer for another St.   company,   in June 2008. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming. Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state, according to the National Corn Growers Association. “It seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many,” Senator Grassley said in a phone interview. “When you have less competition, prices go up. ” European competition regulators also said publicly, before a   deal was even signed, that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products, as well as research. Liam Condon, who leads Bayer’s   division, said in an interview that the company did an “extensive analysis” with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May. Mr. Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios, because Bayer’s focus is largely on crop protection, while Monsanto’s is on seeds and traits. He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators. Monsanto, which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds, rejected several offers from Bayer as too low. Wednesday’s deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsanto’s stock price on May 9, the day before Bayer’s interest in a deal surfaced. To assuage Monsanto’s concerns, Bayer threw in a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds. The strategic goal of the deal, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, is to create a    experience for farmers, making Bayer the world’s largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals. By improving the product for farmers, the combined company could ultimately raise prices, Mr. Selesky said in an interview. Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them. Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about $1. 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal, helping to improve efficiency. But Jim Benham of Versailles, Ind. the president of the Indiana Farmers Union, was not so optimistic. He blamed the rising costs of inputs  —   seeds, fertilizer and the like  —   for eating away at farmers’ profit margins, and warned that consolidation will make it worse. Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years, and the proposed   merger could accelerate that. “The merger is going to hurt the farmer,” said Mr. Benham, who grows corn, soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm. “The more consolidation we have on our inputs, the worse it gets. ” Mr. Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers. “This is a highly competitive industry, and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers won’t go anywhere,” he said. “It’s up to us to show what we’re offering will help farmers improve their return on investment. ” Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall. Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12, 000 acres in Kimball, S. D. growing crops like corn and operating a ranch. She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening, then maybe it could actually help farmers. “I understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive,” she said. “As we are in a low part of the cycle, anything that might have a chance of reducing our input prices would be great. ”",0,1122,18.096774193548388,62,0.33511586452762926,0,0,0,0,94.26876609229551,7.155724603114827,78.62430533710811,31.86618283677107,0.767379679144385,0.020499108734402853,0.036541889483065956,0.025846702317290554,0.035650623885918005,0.015151515151515152,0.18181818181818182,0.0035650623885918,0,0.0196078431372549,0.07397504456327986,0,0.06060606060606061,0.0053475935828877,0,0.025846702317290554,0.004456327985739751,0.0855614973262032,0,0.06506238859180036,0.031194295900178252,0.049910873440285206,0,0,0.017825311942959002,0.013368983957219251,0.0855614973262032,0,0.00089126559714795,0.0017825311942959,0.0017825311942959,0,0.015151515151515152,0.035650623885918005,0.00089126559714795,0.00089126559714795,0.43137254901960786,0.00089126559714795,0.020499108734402853,0.00089126559714795,0.00089126559714795,0.03832442067736185,0.00089126559714795,0.004456327985739751,0.0106951871657754,0.012477718360071301,0.00089126559714795,0.01871657754010695,0.0338680926916221,0.0196078431372549,0.0071301247771836,0.016042780748663103,0,0.00089126559714795,0.026737967914438502,0.21390374331550802,0.012477718360071301,0,0.027629233511586453,0.06149732620320856,0.0944741532976827,0.03832442067736185,0.0196078431372549,0.04367201426024955,0.15775401069518716,0.0766488413547237,0.025846702317290554,0,0.023172905525846704,0.11853832442067737,0,0.011586452762923352,0.006238859180035651,0.0071301247771836,0.00267379679144385,0,0,0.012477718360071301,0.09536541889483066,0.06149732620320856,0,0.022281639928698752,0.015151515151515152,0.0392156862745098,0.1140819964349376,0.11586452762923351,0.0071301247771836,0.06506238859180036,0.00267379679144385,36,0,24,0,0,11,9,14,10.3,32.25,21.625,0,13,8,36,1,75.925,20,99.25,183.925,75.925,,0.5055211778669881,0,0.40531206228860306,0,0,0.2380249963865042,0.20355712123370334,0.28447401544679335,0.226305815585166,0.4780353239237566,0.3804630509816135,0,0.2696332758199199,0.18512676002257156,0.49123269753348353,0.027613909381209053,0.06128296708840325,0.016143027221179652,0.08010977258510403,0.14845531408277338,-0.4836723094524692,0.8515446859172267,67
34,"VOROKHOBINO, Russia  —   A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun, Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist when he tried to change some money and the teller “suddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear. ” His name had popped up on the exchange bureau’s computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence. The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction “Thou shalt not kill. ” Yet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovah’s Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K. G. B. the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putin’s efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values. The Justice Ministry, in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month, put the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia, an office complex near St. Petersburg, on a list of the bodies banned “in connection with the carrying out of extremist activities. ” Whether it stays there will depend on Russia’s Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170, 000 Russian members from spreading “extremist” texts. Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities. Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law. In the case of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the group’s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria. Jehovah’s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovah’s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russia’s   version of the K. G. B. the Federal Security Service, or F. S. B. “I have absolutely no interest in politics,” he said during a recent Jehovah’s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a   village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president. “From the Russian state’s perspective, Jehovah’s Witnesses are completely separate,” said Geraldine Fagan, the author of “Believing in Russia  —   Religious Policy After Communism. ” She added, “They don’t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation. ” “The idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of  —   and also indifferent to  —   the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,” she said. That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, “all adds up to a big conspiracy theory” for the increasingly assertive F. S. B. For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010. Accused of “inciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens,” he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutor’s case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovah’s Witnesses. “Their disregard for the state,” a report prepared for the prosecution said, “erodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security. ” In a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over  —   until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of “terrorists and extremists. ” He and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. “There is a big wave of repression breaking,” Mr. Stepanov said. In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovah’s Witnesses “administrative center” near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be “liquidated,” along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures. For the denomination’s leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era. Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. “It is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate,” he said. “Never did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia. ” In Russia, as in many countries, the    proselytizing of Jehovah’s Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance. “I cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat,” said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, which monitors extremism in Russia. “But they are seen as a good target. They are pacifists, so they cannot be radicalized, no matter what you do to them. They can be used to send a message. ” That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program  —   or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlin’s drive to make Russia a great power again. “A big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target,” Ms. Fagan said. “They don’t vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them. ” Attacking Jehovah’s Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the   law, which was passed after Russia’s second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited “incitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence. ” But the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation. Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan “Orthodoxy or Death!”  —   a rallying cry embraced by some   believers  —   has been banned as an illegal extremist text. To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith. The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as “part of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations” that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovah’s Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States. “They are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services,” he said. “They don’t like having an organization that they do not and cannot control. ” Artyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovah’s Witness who used to work at the group’s Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had “many positive elements,” like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits. All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. “Look at it from the view of the state,” he said. “Here is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members don’t serve in the army and don’t vote. ” Estranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovah’s Witnesses broke up families and “in the logic of the state, it presents a threat. ” He added, “I am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts. ” Mr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith. “They say I am a terrorist,” he said, “but all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible. ”",0,1773,23.025974025974026,77,0.3513818386914834,0,0,0,0,94.37875898620399,11.216614603670441,68.81049069373942,14.158821719735428,0.7913141567963903,0.015228426395939087,0.04117315284827975,0.0338409475465313,0.046813310772701636,0.023124647490129723,0.1799210377890581,0.011844331641285956,0.009588268471517203,0.019176536943034405,0.10039481105470953,0.001692047377326565,0.05583756345177665,0.0056401579244218835,0.00338409475465313,0.012972363226170333,0.01410039481105471,0.08855047941342357,0.0005640157924421884,0.06824591088550479,0.023124647490129723,0.05922165820642978,0,0.0022560631697687537,0.02763677382966723,0.00676818950930626,0.10885504794134236,0.0005640157924421884,0.0028200789622109417,0.0005640157924421884,0.0022560631697687537,0,0.003948110547095319,0.04512126339537507,0,0,0.47377326565143824,0.0011280315848843769,0.015792442188381276,0.0022560631697687537,0.0045121263395375075,0.04117315284827975,0.0045121263395375075,0.0011280315848843769,0.01692047377326565,0.01015228426395939,0.0056401579244218835,0.024252679075014102,0.003948110547095319,0.01353637901861252,0.014664410603496898,0.02763677382966723,0.00338409475465313,0.0005640157924421884,0.01071630005640158,0.18781725888324874,0.0045121263395375075,0,0.024252679075014102,0.047377326565143825,0.07896221094190638,0.03948110547095319,0.019176536943034405,0.06204173716864072,0.15679639029892836,0.08065425831923294,0.021996615905245348,0,0.03948110547095319,0.11505922165820642,0.02707275803722504,0.012972363226170333,0.009024252679075015,0.0028200789622109417,0.007332205301748449,0,0,0.02030456852791878,0.09362662154540327,0.06486181613085167,0,0.019740552735476594,0.012408347433728144,0.03722504230118443,0.10772701635645798,0.10434292160180485,0.0011280315848843769,0.04060913705583756,0.0011280315848843769,32,0,245.80499999999998,4,27.5,6,16,62,15.7,193.12999999999997,38,19.875,51.4,0,32,16,166.6,38,417.43500000000006,606.035,166.6,,0.44916798391920415,0,0.8623289529139322,0.09250087595983508,0.4120292540595497,0.13261768779533445,0.28963032698688057,0.6123890226027672,0.28575155176917494,0.8311212498080223,0.4919550223592953,0.33619296821963723,0.5670608241026586,0,0.6079747967739814,0.28963032698688057,0.0746404066244481,0.017024822639429938,0.18701991680237992,0.2715167996917611,-0.9003931079447107,0.7284832003082389,147
35,"Why We Are Still In ‘The Danger Zone’ Until January 20th, 2017   17th, 2016 Donald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as “the danger zone”, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trump’s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. And the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets. On Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected. Throughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been “faithless electors” before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election. One petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled “ Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? “… A Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” and that “Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.” “If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,” the petition states. “However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Personally, I don’t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome. However, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. If Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place. But if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate – including Hillary Clinton. If everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history. In an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible. This giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#DisruptJ20″ is being widely used all over social media. Traditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. Let us hope that they are not successful. Another reason why we will be in “the danger zone” over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations. Now that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. And this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama “against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office” … Saying that pushing agendas “contrary to the president-elect’s position” would not be in the “spirit of the transition”, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office. “On big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I don’t think it’s in keeping with the spirit of the transition…to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect’s positions,” the advisor told Politico . Specifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a “two state solution”, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state. Just a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled “ Obama’s Israel Surprise? ” reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo. The rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann … The Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesday’s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama “may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.” The president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. He may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported. If Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. But if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians. When politicians are going to do something that they know people won’t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren’t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 . So keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. My hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful. And as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. Could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? Or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? I believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions. “Danger Zone” Brings back memories of Kenny Loggins and Top Gun. anonymous Listen to her howlin’ roar Metal under tension Beggin’ you to touch and go Highway to the Danger Zone Ride into the Danger Zone Headin’ into twilight Spreadin’ out her wings tonight She got you jumpin’ off the deck And shovin’ into overdrive Highway to the Danger Zone I’ll take you Right into the Danger Zone William Lutz I will not celebrate the holidays this year!

Mondobeyondo Merry Hallothanksmaskwanzaanewyear! nick I am a political atheist, just to set the record straight. Although I visit this site fairly often, it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear. When George W. as elected, there were many protesters, they were just hidden away in “free speech” zones. Of course there are many unhappy people, as there were in 2000, and every election. Trumps votes were less than 19% of the 325 million people in the country. Will Trump bring jobs. No, not unless they are gov’t employees, or funded by taxes. There is only one way jobs are created, and that is when there is demand for products and services. A lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities, let alone keep playing the consumerism game. I cannot see Obama doing anything that requires legislation, as he is lame duck status now. Perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists, especially lobbyists I have been an expat for over 6 years, it is a lovely peaceful warm day here. Think I will go for a bicycle ride, then a dip in 86 degree seawater. I do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise, even when it is obscured by clouds. Peace and Love…it is the only way df NJ Obama’s big political move will be to appoint an ultra liberal judge to the bench during the recess. I just can’t imagine that he doesn’t leave office without punishing the Republicans for not taking Garland. And given all the threats to taking away all of Obama’s legacy this is the only thing left he has to make his mark on history. Rick I don’t think he can do that with a phone and pen. Sorry. HeyAHuman Could you imagine the pandemonium that would ensue if the Electoral College were to vote Hillary in? Then we’d be in a REAL danger zone… Mondobeyondo Yes, it would be. It would be like the Krakatoa volcano erupting again. df NJ That is not going to happen because the electors hate Hillary as much as you do. It would be like cutting off one of your own fingers with a kitchen knife. I think we are okay. anonymous It always amazes me that people will look for signs in anything.

ISA41:10 Liberals have long since gone beyond Activism, and descended to mobs all acting like spoiled children, stamping their feet and screaming, “I want it NOW!” It’s the politics of juvenile delinquency.

JC Teecher Jesse “james” Jackson, a pawn for the left, is pushing hard to have hitlery pardoned for all her crimes, before she is even charged. As a crook himself, he has received a free pass because of his so called “religious” connections. Bull caca! Occult religions maybe. Mondobeyondo Yes, there is still a possibility that Hillary Clinton could still get in the Oval Office. But a Trump presidency is pretty much a done deal (knock on wood). The Secret Service had better guard him and his family VERY closely. From what I’ve seen and heard, President Obama is trying to make Trump’s transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly (even though they hate each other). Let’s hope that Trump’s presidency will be a successful one, and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country. Back in 1985, I bought a brand new book called “The Art of the Deal” at my college bookstore. It was written by some guy named Donald Trump. Yes, I actually did read it. df NJ Not a chance.

We have way too many problems and debt in this country to continue our foreign policies of American adventurism. Where’s Pat Buchanan when you need him? I think it’s time we return to a more traditional conservative approach to foreign policy. The long war does absolutely nothing to make me feel safer on the streets of Newark or Jersey City. I say eff ’em. America first! TheLulzWarrior Who f***ing cares? Israel is not an US state so far, they would simply refuse to go along such a plan. Paul Patriot Freedom loving Americans (should) know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on December 19th. The left can whine, shout, protest and riot……its time freedom loving Americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyranny……and apathy, passivity, fear and political correctness will prove ineffective. The liberty tree is getting mighty thirsty…..just saying! df NJ There are many forms of freedom. You criticize the left but you just don’t understand it. Here’s how the left thinks: “An old English judge once said: ‘Necessitous men are not free men.’ Liberty requires opportunity to make a living – a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for. “For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people’s property, other people’s money, other people’s labor – other people’s lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. Against economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government. ” You many not agree with this approach but ALL the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs. Most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country. The sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value. But do not fear. Every year the top 1% become richer and richer. Every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages. Marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a government’s currency collapse. Once the currency collapses people in bread lines will DEMAND more government not less. See you in the breadlines comrades! хорошего дня JC Teecher It is fairly evident that B Hussein Odrama is spewing his NWO rhetoric and propaganda overseas, as he attempts to assume the role of the world’s authoritarian. He was handpicked by the biggest Nazi since Hitler, behind the scenes, as in GHW Bush. Odrama was chosen by the underworld as a successor to GHWB, and billery. Why?

Christ said the generation that sees it (nation of Israel) replanted in the Covenant land, will also see His return. Glory glory Hallelujah, we might just get out of this world………alive. Not fly away in a pre-trib rapture (trap), but change in the twinkling of an eye, here, in this earth, to be a part of the “Kingdom come, on Earth as it is in Heaven”. df NJ We just need to stop dropping bombs on ragheads and God will shower us with blessings.

I don't know how much the new Trump presidency will change the US intelligence agency culture. But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. It should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: * Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: ""Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!"" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. All of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. I think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. The easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources. Posted by: Stevens | Nov 18, 2016 2:16:40 PM | 2 Stevens @ 2: Great post, thanks. This ""regime change"" U$A foreign policy, has been implemented around the globe for many many years now, all in the interests of big corporate profits, and global hegemony. The sad truth seems to be, there are no signs its about to change. Posted by: ben | Nov 18, 2016 2:34:13 PM | 3 I was watching a travelogue program on PBS. The trip was to Cuba. The narrator traveled by train across the country. A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes. The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem. When I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of U.S. economic warfare. Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer, the small business operator, the basic family unit, etc., while rich people get richer. Isn't it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet? Our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds? Just my opinion Posted by: ALberto | Nov 18, 2016 3:00:02 PM | 4 Bernhard, I should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the US presidential elections and are glad that Killer Klinton's ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards. The focus is now on President-elect Donald Trump's likely cabinet appointments, who are the most likely choices for critical positions like Defense Secretary and State Secretary, what the process is and how that is being carried out (or not carried out), and what that says about Trump's leadership and decision-making style, how he plans on being President and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda (if it is genuine) of reforming the political culture on Capitol Hill, or ""draining the swamp"". If indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill, then there's a strong likelihood that the Soros-funded ""Color Revolution"" rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and we'll be seeing a re-enactment of the Kiev Maidan events there. Posted by: Jen | Nov 18, 2016 3:01:27 PM | 5 Does the Constitution of the United States require the president to have a specific number of executive departments? The answer is no. George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. Perhaps if Mr. Trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he ""drains the swamp"", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration. Posted by: PokeTheTruth | Nov 18, 2016 3:04:34 PM | 6 @2 stevens..thanks for your comments. lets hope open access to information continues.. the signs of this happening don't look great, but they remain open still.. thankfully, moa is one of many sites where sharing info is of great benefit and continues.. M K Bhadrakumar's latest.. meanwhile obama, merkel, hollandaze and their italian counterpart have all agreed to continue for another year, the sanctions on russia over ukraine.. the bozo head for nato jens stalenbread or however his name is spelled, continues on with the disingenuous musings of an old king about to reenact a version of humpty dumpty.. meanwhile the witch hunt on acedemics, or anyone associated with gulen continues in turkey.. erdogan was visiting pakistan the past few days and i happened to read this on the usa state dept daily transcript from yesterday in the form of a question. Question :""Turkish President Erdogan is in Pakistan today, and he publicly suggested to Pakistan that the West was behind ISIS in order to hurt Muslims, quote, “It is certain that Western countries are standing by Daesh. Now Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many others are suffering from terrorism and separatist terrorism.”What’s your comment on that? Do you think it’s a reasonable statement? MR KIRBY: No, I do not."" it is pretty funny how these daily press briefings highlight usa propaganda in such a distinct and colourful manner.. fortunately the odd journalist asks questions that lift the veil that is constantly being thrown out by these same masters of propaganda..

No, you will not be seeing ""Maidan"". Middle America white (and not only) working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still. So, if this rioting will come to Washington, who says that good ole' Ford Truck can not run over mountain bike of Tesla? Once the shooting starts (hopefully not) it will be a totally different game than Kiev ""Maidan"". There is also a trend, call it a hunch--most of US combat veterans from US endless wars tend to lean towards people like Trump.

When Obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let Iran retrieve their investments (which they may have done today, if you look at the huge market selloff), the Right again illegally crossed into Iran territory with their Navy patrol boats to create a false 'hostage' narrative. Those Navy boats know where they are by GPS withing 3.5 meters (10 feet), and Iran didn't beat them or waterboard them like AbuGraib or Gitmo, instead, they traded them for their *interest losses* on their illegally frozen foreign investments. With Huckabee as nee Ambassador to Israel, and neocon Pompeo as named CIA Director, and Jared Kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his Israeli blood-diamond partner Lev Leviev, you can bet the Xtian Soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the radioactive sands of the Middle East, filling up the VA hospitals again for the Judeo-Xtian Axis of Greater Isreal. If anyone else has a happier sitrep, we'd all like to hear it.

Merkel talked first while Obama stood off to the side with a ridiculous smirk on his bobble head. It was so horrible I couldn't watch.

I suspect that this is the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from Trump. The ""demonstrators"" paid and organized by Soros et al help set the background and provide the rationale for the ""need"" to ""accept the will of the people"". If this should transpire, then you will see civil unrest. The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton. Posted by: Perimetr | Nov 18, 2016 4:28:35 PM | 12 @12 Soros ""paid for"" protesters is just more of b's ""fake news"". I have friends, middle class professionals, who've been participating in California and all they know about Soros is he made a ton of $$ on Brit Currency bets 2 decades ago. The elector's ""switch"" is not going to happen, just more hysteria. Posted by: jdmckay | Nov 18, 2016 4:40:06 PM | 13 If this should transpire, then you will see civil unrest. The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton. Even the ""blue"" states have very large and populous ""red"" areas--mostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity. My point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once ""red"" states America gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as I already stated, ""Red"" states' America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. It is also tougher. Social and cultural composition of HRC's electorate speaks volumes--it is, in Steve Sailer's words (I think it was him), a ""coalition of the fringes"" and not very capable to start with. Posted by: SmoothieX12 | Nov 18, 2016 4:47:57 PM | 14 @10 It would be interesting to see the breakdown of the military vote. I don't hold my breath but, again--call it a hunch, I think that majority of US Armed Forces officer corps, especially officers ""in the field"" are Trump supporters. Posted by: SmoothieX12 | Nov 18, 2016 4:50:06 PM | 15 @13 WRT ""fake news"" and Soros paid rioters : Paul Horner — the 38-year-old self-made titan of a fake news empire on Facebook — is claiming responsibility for pushing Donald Trump to the White House, and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news. In an interview with The Washington Post, Horner attributed his success to Trumps’ particular base of supporters. He is the man behind such viral headlines as “The Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump” and “President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide” — neither of which were true. “My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist,” he told The Washington Post.

Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. For globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar.

Posted by: lysias | Nov 18, 2016 4:58:30 PM | 18 As a retired officer of the U.S. Navy, I would be very disappointed if a majority of the officer corps supported Hillary. It would be very disappointing if they put their increased chances of promotion in new wars over the good of the country. Disappointing, but not exactly surprising. Posted by: lysias | Nov 18, 2016 5:01:17 PM | 19 I find it interesting that this open thread was not suppose to be about the US election but darn near all of the comments are to one degree or another. Posted by: psychohistorian | Nov 18, 2016 5:12:13 PM | 20 It's great that there's some dialog between Trump and Putin. I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. But Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he's not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn't going to throw Israel under a bus. He's not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. Trump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. Now there's action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I'm surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don't hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It's like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. Trump's good will towards Russia certainly doesn't extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there's going to have to be some give and take. Putin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It's looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making. Posted by: peter | Nov 18, 2016 5:16:47 PM | 21 Putin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. Your timeline is a bit off. The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATO's 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia, while War of 08-08-08 was the start of Russia's return into big league. So, it is not a ""couple of years"". Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DC's neocon interventionist cabal. Posted by: SmoothieX12 | Nov 18, 2016 5:28:28 PM | 22 Who decides which news is fake? Buzzfeed did some analysis on Social media generated fake news during the election. An awful lot of it was simply false. You can look at some of those headlines and judge for yourself. Ironically, Paul Horner (guy behind ""fake news empire"" I linked in prior post) said: He said he didn’t do it for ideological reasons. “I hate Trump,” he told The Post. “I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn’t messing them up as much as I wanted — but I never thought he’d actually get elected.” Just happens 70% + of fake news this election cycle (according to Buzzfeed) was anti-Clinton. Posted by: jdmckay | Nov 18, 2016 5:47:15 PM | 23 ....and how the arms can flow from Libya and Zio-Ukraine to ISIS in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how 'upsetting'(sic) that is for Israel. Yeah, 'upsetting' to the Israel Likud former-Soviet mafia which fully supports ISIS and maintains 'Hezbullah' straw dog, to keep UN forces out of Greater Israel and torpedo the Two-State Solution and the Right-of-Return agreements which Netanyahu freely boasted he lied about supporting. http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/02/07/when-reagan-cut-and-run/ MoA isn't another Likud psyop disinformation campaign for the new Trump-Israel First Regime. Remember it was your team's counterfeit Yellow Cake Big Lie that assassinated the Baathists, and paved the way for Shi'ia's defensive action against the Bush-Cheney IL Wahhabi's usurpers and crusaders. You theory will do much better on Breitbart. Posted by: chipnik | Nov 18, 2016 5:52:07 PM | 24 @22 I was referring to his exclusion after annexing Crimea. The G8 turned into the G7 and he was shunned at the G20. It was decided by the US and its posse that world events would move along without any input from Russia. That changed when he entered Syria.

37,"Rep. Luis Gutierrez (  ) made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN, dismissing President Donald Trump’s offer to help Chicago end gun violence, and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City. [Gutierrez was reacting to Trump’s description of the “carnage” in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence. On January 24 Trump tweeted:  If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ”carnage” going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  The following day, Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said, “[President Trump] tweets about the “carnage” and that he’s going to send the feds in. Did he send any extra money for police officers? We could use that, for training. ” He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents —  ATF and FBI —  in the city as well. Then Gutierrez said: But  …    [President Trump is] with the NRA. The NRA that endorsed him, [that is]  …    so part of his relationship. You know that NRA did? It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts, so that we cannot keep guns off our streets. The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN, where he was again asked about Trump’s “carnage” assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence. Gutierrez said: Here’s the hypocrisy of it all. The fact is, Donald Trump loves the NRA. And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him. The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws, how were they eviscerated? Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures. Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the city’s gun controls were place. For example, the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991, 940 during 1992. 850 during 2993, and 930 during 1994. These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicago’s ban on handgun ownership was in place. Viewed in this light, the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicago’s most “stringent gun controls” were in effect.

38,"This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didn’t adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a child’s risk for developing allergies. They recommended that mothers “eliminate peanuts and tree nuts (e. g. almonds, walnuts, etc.) and consider eliminating eggs, cow’s milk, fish, and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing. ” Further, they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age, no dairy products until 1 year old, no eggs until age 2, and no peanuts, nuts or fish until age 3. A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic. I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children. We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies. To its credit, the A. A. P. changed its recommendations based on new research. In 2008, updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended. It also acknowledged that there didn’t seem much reason to delay the introduction of “allergy” foods like peanuts after six months, around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food. Unfortunately, this did little to change people’s behavior. Many had already internalized the advice. It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies. If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old, why not keep going? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head. Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies, between 4 and 11 months of age, in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups. One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals. All participants were followed until they were 5 years old. What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing. They were enrolled in the trial despite this, and half of them were given peanut extract every week. The results were remarkable. At the end of the study, about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy, compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts. More surprising, if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies, fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy. But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy. Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts, but consumed them in their diet regularly, were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them. Recently,   results were published. After the trial ended, researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months. At the end of that period, when the children were 6, there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group. Avoidance at this point made no difference. The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5. These results were so convincing that, once again, experts are changing their recommendations. In September 2015, the A. A. P.  —   along with others  —   argued that “health care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of ‘ ’ infants early on in life. ” These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis, the gist of which is that as we’ve made our environment more and more sterile, our immune systems develop differently than they used to. Without exposure to outside things to fight, our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances, leading to increased levels of eczema, asthma and allergies. Of course, many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances, so no one should take this as a call for living in filth. Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern. All changes to an infant’s diet, especially in children with allergies, should be done in consultation with a health care professional. As with many things in health care, however, we went too far with our response to peanut and other food allergies. Avoidance is sometimes needed for those with severe reactions. When we apply those same rules to everyone else, however, things can backfire.",0,934,16.98181818181818,55,0.3372591006423983,0,0,0,0,87.84860876133874,52.041399000713774,71.481727337616,19.385201046871284,0.8832976445396146,0.0053533190578158455,0.057815845824411134,0.031049250535331904,0.03961456102783726,0.014989293361884369,0.13383297644539616,0.0053533190578158455,0.013918629550321198,0.008565310492505354,0.055674518201284794,0,0.06209850107066381,0.06423982869379015,0.0010706638115631692,0.023554603854389723,0.013918629550321198,0.12098501070663811,0.0010706638115631692,0.05460385438972163,0.043897216274089934,0.055674518201284794,0,0.0010706638115631692,0.03747323340471092,0.01284796573875803,0.069593147751606,0,0.009635974304068522,0,0.004282655246252677,0,0.0010706638115631692,0.059957173447537475,0,0,0.4796573875802998,0.0417558886509636,0.0010706638115631692,0,0.0021413276231263384,0.06852248394004283,0,0.02569593147751606,0.023554603854389723,0.013918629550321198,0,0,0.0010706638115631692,0.021413276231263382,0.020342612419700215,0.021413276231263382,0,0,0.031049250535331904,0.2398286937901499,0.0021413276231263384,0.0010706638115631692,0.004282655246252677,0.057815845824411134,0.033190578158458245,0.04068522483940043,0.017130620985010708,0.028907922912205567,0.1777301927194861,0.11027837259100642,0.03961456102783726,0.0010706638115631692,0.007494646680942184,0.16274089935760172,0.0010706638115631692,0.006423982869379015,0.017130620985010708,0,0.0032119914346895075,0,0.0021413276231263384,0,0.10385438972162742,0.06423982869379015,0,0.023554603854389723,0.02569593147751606,0.07708779443254818,0.10492505353319058,0.11134903640256959,0.011777301927194861,0.031049250535331904,0.0010706638115631692,16,0,42.75,2,11.5,8.1,3.25,30,12,57.925,10,11,32,0,16,33.3,88.5,44.35,123.925,253.475,88.5,,0.325426500541308,0,0.5631205595712624,0.0568727151524708,0.2574651003780635,0.19628632142498223,0.08924587751619573,0.47493718553309977,0.2656851201282929,0.6359008283795836,0.23166247903553996,0.24905896520847187,0.4910517488648415,0,0.337221806149273,0.5010061655401405,0.07919640260408511,0.039687688762612146,0.11089733551086155,0.2268283406787624,-0.6016772693643081,0.7731716593212377,70
39,"A newly developed MRI scan allows parents to see detailed images of the beating heart of even a   unborn baby, as well as clear pictures of the baby stretching its legs and even swallowing in the womb. [The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, “Scans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. ”    “There is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,” she adds. “They are truly breathtaking. ” According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. “Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,” says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King’s College London who has participated in the project, says, “Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they’re still in the womb really isn’t that easy. ” He explains: For one thing, they’re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  —   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  —   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (‘echo’) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the baby’s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. “In fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, that’s not true for every patient,” Lloyd continues. “Ultrasound has to be able to ‘see’ through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn’t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. ” “MRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn’t so limited,” he explains. “It can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there’s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. ” “Importantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,” Lloyd adds.",0,542,24.636363636363637,22,0.25461254612546125,0,0,0,0,91.78123352662098,14.90965000559097,77.5290171083529,67.60753821823933,0.8763837638376384,0.016605166051660517,0.05904059040590406,0.05904059040590406,0.033210332103321034,0.02029520295202952,0.1937269372693727,0.0018450184501845018,0,0.02029520295202952,0.1033210332103321,0,0.07380073800738007,0.05719557195571956,0.025830258302583026,0.023985239852398525,0.016605166051660517,0.09225092250922509,0.0036900369003690036,0.07933579335793357,0.02029520295202952,0.04797047970479705,0,0,0.025830258302583026,0.00922509225092251,0.08118081180811808,0,0.03505535055350553,0.0018450184501845018,0.005535055350553505,0,0.0036900369003690036,0.012915129151291513,0.0018450184501845018,0.0018450184501845018,0.470479704797048,0.033210332103321034,0.00922509225092251,0.0036900369003690036,0,0.04981549815498155,0.0018450184501845018,0.0036900369003690036,0.007380073800738007,0.02214022140221402,0.01107011070110701,0.00922509225092251,0.0018450184501845018,0.007380073800738007,0.00922509225092251,0.005535055350553505,0,0.0018450184501845018,0.01845018450184502,0.23062730627306274,0.005535055350553505,0.0018450184501845018,0.06826568265682657,0.042435424354243544,0.04981549815498155,0.02029520295202952,0.027675276752767528,0.03690036900369004,0.14206642066420663,0.07011070110701106,0.023985239852398525,0,0.04059040590405904,0.12915129151291513,0,0.01107011070110701,0.0036900369003690036,0,0.05719557195571956,0,0.016605166051660517,0.005535055350553505,0.1033210332103321,0.07195571955719557,0,0.014760147601476014,0.007380073800738007,0.05166051660516605,0.12361623616236163,0.11623616236162361,0.0036900369003690036,0.03690036900369004,0.0036900369003690036,39.25,0,27.05,4,6,0,4,11.725,0,13.7,16.25,1,12,0,39.25,0,65.25,5,45.35,113.6,65.25,,0.6517099702983075,0,0.5632345048120877,0.16015261286229274,0.22241846975351037,0,0.16015261286229274,0.3585497859334493,0,0.3950839221537851,0.43652078525214494,0.045503819962193694,0.3638990660839066,0,0.250212886812842,0,0.10480244137487954,0.008030838419530999,0.07283970446514616,0.1824606488917443,0.5729521062075599,0.8175393511082557,33
40,"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesn’t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says “cow’s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.” It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better “milk” products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where it’s coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks aren’t the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients — they’ve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances you’ve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you don’t mind the taste. It’s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If you’re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but it’s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning there’s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. “ Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.” The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks don’t. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but it’s always good to check exactly where you’re getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. It’s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A",1,791,19.775,40,0.27307206068268014,0,0,0,0,79.11489876186462,14.070298433130288,59.99378002528445,70.93142682767339,0.8407079646017699,0.011378002528445006,0.07964601769911504,0.05562579013906448,0.039190897597977246,0.011378002528445006,0.15676359039190899,0.0012642225031605564,0.0025284450063211127,0.020227560050568902,0.06700379266750948,0.0012642225031605564,0.07711757269279393,0.1011378002528445,0.01390644753476612,0.021491782553729456,0.012642225031605562,0.11883691529709228,0.0037926675094816687,0.06447534766118837,0.05436156763590392,0.061946902654867256,0.007585335018963337,0.0012642225031605564,0.039190897597977246,0.008849557522123894,0.056890012642225034,0.0012642225031605564,0.0025284450063211127,0,0.0025284450063211127,0,0.0025284450063211127,0.020227560050568902,0,0,0.4589127686472819,0.022756005056890013,0.0025284450063211127,0,0,0.05941845764854614,0.0037926675094816687,0.07458912768647281,0.017699115044247787,0.018963337547408345,0.0050568900126422255,0.0012642225031605564,0.0025284450063211127,0.008849557522123894,0.01390644753476612,0.007585335018963337,0,0.0037926675094816687,0.02654867256637168,0.2667509481668774,0.0025284450063211127,0,0.02402022756005057,0.04804045512010114,0.035398230088495575,0.03286978508217446,0.0316055625790139,0.021491782553729456,0.13780025284450062,0.0922882427307206,0.040455120101137804,0,0.007585335018963337,0.0986093552465234,0,0.022756005056890013,0.0025284450063211127,0.0012642225031605564,0.0012642225031605564,0.0012642225031605564,0.0025284450063211127,0.0012642225031605564,0.05309734513274336,0.0632111251580278,0,0.03286978508217446,0.006321112515802781,0.025284450063211124,0.12262958280657396,0.11630847029077118,0.010113780025284451,0.02654867256637168,0.015170670037926675,55.762499999999996,0,30.125,0,27.35,0,2,24.875,7.585000000000001,33.125,26.5,15,12.5,0,55.762499999999996,10,107.6975,13,73.75,192.44749999999996,107.6975,,0.663469865318401,0,0.5157571624609003,0,0.4916034556891538,0,0.06604088253131131,0.4679334275333517,0.21146233910555717,0.5394136638833519,0.48371547885156396,0.34654620645552786,0.3064907038342117,0,0.6018221803257746,0.2612038749637414,0.11500644723809932,0.013882251808029815,0.07875508237247683,0.20550805037121672,0.6292691969043979,0.7944919496287832,47
41,"The fallout from Ryan Lochte’s story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio  —   a tale the Brazilian police said was not true  —   continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr. Lochte, an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist. After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil, the financial repercussions were swift for Mr. Lochte as Speedo USA, the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him. And Syneron Candela, a company that sells   devices, told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday. Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a $50, 000 portion of Mr. Lochte’s fee to a charity to help Brazilian children. “While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for,” the company said in its statement. On Monday, Kim Angelastro, a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela, wrote in an email, “We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners. ” Mr. Lochte was a spokesman for the company’s Gentle Hair Removal brand. Through a spokeswoman, Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr. Lochte’s endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics, and that his contract would not be renewed. Airweave said on Twitter that “after careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte. ” The decisions to cut ties with Mr. Lochte, 32, were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him. For the past week, he has been at the center of an international firestorm after the Brazilian police said he and three other American athletes  —   Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz  —   had fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom, paying a security guard about $50 for the damage before leaving. Mr. Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men, who held a gun to his head. But his story later changed. A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio, but Mr. Lochte had already left the country. After Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States, they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall. Mr. Feigen, 26, later donated $10, 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children. Mr. Lochte first issued an apology on social media  —   “I should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself,” he wrote  —   then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had “overexaggerated that story. ” He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint. “All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction, and we were demanded to give money,” Mr. Lochte said. Mr. Lochte, whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past, had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than he’d had at the London Games, according to a report by CNN Money. Mr. Lochte took home a gold medal in the   freestyle relay in Rio.",0,591,26.863636363636363,22,0.3197969543147208,0,0,0,0,94.02065372116134,11.758937481018696,93.59294480498619,51.07275803722504,0.7834179357021996,0.01353637901861252,0.030456852791878174,0.018612521150592216,0.030456852791878174,0.043993231810490696,0.16243654822335024,0.00338409475465313,0,0.008460236886632826,0.10321489001692047,0,0.07445008460236886,0.005076142131979695,0.001692047377326565,0.00676818950930626,0.005076142131979695,0.049069373942470386,0,0.05583756345177665,0.021996615905245348,0.03553299492385787,0,0,0.015228426395939087,0.01015228426395939,0.11336717428087986,0,0,0,0,0,0.00338409475465313,0.09813874788494077,0.005076142131979695,0.005076142131979695,0.45516074450084604,0.001692047377326565,0.021996615905245348,0.005076142131979695,0.005076142131979695,0.038917089678511,0.00338409475465313,0.001692047377326565,0.01015228426395939,0.008460236886632826,0.023688663282571912,0.05414551607445008,0.02707275803722504,0.023688663282571912,0.005076142131979695,0.008460236886632826,0.00338409475465313,0,0.02030456852791878,0.20473773265651438,0.015228426395939087,0,0.021996615905245348,0.06260575296108291,0.08460236886632826,0.05752961082910321,0.021996615905245348,0.05414551607445008,0.1353637901861252,0.09644670050761421,0.01015228426395939,0,0.02030456852791878,0.14382402707275804,0,0.005076142131979695,0.00676818950930626,0,0,0,0,0.025380710659898477,0.15905245346869712,0.06091370558375635,0,0.001692047377326565,0.008460236886632826,0.05922165820642978,0.12690355329949238,0.13874788494077833,0.018612521150592216,0.04230118443316413,0,19,0,41,0,4,0,0,0,4,23,17,18,16,0,19,0,56,4,58,114,56,,0.47528306714756435,0,0.6615445161164187,0,0.16015261286229274,0,0,0,0.16015261286229274,0.5230104476598908,0.44764906210497696,0.4618205632866772,0.43271104029591567,0,0.3638990660839066,0,0.08358208955223881,0.005970149253731343,0.08656716417910448,0.1701492537313433,-0.11881849050177154,0.8298507462686567,35
42,"Can I have one girlfriend without you bastards f**king it up? asks Harry 08-11-16 PRINCE Harry has asked the world’s media if he could just have one relationship that is not immediately ruined by bastard journalists. The prince has released a letter to the media asking if they could just one time not steam straight into a new girlfriend’s life and bollocks it all up. He continued: “Seriously you fuckers, the prince thing only gets you so far when she’s getting a hundred texts her day about her mum being followed by stubbly, fag-scented photographers. “And I do not need every newspaper in Britain muttering words like ‘Compton’ and ‘ghetto’ like a horrendously prejudiced grandparent. Especially as I already have a horrendously prejudiced grandparent. “Stop saying I could do better. You might think so, but by any realistic measure she’s already way out of my league, okay?” Following the letter, newspapers agreed that what would be lovely is getting out the family album to show this new girl photos of Harry dressed as a Nazi.

43,"A group of attorneys, scholars, and advocates put their names to a letter sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday, urging him to take a serious look at reform as he works with the President to select a new Assistant Attorney General for his Civil Rights Division. [“During the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,” the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which “The Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists. ” Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letter’s chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector General’s review that found the Obama Justice Department’s insistence that   have a “demonstrated commitment to civil rights” led to a perception only   activists need apply. “In this case, perception and reality were synonymous,” the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perez’s subsequent refusal to implement any of the report’s hiring recommendations. Also among the letter’s complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector General’s Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were “openly Christian. ” J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, “For years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses. ” In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letter’s signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Division’s entrenched cultural problems. “The next AAG certainly cannot be a proponent of the status quo by any means,” they say.",0,404,28.857142857142858,14,0.44801980198019803,0,0,0,0,99,2.941681451382133,71.54356435643564,18.472303987155474,0.698019801980198,0.017326732673267328,0.05693069306930693,0.009900990099009901,0.03712871287128713,0.0049504950495049506,0.15346534653465346,0.0049504950495049506,0.0049504950495049506,0.022277227722772276,0.11386138613861387,0,0.034653465346534656,0.0049504950495049506,0.0049504950495049506,0.009900990099009901,0.01485148514851485,0.06435643564356436,0,0.0594059405940594,0.01485148514851485,0.03217821782178218,0,0,0.009900990099009901,0.007425742574257425,0.08663366336633663,0,0,0,0,0,0.007425742574257425,0.027227722772277228,0,0,0.3712871287128713,0,0.0024752475247524753,0.0024752475247524753,0,0.027227722772277228,0,0,0.019801980198019802,0.007425742574257425,0,0.007425742574257425,0,0.009900990099009901,0.0024752475247524753,0.019801980198019802,0,0,0.0049504950495049506,0.16831683168316833,0.0024752475247524753,0,0.01485148514851485,0.034653465346534656,0.09653465346534654,0.012376237623762377,0.01485148514851485,0.05693069306930693,0.1485148514851485,0.039603960396039604,0.017326732673267328,0,0.034653465346534656,0.08168316831683169,0.0049504950495049506,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.0024752475247524753,0.007425742574257425,0,0,0.007425742574257425,0.06930693069306931,0.024752475247524754,0,0.007425742574257425,0.0049504950495049506,0.04702970297029703,0.07673267326732673,0.08168316831683169,0,0.0891089108910891,0,5,0,29,3,6,6,10,6,5,21,2,2,17,0,5,0,36,16,55,103,36,,0.23006275550355904,0,0.6341126285387454,0.15202805015514587,0.26393116059052896,0.26393116059052896,0.3740666961489728,0.26393116059052896,0.23006275550355904,0.556539061215455,0.10676232268609791,0.10676232268609791,0.5039545531571459,0,0.3740666961489728,0,0.07515657620041753,0.033402922755741124,0.11482254697286012,0.2150313152400835,-0.6162396753041385,0.7849686847599164,28
44,"Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday. One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes’s reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes’s exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailes’s service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailes’s departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox News’s place as a central hub for conservative opinion  —   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  —   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes’s current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailes’s successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailes’s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News’s   stars, like Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes’s loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailes’s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a woman’s appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  —   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlson’s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes’s leadership  —   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing “politically incorrect” themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Fox’s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  —   and perhaps even some deference  —   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.",0,986,29.87878787878788,33,0.3184584178498986,0,0,0,0,97.03826318249045,13.571096804538907,79.43058372774397,29.15240959641883,0.7677484787018256,0.013184584178498986,0.033468559837728194,0.018255578093306288,0.018255578093306288,0.006085192697768763,0.14198782961460446,0.002028397565922921,0.002028397565922921,0.016227180527383367,0.08823529411764706,0,0.056795131845841784,0.007099391480730223,0.0010141987829614604,0.011156186612576065,0.006085192697768763,0.0872210953346856,0,0.059837728194726165,0.02535496957403651,0.04665314401622718,0,0,0.02636916835699797,0.014198782961460446,0.08620689655172414,0,0.0030425963488843813,0,0.015212981744421906,0,0.009127789046653144,0.05172413793103448,0,0,0.43711967545638947,0.0030425963488843813,0.010141987829614604,0.0010141987829614604,0,0.04766734279918864,0.002028397565922921,0,0.018255578093306288,0.012170385395537525,0.004056795131845842,0.03144016227180527,0.011156186612576065,0.014198782961460446,0.010141987829614604,0.008113590263691683,0.0010141987829614604,0.0010141987829614604,0.02028397565922921,0.18661257606490872,0.006085192697768763,0,0.02028397565922921,0.057809330628803245,0.060851926977687626,0.02129817444219067,0.010141987829614604,0.061866125760649086,0.16734279918864098,0.06896551724137931,0.016227180527383367,0,0.002028397565922921,0.12778904665314403,0,0.008113590263691683,0.005070993914807302,0.0010141987829614604,0.008113590263691683,0,0.0030425963488843813,0.014198782961460446,0.11866125760649088,0.06693711967545639,0,0.018255578093306288,0.007099391480730223,0.04665314401622718,0.10953346855983773,0.10547667342799188,0,0.055780933062880324,0,11,0,31.75,0,9,17,26,4,4,22,4,13,16,0,11,16.5,49,59.5,54.475,161.975,49,,0.2998054113740869,0,0.5527462201609318,0,0.25943728223829415,0.39821538456769373,0.5029941193383307,0.13472338607037426,0.13472338607037426,0.4613081446662822,0.13472338607037426,0.3360000958152614,0.38378079831010925,0,0.182235086169468,0.39108362371618116,0.04434489468087514,0.053847372112491236,0.04929975791307496,0.14658702685581124,-0.2315901470742256,0.8534129731441887,43
45,"By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 2, 2016 Understanding Lebanon and the political realignment there critical to US understanding of the region...and to our future with Israel Lebanon has a new president. The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. On Monday, lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanon’s 13th president. The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah, especially after Saad Hariri, the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia, voiced his support for Aoun. On this edition of ‘The Debate,’ Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun. Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, praised Hariri’s measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syria’s spillover effects. Hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society, Mikhail said, adding that by his vote for General Aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war. Mikhail believes that the United States’ shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington. “I believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that America’s role in the Middle East is receding. So, perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East, is a new power. So, anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon,” Mikhail argued. Mikhail said that “so many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year. I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [Persian] Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities.” “He (Hariri) sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable. So, he is making calculations. I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. So, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and [Persian] Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this.” The image grab shows Gordon Duff (L), a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio, and Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, at Press TV’s ‘The Debate’ show on Monday night. Meanwhile, the other guest on the show, Gordon Duff, the editor of Veterans Today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind Hezbollah’s victory in Michel Aoun’s election is the movement’s victories in Syria, especially in Aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. “If Aleppo falls, and Aleppo will fall, it’s only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained Hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by Russia and by Iran, is going to return to Lebanon. It’s a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this. Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon that has been out of control,” Duff reiterated.

46,"Four Israeli soldiers were murdered and at least 16 people were wounded, some seriously, when an Arab resident of eastern Jerusalem rammed his truck into pedestrians near Jerusalem’s Armon Hanatziv Promenade. [Armon Hanatziv, also known as East Talpiot, is located in southeastern Jerusalem, part of the eastern sections of Jerusalem declared “occupied Palestinian territory” by a United Nations Security Council resolution last month.  The promenade, a popular tourist site enjoyed for its spectacular views of Israel’s capital, is located about half a mile from the plot of land upon which the U. S. has been building a consulate that could serve as a future embassy if the current embassy is moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters at the scene of the attack: “We know the identity of the attacker.  All signs point to the attacker being a supporter of the Islamic State. ” In Sunday’s vehicular terrorist attack, Fadi   identified as resident of the Jerusalem’s Jabel Mukaber Arab neighborhood, rammed a truck into a group of soldiers who were exiting a bus at the promenade. A video of the attack, obtained from security surveillance footage, shows the truck running over soldiers, then the vehicle spins around as the driver attempts to turn the truck around. He then runs over the group of soldiers a second time. Watch the video below. WARNING: Graphic images.  “The terrorist came from the direction of Alar Street. He noticed a group of people coming off a bus that stopped along the promenade. As far as we know, he sped up and hit them,” said Jerusalem District Police spokeswoman Galit Ziv. Qanbar was shot by a civilian tour guide and by soldiers at the scene. He immediately died of his wounds, police here said. The IDF released the following video testimony from one of the soldiers who responded to the attack by shooting Qanbar:   IDF soldiers reportedly raided Qanbar’s home after the attack, Magen David Adom paramedics at the scene said that a number of soldiers were trapped underneath the truck after it stopped when Qanbar was killed. An initial inquiry is focusing on reports that soldiers hesitated to initially shoot as Qanbar was perpetuating the attack. A military trainer who shot and killed the terrorist speculated that the hesitation might have stemmed from the conviction in a military court last week of Elor Azaria, an inexperienced    army combat medic who shot and killed a Palestinian terrorist in March after the terrorist stabbed an Israeli soldier and was lying on the ground supposedly neutralized after being shot. Azaria had said that he heard someone shout that the terrorist might be wearing an explosive device and he claimed that he acted to protect nearby soldiers. That claim was rejected by the military court. The military trainer, who would only identify himself as Eitan, told Israel’s Army Radio of the reported hesitation to show Qanbar:   …    the soldiers who were on the scene were hesitant to shoot at the truck that slammed into the group of people. The fact that Elor Azaria was convicted of manslaughter for shooting a wounded terrorist was the reason for this hesitation, according to Eitan. “There was hesitation to open fire. I have no doubt that this was a significant factor, because all they tell them recently is to be careful. It could be that a few minutes less of hesitation and the situation would have been better,” he added. No terrorist group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Hamas’s   military wing, however, took to Facebook to praise the carnage as a “heroic” operation.  Hamas spokesperson Hazaem Qassem wrote that “the continuous operations in the West Bank and Jerusalem prove that the Jerusalem Intifada is not an isolated event, but rather a decision by the Palestinian people to revolt until they attain their freedom and liberation from the Israeli occupation. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

48,"Comments Last night, Louisiana Senate candidates vying for disgraced Senator David Vitter’s empty seat took the stage at the historically black Dillard University. Among them was former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, who is making yet another run for public office. The students at Dillard rightfully came out to protest – but were met with shocking violence from the police. Seventy or so students protested Duke’s presence at their college. “They’re allowing a terrorist, a neo-Nazi Ku Klux Klan member to be secured in a building in which we paid thousands of dollars to attend annually,” said political science major Brielle Kennedy , who was arrested moments later. Nobody was allowed in the building during the debate, but students tried to enter anyway to express their fury – and were met with pepper-spray and beatings from police, who arrested six students. “They sprayed us directly in the face with it. I was covered on my shirt, my arms, my face. They’re bodyslamming people, they pulled girls’ hair. They’re just acting like heathens” recounted student Hannah Galloway. The debate itself went off the rails almost immediately as David Duke began complaining about “Jews ,” saying that “there is a problem in America with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media, dominates our international banking.” He then went on to say that “[Hillary Clinton] should be getting the electric chair, being charged with treason.” What did the police and state board of elections expect would happen when they held a debate at a historically black school in the deep South and invited a deplorable white supremacist and prominent Trump supporter to attend? The violence with which the police reacted evokes the violence that white police visited on black protesters during Jim Crow and the battle for African-American civil rights – and is a painful symbol of how little has changed in the past sixty years. The fact that David Duke had the support to qualify for the ballot is evidence enough.",1,337,22.466666666666665,15,0.37091988130563797,0,0,0,0,92.09361808835207,18.977490843959686,84.35481136074608,1.707060569034735,0.7922848664688428,0.01483679525222552,0.032640949554896145,0.032640949554896145,0.06528189910979229,0.026706231454005934,0.1572700296735905,0.017804154302670624,0.002967359050445104,0.017804154302670624,0.08605341246290801,0,0.06231454005934718,0.020771513353115726,0.01483679525222552,0.017804154302670624,0.005934718100890208,0.050445103857566766,0,0.04154302670623145,0.011869436201780416,0.04451038575667656,0.008902077151335312,0,0.008902077151335312,0.011869436201780416,0.11275964391691394,0,0,0.002967359050445104,0.002967359050445104,0.002967359050445104,0.005934718100890208,0.0712166172106825,0,0,0.4332344213649852,0.002967359050445104,0.008902077151335312,0,0.011869436201780416,0.04451038575667656,0.002967359050445104,0.002967359050445104,0.002967359050445104,0.02373887240356083,0.002967359050445104,0.01483679525222552,0.008902077151335312,0.02967359050445104,0.002967359050445104,0.04747774480712166,0,0,0.011869436201780416,0.20771513353115728,0.01483679525222552,0,0.026706231454005934,0.04154302670623145,0.06231454005934718,0.04451038575667656,0.017804154302670624,0.06824925816023739,0.13353115727002968,0.08902077151335312,0.005934718100890208,0.002967359050445104,0.02967359050445104,0.14836795252225518,0.002967359050445104,0.005934718100890208,0.005934718100890208,0.002967359050445104,0.01483679525222552,0,0,0.002967359050445104,0.11275964391691394,0.06824925816023739,0,0.005934718100890208,0.017804154302670624,0.050445103857566766,0.12759643916913946,0.13056379821958458,0.011869436201780416,0.050445103857566766,0,16,0,73.625,4,0,0,11.175,18,1,25,1,0,2,10,16,10,20,21.175,123.625,150.625,20,,0.4801847547959174,0,0.8095507030289621,0.1876127897984334,0,0,0.39216707315122634,0.5096189432334203,0.054583639049126324,0.5907301480239404,0.054583639049126324,0,0.10351694645735657,0.36602540378443865,0.10351694645735657,0.36602540378443865,0.04370390603660202,0.04627151051625239,0.27014476918874625,0.329145042338159,-0.8943023225119345,0.670854957661841,30
49,"Despite stringent gun controls that read like a Democrat   for U. S. gun policy, a new study shows the province of Ontario, Canada, witnesses one “child or youth” shot every day. [The study was conducted by the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  According to The Star, the lead author of the study, Dr. Natasha Saunders, said, “A child or youth injured by a gun each day in this province is staggering. ” She believes this should serve as impetus for doctors to be more involved in the conversation about firearms in Ontario, including conversations between doctors and their patients. Saunders said, “Our findings indicate that this is a conversation we should be having with our patients and their families, particularly with these     populations. ” The study shows that   children and youth are prone to accidental shootings while immigrants of the same age are prone to being shot intentionally. It also shows that children and youth in rural areas were more prone to accidental shootings while those in urban environments were prone to assaults with firearms. The study offers this explanation: The observed variation in firearm injury by region of origin may have been related to higher participation in Canadian gangs by   Caribbean and African immigrants than by those from other regions, and it highlights the need to ensure a healthy transition to Canada by these particular   groups. It is interesting to note that Canada has all the gun controls Democrats in the U. S. push as a means of keeping citizens safe. They have criminal background checks, mental background checks, and licensing requirements for gun ownership that include domestic abuse checks. In fact, The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy. org reveals that “licensing authorities are required to conduct interviews with, or to advise an applicant’s spouse, partner, or next of kin before issuing a gun licence. ” This is clearly a step intended to discover any problem that may have slipped through the cracks during the numerous other checks required for a gun license. But despite these controls —  and so many more —  one “child or youth” is shot every day in Ontario. These same “restrictive” controls also proved impotent to stop a determined attacker who killed six and wounded eight in Quebec on January 29. Breitbart News reported: The Quebec attack was similar to those in other European countries with restrictive gun control laws. For example, twelve people were shot and killed on January 7, 2015, when terrorists opened fire on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in   Paris. Just months later, on November 13, 2015, more terrorists in Paris opened fire and killed 130 innocents.

50,"Normani Kordei, a member of the girl group on the rise Fifth Harmony, sat for a lighthearted Facebook Live interview earlier this month. Within a week, she had been chased off Twitter by a mob spewing racist insults. “I’ve not just been cyber bullied, I’ve been racially cyber bullied with tweets and pictures so horrific and racially charged that I can’t subject myself any longer to the hate,” she wrote. Her account has been silent since. Online harassment has become a depressingly common workplace hazard for people of color in the public eye. Last month, the “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones temporarily quit Twitter after weathering a deluge of racist abuse. And last year, the Brazilian actress Taís Araújo reported a series of harassers to the police after they had inundated her Facebook page with similar comments. But the racist taunts hurled at Ms. Kordei didn’t originate from some white supremacist message board, or even from a crew of Fifth Harmony haters. It came from within the Fifth Harmony fandom itself. The incident illuminates some strange similarities between the bands of internet trolls stalking the web and the legions of online fans seeking to stir up some drama. They both know that the most hurtful weaponry to wield against black women include images of apes, threats of lynching and a    . Fifth Harmony is a Simon   girl group that snagged its first Top 10 hit this year with the saucy single “Work From Home. ” Its brand would best be described as “gyrating girl power. ” But when Ms. Kordei sat down with the digital lifestyle magazine Galore for the Facebook Live interview on the subject of female friendship, one question  —   “Describe each girl in one word”  —   ripped a fault line through the group’s young, female fan base. Of her bandmate Ally Brooke, Ms. Kordei said: “Sunshine, because she is literally the light of the group. ” Of Lauren Jauregui: “My therapist, I can go to her about absolutely anything, and I feel like I can trust that she won’t judge anything that I say. ” And Dinah Jane: “She’s like the   queen, she just has a good time anywhere she is. ” When she reached Fifth Harmony’s final member, Camila Cabello, she paused. “She is   …     let’s see. Camila. Very quirky. Yeah, very quirky. Um, cute. Quirky. ” That’s it. But that was enough to enrage some fans of Ms. Cabello, the    who has been positioned as Fifth Harmony’s breakout star (and earned a spot in Taylor Swift’s squad). To this set, Ms. Kordei’s answer was apparently insufficiently effusive. “Camila is a lot more than cute and quirky she’s kind, classy, mature and hardworking,” one fan tweeted. The backlash soon grew big enough to hit the teen gossip sites (“OMG: Did Normani Kordei Throw Shade at Camila Cabello?” the magazine   asked) before curdling into something more sinister. In fan enclaves across the web, a subset of Fifth Harmony followers called Ms. Kordei “Normonkey,” “coon,” and “nigger. ” One said she “deserves to be lynched. ” Another Photoshopped her face onto the body of a woman hanging from a tree. This is the kind of rhetoric you expect to see on 4chan’s political message board, a den of white supremacist rhetoric fused with ironic memes. The trolls of 4chan have lately helped power the online presence of the   the folks who led the Twitter assault against Ms. Jones. Now the internet’s most unruly celebrity fans are cribbing their troublemaking tactics from the same playbook. The firestorm against Ms. Jones was touched off by a nasty review of “Ghostbusters” published by Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative provocateur. As the attacks built, comment threads unspooled inside 4chan, surfacing racist images and commentary to hurl at Ms. Jones in Twitter’s open marketplace. Abuse against Ms. Kordei was organized, too, by an anonymous Twitter account that popped up directing fans to inundate her with slurs. Trolls thrive off provoking a response from their targets. When Ms. Jones began speaking out against the abuse on Twitter, 4chan posters traded gleeful messages. Fans, too, delight in forging some connection with the stars, even if it comes in the form of a rebuke. The abuse against Ms. Kordei escalated after she took to Twitter to deny a feud with Ms. Cabello and to denounce the fans attempting to stir up trouble. That behavior eventually scored a response from Ms. Cabello, too. “You don’t have to hate on somebody else to support me  —   I don’t appreciate it and it’s not what I’m about,” she tweeted. “Be kind or move on. ” Most Fifth Harmony fans, who call themselves Harmonizers, are not racists. As the abuse mounted, support for Ms. Kordei poured out under the hashtags #IStandWithNormani and #WeLoveYouNormani. Still, racially tinged remarks about Ms. Kordei have been a   presence amid her rise in popularity  —   fans have expressed surprise that she reads books and called her “ugly” and “ape” —   and the abuse tends to flare at dramatic moments within the roiling fan narrative of imagined alliances and feuds (like the supposed ongoing beef between Ms. Kordei and Ms. Cabello). A similar dynamic has played out among One Direction fans, some of whom have greeted Zayn Malik, the group’s lone Muslim member, with death threats and slurs like “terrorist. ” He briefly quit Twitter in 2012, citing Islamophobia, and left the band last year. And when Robert Pattinson started dating the singer FKA Twigs in 2014, a subgroup of his fans inundated her with racist abuse on Twitter that left her “genuinely shocked and disgusted. ” Some level of infighting is embedded within pop fandom itself. Like One Direction before it, Fifth Harmony is a   pop group that’s been perfectly primed to exploit differences in personality, style and ethnic background of the group’s singers. The Spice Girls played this trick most baldly, naming and dressing members after a singular trait  —   Baby, Scary, Sporty, Posh and Ginger. But supporting a favorite bandmate can easily degrade into trashing a least favorite. In a New York Post article from 1998, one    Spice Girls fan said of Ginger (Geri Halliwell): “A lot of people don’t like her. I think some people hate her the most out of all of them. ” She added: “I personally don’t like Scary Spice, though. ” Typically, girl group loyalism falls into the benign end of human  . But in the crucible of online fandom, demographic distinctions can coarsen into warring factions. A fan fantasy that frames the band members as hating one another  —   and paints one of them as rude, stupid, evil, and deserving of death because she is black  —   is no longer just idle fan fictions. As Ms. Kordei put it in one of her notes to fans, “For those of you who enjoy speculating creating drama that doesn’t exist, please keep in mind that myself and the other girls in the group are PEOPLE. ” She added: “This is our story so let us write it our way, instead of you trying to write it for us. ”",0,1188,18.857142857142858,63,0.31986531986531985,0,0,0.0016835016835016834,0,92.10216179230264,7.144101421096726,83.3503367003367,18.337155337155338,0.7878787878787878,0.009259259259259259,0.049663299663299666,0.026094276094276093,0.07323232323232323,0.03872053872053872,0.21043771043771045,0.025252525252525252,0.004208754208754209,0.022727272727272728,0.07912457912457913,0.0016835016835016834,0.05303030303030303,0.008417508417508417,0.0025252525252525255,0.007575757575757576,0.003367003367003367,0.0664983164983165,0.005892255892255892,0.05555555555555555,0.031144781144781145,0.04713804713804714,0,0.005050505050505051,0.02356902356902357,0.0025252525252525255,0.09259259259259259,0,0.0016835016835016834,0.0025252525252525255,0.05303030303030303,0,0.003367003367003367,0.034511784511784514,0.003367003367003367,0.003367003367003367,0.43265993265993263,0.0025252525252525255,0.01430976430976431,0.0016835016835016834,0.015151515151515152,0.04040404040404041,0.012626262626262626,0.0016835016835016834,0.008417508417508417,0.008417508417508417,0.02441077441077441,0.003367003367003367,0.004208754208754209,0.012626262626262626,0.011784511784511785,0.03872053872053872,0.008417508417508417,0.0008417508417508417,0.02356902356902357,0.20707070707070707,0.008417508417508417,0.003367003367003367,0.030303030303030304,0.06986531986531987,0.050505050505050504,0.05808080808080808,0.03367003367003367,0.03787878787878788,0.14562289562289563,0.09848484848484848,0.031144781144781145,0.0008417508417508417,0.04377104377104377,0.10521885521885523,0.0016835016835016834,0.007575757575757576,0.005892255892255892,0.0025252525252525255,0.010942760942760943,0,0,0.027777777777777776,0.1388888888888889,0.058922558922558925,0.0008417508417508417,0.026094276094276093,0.005892255892255892,0.034511784511784514,0.1026936026936027,0.09848484848484848,0.005050505050505051,0.016835016835016835,0.004208754208754209,79.7625,0,238.315625,0,27.025,8.875,3,180.146875,61.025,108.375,7,92.7,58,11.725,79.7625,29.83,223.4875,43.705,414.17187500000006,675.6893749999999,223.4875,,0.6920285161347732,0,0.8703619079685722,0,0.43225145282122296,0.20001587191369583,0.07792920551222468,0.8353926606603849,0.6322426968878027,0.7532764727263231,0.16471953004969767,0.7231087853664581,0.6203442183846642,0.248298027150687,0.4479249965617188,0.4566295412558389,0.1294312128375725,0.02531144317720725,0.23986472668252798,0.3913207463849715,-0.883680994199738,0.6086792536150285,137
51,"WASHINGTON  —   Michelle Obama has burned off her   meals at Washington’s new generation of acclaimed restaurants by pedaling at SoulCycle. President Obama has shopped for Jonathan Franzen novels with his daughters at local independent bookstores. Obama administration staff members, their barhopping chronicled in the gossip pages, have hit the 14th Street hot spots hard. Decades ago, Washington was broke and run by a mayor best known for smoking crack with a friend on a surveillance tape. Neighborhoods had not fully recovered from the 1968 riots, and an aging Georgetown elite still set the tone. The administrations of two Bushes and a Clinton in between hardly had an effect on the city. But Mr. Obama’s arrival in 2009 coincided with an urban renaissance. Economic development, federal and private investment, and an influx of highly educated young, gay and diverse professionals gentrified neighborhoods, leading to an explosion in restaurants, bars and cafes. And the Obama family  —     youthful, attractive and urbane  —   were archetypes of a modern city on the upswing. What the effect on Washington will be when Donald J. Trump moves into the White House is hard to predict. But many Washingtonians fear the worst. Among them is Vincent Gray, the city’s mayor during much of the Obama administration. “I’m worried about people not wanting to come here because of the image they have of the Trump administration,” Mr. Gray said. Now a member of the City Council, Mr. Gray said the engagement of Mr. Obama and his family with the city has been “tremendously uplifting. ” “Their presence in the city brought a level of dynamism that just wasn’t there before,” he said. By contrast, Mr. Trump seems unlikely to drop in at Oyamel, the Mexican restaurant and Obama favorite owned by José Andrés, a star chef and devoted Trump critic. For that matter, it is even unclear whether Mr. Trump, who has used his new Trump International Hotel as an outpost here, will spend weekends in the White House or in New York. And he is unlikely to feel a debt of gratitude to a city where Hillary Clinton won 93 percent of the vote. “D. C. is going to take a really hard hit, culturally, socially, everything. We were really finding our footing we weren’t second to New York,” said Jazmine Johnson, a graphic designer who said she now planned to move to New York. Ms. Johnson, 25, was speaking in the Coffee Bar, a fashionable cafe on M Street where Mr. Trump’s   “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” played in the background. In the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s election victory on Tuesday, she sought solace in caffeine. Others around town signed up for free   sessions at yoga studios, or meditated on emails from their progressive rabbis reminding them of the Jewish mantra “Od lo avda tikvateinu,” or, “We have not yet lost our hope. ” Reports abounded of federal workers and nonprofit employees crying at their desks, scanning the web for    rentals or accepting the free hugs on offer in Farragut Square. “The world has definitely shifted on its axis, and we’ve taken a step into the abyss,” said Michael Steel, an establishment Republican by virtue of having worked for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and departed House Speaker John Boehner, and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Gray said he worried that a Trump administration could set the city back because the federal government still controls its purse strings and could enact abortion restrictions, cut vital investment and relax gun control laws. But Democrats now in the government and thinking of leaving it, and young people who had hopes of joining it, have a more immediate concern  —   a job. Meredith Lightstone, 21, who led the University of Maryland’s Terps for Hillary club, had been preparing her résumé for positions in a Clinton administration. She said she had no interest in a role in the Trump White House. “Do I go into government or politics, or another route? Maybe tech?” she asked. “T. B. D. ” At least some Washington institutions are likely to remain shockproof. The lucrative real estate market seems to be one. Andrew C. Florance, a Washington resident and founder of CoStar, a provider of data, marketing and analytic services to the commercial real estate industry, said he expected a wave of “glitzier” New Yorkers  —   “the Delta Shuttle crew”  —   to join the Trump administration and quickly become part of the city’s lobbying ranks and downtown neighborhoods. “It will be a terrific real estate market,” he said. Lobbying firms on K Street are already treating Mr. Trump’s election as a bonanza and are gearing up for more work. Conservative think tanks are looking forward to serving up new ideas to Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress. James Wallner, a vice president for research at the Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Trump’s election was met with  . “Trump is a change agent,” Mr. Wallner said. “As long as everyone is trying to change Washington, that’s all that matters. ” Liberal and environmental groups are determined to stay and fight. Debbie Sease, who heads lobbying for the Sierra Club, presided over a   office of employees who took silent Metro rides into work last week and hung “free hugs” signs on their desks. She expects an invigorated resistance to come to Washington, bringing moral outrage as well as sophisticated palates. “I’d be surprised if all the good restaurants disappear or become steakhouses,” she said. Cork, the wine bar that pioneered 14th Street’s restaurant boom during the Obama years, set up televisions for an election night watch party. It turned into a   tragedy with the owner, Diane Gross, telling her mother to calm down or she would have a heart attack. Jen Psaki, the White House communications director, had her engagement party at Cork, Mrs. Obama dropped in, and Jill Biden became a regular there. Ms. Gross said she hoped that Washington, despite its reputation as a transitory place, had reached a cultural critical mass that would prevent   hemorrhaging of the young, fashionable and talented. Still, she acknowledged, “there’s a real possibility of people going back to wherever they are from to do progressive politics there. ” Mike O’Malley, an owner of the Red Hen, a popular restaurant in the recently gentrified neighborhood of Bloomingdale, said he expected his patrons to stay put. “There are things that make people want to live here besides government,” he said, as diners commiserated at the bar over Mrs. Clinton’s loss. “People are living here as opposed to working here. ” Mr. Trump must now populate the federal government with new appointees, but some members of his inner circle are already entrenched in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, whom Mr. Trump named chief strategist and senior counsel on Sunday, lives, works and entertains out of a   townhouse near the Supreme Court. David Bossie, another key aide to Mr. Trump, runs Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group, out of a Capitol Hill townhouse. And there will be newcomers like Richard B. Spencer, who took a break from reveling with other ecstatic supporters in the lobby bar of the Trump International Hotel on election night to declare the party over for the Washington establishment. “We are winners and we have displaced them,” said Mr. Spencer, a leader of the “ ” movement who champions white identity politics and is currently looking for Beltway headquarters for his movement. He added, “We want to become the new establishment. ”",0,1251,18.130434782608695,69,0.31654676258992803,0,0,0,0,94.61803255808051,14.410217280720875,83.3306554756195,59.051862509992006,0.7881694644284573,0.01838529176658673,0.05195843325339728,0.030375699440447643,0.04636290967226219,0.027977617905675458,0.2006394884092726,0.0031974420463629096,0.002398081534772182,0.01598721023181455,0.08792965627498002,0.0015987210231814548,0.055955235811350916,0.023181454836131096,0.0015987210231814548,0.011191047162270184,0.005595523581135092,0.07034372501998401,0,0.07034372501998401,0.014388489208633094,0.051159072741806554,0,0.0007993605115907274,0.019984012789768184,0.013589128697042365,0.10631494804156674,0,0.0031974420463629096,0.004796163069544364,0.01598721023181455,0,0.009592326139088728,0.04716227018385292,0.004796163069544364,0.004796163069544364,0.42525979216626697,0.005595523581135092,0.016786570743405275,0.011191047162270184,0.002398081534772182,0.027977617905675458,0.004796163069544364,0.015187849720223821,0.015187849720223821,0.012789768185451638,0.02717825739408473,0.025579536370903277,0.010391686650679457,0.023980815347721823,0.005595523581135092,0.014388489208633094,0.003996802557953637,0.0007993605115907274,0.007993605115907274,0.20463629096722621,0.004796163069544364,0,0.037569944044764186,0.07114308553157474,0.09272581934452438,0.04156674660271783,0.0319744204636291,0.05755395683453238,0.14068745003996802,0.06954436450839328,0.012789768185451638,0.0015987210231814548,0.03677058353317346,0.14468425259792167,0.0031974420463629096,0.009592326139088728,0.0031974420463629096,0.003996802557953637,0.01598721023181455,0,0.0015987210231814548,0.02238209432454037,0.11590727418065548,0.08313349320543566,0,0.019184652278177457,0.007993605115907274,0.042366107114308556,0.11830535571542766,0.12070343725019984,0.007194244604316547,0.050359712230215826,0.0015987210231814548,31,4,35,0,27,0,25,26,28,65.375,21,35,61,0,31,10,179,37,141.375,357.375,179,,0.454889948693117,0.09720924117892499,0.4851115707772239,0,0.4208993602678377,0,0.4022632861593848,0.41172888109708655,0.4297883133831808,0.6376596083528114,0.3611452354443896,0.4851115707772239,0.6215081479014017,0,0.4851115707772239,0.21209649407822984,0.11835688899909083,0.024464831804281346,0.09347879990081825,0.23630052070419044,0.5888765232425924,0.7636994792958096,96
52,"WASHINGTON  —   The Federal Reserve is struggling to adapt to an economy that refuses to boom. The Fed said on Wednesday, after a   meeting of its   committee, that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, and that future increases were most likely to unfold at a slower pace. The   period since the end of the Great Recession has become one of the longest economic expansions in American history and, at the same time, one of the most disappointing. The Fed, in a statement announcing its decision, noted what had become a typical mix of good news and bad. Economic output has increased while job growth has slowed, the Fed said. Consumers are spending more while companies are making fewer investments. Exports are rebounding, but Britain’s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union could set off another round of disruptions. “Recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,” the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told a news conference. The decision to wait was unanimous. Even Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted to raise rates at the Fed’s last few meetings, agreed this time that the moment was not ripe. “The labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,” Ms. Yellen said. Investors already are heavily discounting the chances of a rate increase at the Fed’s next meeting in July, or at the following meeting in September. Those chances, derived from asset prices, stood at 12 percent and 28 percent respectively on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In this environment of tepid growth and weak inflation, Fed officials once again dialed back their expectations for future rate increases. The Fed in December had predicted four rate increases this year. On Wednesday, the Fed released new projections showing that 15 of its 17 policy makers now expected no more than two increases this year, and six of those officials predicted just one. Even more striking, the median prediction of Fed officials was that the central bank’s benchmark rate would rise to just 2. 4 percent by the end of 2018, down from the March median of 3 percent. That suggests officials increasingly regard mediocre global economic growth as an enduring malaise. The Fed also appears increasingly open to the view that a shift in basic economic dynamics, driven by factors like lower productivity growth and an aging population, is holding down interest rates. That means low rates are less stimulative than they would have been in earlier eras. “It means that long rates can remain low without causing the economy to overheat, and therefore the urgency of tightening is very substantially diminished,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist. Markets are even more pessimistic than the Fed. The yield on the benchmark   Treasury fell to 1. 574 percent, the lowest level since 2012. That is part of a broader decline in global rates that, in recent days, also has sent the yield on   German debt below zero for the first time. Equity markets, which in recent years have often celebrated when central banks hold down rates, also declined modestly on Wednesday. The Standard  Poor’s   index fell 0. 18 percent to close at 2, 071. 50. Fed officials increasingly think the economy has exited its postcrisis period, according to economic projections the central bank published on Wednesday. The recovery, in other words, may not be complete, but it is over. Most officials predicted stable growth around 2 percent over the next few years, and they foresaw little if any additional decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 7 percent in May, the lowest level unemployment had reached since 2007, before the recession. But economic growth has disappointed expectations, and the Fed’s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent after a single rate increase last December. As recently as late May, Ms. Yellen predicted the Fed would raise rates in “the coming months. ” On Wednesday, she downgraded a summer move to “not impossible. ” Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said the Fed was standing still because the basic economic situation had been remarkably stable. For the last several years, the labor market has gradually improved while inflation has been sluggish. “I suspect that the core policy developments have never been so static for so long,” Mr. Faust wrote. Under those circumstances it makes perfect sense for the Fed to watch and wait. Consumer spending has driven domestic economic growth, and Ms. Yellen said she expected the trend to continue on the back of job growth and rising wages. But Fed officials were surprised by the slow pace of job growth in May, when the economy was estimated to have added just 38, 000 jobs. And a Fed index that summarizes labor market conditions has fallen to the lowest level in seven years. Officials also have expressed increased concern about inflation expectations, which play a significant role in determining future inflation. (Workers, for example, may seek larger raises if they expect prices to rise more quickly.) The University of Michigan’s consumer survey reported last week that consumers expected 2. 3 percent annual inflation in five years, the lowest level in the survey’s history. Ms. Yellen emphasized again on Wednesday that Fed officials also saw significant risks in moving too quickly. Because interest rates already are low, the Fed has little room to ease conditions if growth falters. Officials say it will be easier to respond to faster inflation than to an economic downturn. Some economists see evidence that the Fed itself is playing a role in the slowdown. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, and officials have made clear that they would like to keep raising rates. Moreover, the decline in the Fed’s projection of   interest rates suggests that the Fed may have underestimated the impact of its actions in December. But Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed’s move in December amounted to a small adjustment in rates, and that she did not agree with critics that it had an outsize impact. “I really don’t think that a single rate increase in December has had much significance for the outlook,” she said.",0,1082,18.033333333333335,60,0.34473197781885395,0,0,0,0,94.74286301088519,62.558750370826765,54.06398407507464,28.847381392483054,0.83271719038817,0.00831792975970425,0.05730129390018484,0.029574861367837338,0.031423290203327174,0.0046210720887245845,0.14695009242144177,0,0.0018484288354898336,0.010166358595194085,0.0933456561922366,0.0009242144177449168,0.06746765249537892,0.025878003696857672,0,0.012939001848428836,0.0046210720887245845,0.08133086876155268,0,0.06007393715341959,0.036044362292051754,0.04251386321626617,0,0,0.02310536044362292,0.0166358595194085,0.06561922365988909,0,0,0.0009242144177449168,0.009242144177449169,0,0.021256931608133085,0.06561922365988909,0,0,0.4214417744916821,0.0009242144177449168,0.010166358595194085,0.0018484288354898336,0.0018484288354898336,0.04805914972273567,0.0009242144177449168,0.024953789279112754,0.012939001848428836,0.0073937153419593345,0.0036968576709796672,0.0009242144177449168,0.04343807763401109,0.04343807763401109,0.009242144177449169,0.014787430683918669,0,0,0.03974121996303143,0.25046210720887246,0.0009242144177449168,0.0009242144177449168,0.02033271719038817,0.06192236598890943,0.07763401109057301,0.012939001848428836,0.0166358595194085,0.04251386321626617,0.13401109057301294,0.06099815157116451,0.02865064695009242,0,0.012939001848428836,0.21164510166358594,0,0.0046210720887245845,0.0073937153419593345,0.010166358595194085,0.00831792975970425,0,0,0.0036968576709796672,0.041589648798521256,0.08872458410351201,0,0.01756007393715342,0.0046210720887245845,0.08964879852125693,0.14417744916820702,0.13123844731977818,0.0027726432532347504,0.06284658040665435,0,28,0,17,17.025,19.275,32,0,24.675,14,47,19.65,8,2.3,0,28,12,73.575,42,137.425,246,73.575,,0.4469914717273348,0,0.32919569107949315,0.32952027789636473,0.35750044932627173,0.4801847547959174,0,0.41599219908882823,0.2878229343817586,0.5756910216900448,0.3619383351604741,0.1876127897984334,0.06226141670210206,0,0.6538183742723062,0.2572842744474721,0.05904895666131622,0.033707865168539325,0.11029293739967898,0.19743178170144463,-0.7227355722740925,0.8025682182985554,82
53,"The Muslim Bloc may have won the battle, but did Israel win the war? October 28, 2016 Ari Lieberman By now it should be clear to all but the blindest (or rabidly disingenuous) that the United Nations is an organization that has been co-opted by the nefarious interests of Muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. It is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. An organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today's greatest purveyor of Judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. This fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that deny the indisputable Jewish nexus to the holy city. On April 12, the 58-member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly one-sided resolution that referred to Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem exclusively by their Muslim names and designated the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site, as a “Muslim holy site of worship.” To add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that Israel was “planting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteries.” Unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven Muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. Two nations were absent for the vote. France, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. That the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of Muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of UNESCO but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner European support and Israel could thus claim a moral victory. France with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the world’s despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. But following the vote, a crack appeared in the façade of anti-Israel invective so prevalent at the U.N. It appeared that France was having a case of buyer’s remorse. In an address to the French parliament, Prime Minister Manuel Valls termed the resolution “clumsy” and “unfortunate.” He then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that “France will never deny the Jewish presence and Jewish history in Jerusalem. It would make no sense; it is absurd to deny this history.” France is one of Europe’s strongest advocates for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority and their Muslim allies at UNESCO should have understood from Valls’ statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic European support. Instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in October. The October 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the April resolution. It condemned Israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the Jewish (and Christian) nexus to the city. This time however, the Muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. While the resolution passed, the Muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58-member body. Of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution (Mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23), 14 were composed of states with Muslim majorities while a fifteenth, Nigeria, is 50 percent Muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. What was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western European concurrence. Other developing nations, like India, which had hitherto supported Arab-sponsored drafts also abstained. Israel’s behind-the-scenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the Muslim initiative was paying dividends. Following the resolution’s passage, the Palestinians and their Muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. Mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that his government’s changed position “reiterates the recognition that the Government of Mexico gives the undeniable link of the Jewish people to the cultural heritage of East Jerusalem.” Brazil soon followed suit echoing Mexico’s position. In a statement, the Brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such one-sided resolutions. Italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told an Italian radio station that these resolutions were “incomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong.” He added that “to say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness.” Even UNESCO’s director-general, Irina Bokova voiced disapproval by stating that “the heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.” She later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan introduced a third draft resolution to UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. The proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the Jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. The 21-member WHC body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, Croatia and Tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the Muslim bloc. Instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. The two nations opposing were Tanzania and the Philippines. Of the 10 ayes, seven were Muslim. It was a pyrrhic victory at best. Given the large number of Muslim countries represented at the U.N. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against Israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. But as evidenced by recent Arab political reversals, gone are the days that the Palestinians can rely on automatic European and non-aligned support. Israel has been effectively reaching out to the so-called non-aligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. Part of the Israeli success lies in the fact that the Jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counter-terrorism, cyber warfare and arms. This outreach has translated to political dividends at the U.N. Nevertheless, the UNESCO resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many U.N. member states. It also underscores the need for the United States to maintain its commitment and assurance to Israel that it will never allow the U.N. to impose terms and dictates on Israel. There have been rumors circulating that Barack Obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on Israel utilizing the UN Security Council. The White House has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. The administration’s objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed anti-Israel resolution, likely introduced by France, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. In addition to betraying long-standing commitments to Israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the United States would throw Israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant anti-Semitism to have a say on Israel’s fate, is beyond asinine. Hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at UNESCO steers the administration in the right direction.",1,1247,20.783333333333335,60,0.4033680834001604,0,0,0,0,95.11144806835597,17.17418899375595,55.092317562149155,35.58050432148267,0.7650360866078588,0.012830793905372895,0.038492381716118684,0.024057738572574178,0.05533279871692061,0.007217321571772253,0.14033680834001605,0.010425020048115477,0.0048115477145148355,0.012028869286287089,0.10665597433841219,0,0.060144346431435444,0.00801924619085806,0.00400962309542903,0.008821170809943865,0.014434643143544507,0.09703287890938252,0,0.04330392943063352,0.018444266238973536,0.05132317562149158,0.014434643143544507,0.00400962309542903,0.01764234161988773,0.015236567762630313,0.06094627105052125,0,0,0.0016038492381716118,0.0008019246190858059,0,0.010425020048115477,0.04490777866880513,0,0,0.4322373696872494,0.00400962309542903,0.0056134723336006415,0.0016038492381716118,0,0.05533279871692061,0.00400962309542903,0.0008019246190858059,0.03368083400160385,0.0048115477145148355,0.0024057738572574178,0.0032076984763432237,0.0032076984763432237,0.018444266238973536,0.007217321571772253,0.024859663191659984,0.00400962309542903,0,0.0272654370489174,0.18283881315156375,0,0.0032076984763432237,0.012830793905372895,0.05132317562149158,0.06495589414595028,0.0136327185244587,0.030473135525260625,0.040096230954290296,0.12750601443464316,0.06896551724137931,0.012028869286287089,0.0008019246190858059,0.014434643143544507,0.1210906174819567,0.03127506014434643,0.010425020048115477,0.007217321571772253,0.0056134723336006415,0.0048115477145148355,0.0008019246190858059,0,0.00400962309542903,0.03368083400160385,0.07217321571772253,0,0.012830793905372895,0.0056134723336006415,0.03127506014434643,0.09703287890938252,0.10184442662389735,0,0.024859663191659984,0.00400962309542903,31.875,0,106.8,12,6,8,10,55,18,84,16,28,62,6,31.875,10,147.875,28,259.8,426.675,147.875,,0.47920789374184225,0,0.7550850729585898,0.2572842744474721,0.14763410387308012,0.1876127897984334,0.22400923773979586,0.6135584173557451,0.34193868804200434,0.7080182109433548,0.31594942629453465,0.4469914717273348,0.641549545618227,0.14763410387308012,0.6001776330640741,0.22400923773979586,0.09432758703175084,0.017860844881751638,0.165723125009967,0.27217057106862075,-0.8204448332708214,0.7278294289313793,106
54,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump received an urgent warning in February, informing him of a crucial date he was about to miss. “FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near,” said a Twitter post directed at Mr. Trump the first lady, Melania Trump and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump. “Please reach out!” The message came from Wells Wood Turning  Finishing, the company that supplies commemorative wooden eggs for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the    celebration that has drawn 35, 000 people to the South Lawn in recent years. The staff of the company, based in Buckfield, Me. wondered whether the Trumps planned to continue distributing the wooden eggs as party favors, or whether they were even going to have a White House Easter Egg Roll at all. By early March, the White House announced that the roll was on  —   Monday, to be exact  —   and soon followed up with a rush order for the wooden eggs. By that time, the ovoid uncertainty had raised a question perhaps not as consequential as investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election, a legally dubious travel ban and a collapsed health care bill, but no less a window into the inner workings of the Trump administration: Could this White House, plagued by slow hiring and lacking an   first lady, manage to pull off the largest, most elaborate and most heavily scrutinized public event of the year? “It’s the single most   event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on,” said Melinda Bates, who organized eight years of Easter Egg Rolls as director of the White House Visitors Office under President Bill Clinton. “I’m really concerned for the Trump people, because they have failed to fill some really vital posts, and this thing is all hands on deck. ” White House party catastrophes have been the stuff of presidential nightmares in the past. During his first year in office, President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for lax security procedures after a pair of aspiring   celebrities successfully crashed a state dinner honoring the prime minister of India, with one of them managing to buttonhole Mr. Obama for a handshake. The late start in planning by the Trump White House points to a smaller and less ambitious Egg Roll than in previous years. There may be half as many guests, a fraction of the number of volunteers to manage the invasion of the South Lawn, and military bands in place of   entertainers like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Idina Menzel and Silentó who have performed for Egg Rolls past. White House officials did not respond to several weeks’ worth of inquiries about the Easter Egg Roll, typically a heavily and enthusiastically promoted affair, and declined to provide basic information such as how many people are expected to attend. It is unclear, for instance, whether Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, will reprise his appearance in a bunny suit for the event, as he did a decade ago when George W. Bush was president and Mr. Spicer was an aide in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Stephanie Grisham, who started as Mrs. Trump’s communications director on Monday, had previously denied that the event was being scaled back from past years. But she acknowledged on Tuesday that attendance this year would be “a bit less,” based on feedback from former officials who had said “the event had become so large that many children were not able to enjoy the planned activities. ” “Our team has been working very hard to make this year’s event a success,” Ms. Grisham said. “I am confident that the success of this year’s Easter Egg Roll will speak for itself. ” The evidence points to a quickly   affair that people close to the planning said would probably draw about 20, 000 people  —   substantially smaller than last year’s Easter Egg Roll, which drew 37, 000. It will be staffed by 500 volunteers, Ms. Grisham said, half the usual. Ms. Grisham said she did not have “firm numbers” on the overall number of attendees, and those who provided estimates did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the plans for the Easter Egg Roll, which are still evolving just a week before the event. The White House has ordered 40, 000 of the commemorative eggs  —   about half of the roughly 85, 000 ordered in 2016  —   with 18, 000 to be given away at the Easter Egg Roll and another 22, 000 available for sale, according to Lara Kline, the vice president for marketing and communications at the White House Historical Association, the official retailer. The relatively small number, Ms. Kline said, “is due to the limited manufacturing window for this year’s Easter Egg Roll. ” The employees at Wells Wood Turning were not alone in wondering whether the White House would ever get in touch.   public schools that normally receive blocks of tickets for as many as 4, 000 children have yet to hear from the White House, according to representatives for school systems in the District of Columbia Arlington, Va. and Alexandria, Va. Several groups representing military families, who have accounted for as many as 3, 000 guests in recent years, also said they had yet to be contacted. “I’ve had quite a few families from across the country reach out and say: ‘Hey, are we getting tickets? Our family wants to drive in for the event,’” said Ashley   the president of the American Military Partner Association, which represents the families of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and has received tickets for five to 10 of them for each of the last several years. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it. ” But Ms. Grisham said on Tuesday that tickets had been set aside for schools, children’s hospitals and military families. She could not say how many. Even Curious George and Elmo did not know for sure that the Easter Egg Roll was happening until late last month, when the White House first contacted PBS Kids to ask if it could provide costumed characters. “We just got word about this year’s Egg Roll and are working on planning,” Jennifer Rankin Byrne, the senior director of media relations for PBS, said on March 20. The Easter Egg Roll has been crowded in past years with cast members from “Sesame Street,” but this year, there will be a lone emissary. “PBS asked us to participate with them, and we agreed to provide a ‘Sesame Street’ character,” said Elizabeth Weinreb Fishman, the vice president for strategic communications for Sesame Workshop. She declined to say which character would attend, referring questions to the White House. Members of Congress have not received word from the White House about whether they will get tickets to distribute to their constituents. One aide to a Republican lawmaker said White House officials “seem to be a bit behind schedule. ” Nor have the organizers of the Yoga Garden featured on the South Lawn during   Easter Egg Rolls been asked to share their asanas. “No one has reached out to me about the 2017 event,” said Leah Cullis, the yogi who coordinated the Yoga Garden for all eight of the Obamas’ Easter Egg Rolls. Mrs. Trump, who lives in New York and has had a limited presence in Washington since her husband was sworn in, has been slow to hire a staff for the East Wing, which typically takes the lead on the Easter Egg Roll. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event. “You don’t understand what a beast this thing is to plan until you go and plan your first one,” said Ellie Schafer, who organized Easter Egg Rolls for the Obamas as the director of the White House Visitors Office from 2009 to 2016. “Every administration tries to put its own stamp on it, but the stakes are high because it’s such a Washington tradition, and people just love it and have very strong feelings about it. ” Ms. Bates, whose memoir “White House Story” documents the challenges of planning   Easter Egg Rolls, said the event was a window  —   up to a point  —   into the competence of an administration. “If you can pull off an Easter Egg Roll,” she said, “you can do anything. ”",0,1427,27.980392156862745,51,0.28381219341275404,0,0,0,0,95.44003120413588,30.081289418360196,77.9650888704848,42.28850196754892,0.8507358093903293,0.02452697967764541,0.049754730203223546,0.030133146461107218,0.023826208829712685,0.023826208829712685,0.1590749824807288,0.000700770847932726,0.000700770847932726,0.011913104414856343,0.09670637701471618,0,0.06587245970567625,0.02452697967764541,0.000700770847932726,0.008409250175192713,0.005606166783461808,0.06517168885774352,0.001401541695865452,0.06517168885774352,0.02102312543798178,0.049754730203223546,0,0.001401541695865452,0.020322354590049056,0.009810791871058164,0.1051156271899089,0.000700770847932726,0.004905395935529082,0.004204625087596356,0.01401541695865452,0,0.011913104414856343,0.050455501051156273,0.002803083391730904,0.002803083391730904,0.44498948843728103,0.00350385423966363,0.016818500350385426,0.021723896285914507,0.00350385423966363,0.039243167484232656,0.002803083391730904,0.018220042046250877,0.011913104414856343,0.018220042046250877,0.0161177295024527,0.006306937631394534,0.006306937631394534,0.025227750525578137,0.009810791871058164,0.00700770847932726,0.000700770847932726,0.000700770847932726,0.02943237561317449,0.22424667133847231,0.005606166783461808,0,0.036440084092501754,0.04064470918009811,0.0918009810791871,0.027330063069376315,0.0161177295024527,0.05466012613875263,0.15276804484933426,0.06657323055360898,0.019621583742116328,0.001401541695865452,0.0322354590049054,0.161177295024527,0.000700770847932726,0.008409250175192713,0.00350385423966363,0.002803083391730904,0.015416958654519973,0,0.001401541695865452,0.008409250175192713,0.10301331464611072,0.06937631394533987,0,0.0161177295024527,0.007708479327259986,0.07077785564120533,0.11702873160476523,0.11282410651716888,0.004204625087596356,0.0539593552908199,0.00350385423966363,23.5,0,27,1,0,22,7.73,11,2.83,48.375,4,6,23,0,23.5,0,69.818125,43.948750000000004,94.375,206.14187500000003,69.818125,,0.4239012567943381,0,0.45811288255756305,0.030360587679433386,0,0.4078799526073465,0.19487015610304734,0.2561866822010777,0.08139800037008194,0.6023350890035298,0.11130453723244073,0.15815511491062575,0.4186580314518948,0,0.4671537613118367,0,0.04449446293694762,0.02800814298579598,0.06014433844613318,0.1313723623620713,-0.5209343777415955,0.8686276376379287,64
55,"The Secret Service is investigating a burlesque dancer from Kentucky after she posted a Tweet that said she hoped someone would be “kind enough” to assassinate President Donald Trump. [“If someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to assassinate Trump,” Heather Lowrey, 26, of Louisville wrote on Twitter.  The Secret Service confirmed it interviewed Lowrey and is still investigating the incident, the New York Daily News reported. Lowrey posted the Tweet Jan. 17, three days before Trump’s inauguration. The Tweet disappeared not long after it was posted, along with all her social media accounts. The bio on her profile said she was a “a Louisville Vixen and aspiring WWE diva” before the account was taken down, the Daily News reported. No charges have been announced against her yet, but her former employers have already issued statements denouncing the Tweet and have severed ties with her, WAVE reported. Va Va Vixens, a burlesque group in Louisville, let Lowrey go as soon as they found out about the incident, citing a “zero tolerance policy” for her behavior. “We do not condone hate by any party and will not partake in it. We in no way support negative behavior or malicious intent from anyone,” the group said. American Income Life, Travis Moody Office, also severed ties with Lowrey and issued a statement on the company’s Facebook page saying, “Heather Lowrey is no longer contracted with the Travis Moody Agency. ” “The Travis Moody Agency, its agents and its staff do not share the same views, nor opinions as Heather Lowrey. We have a zero tolerance policy and would never condone this behavior,” the company said. She is the only person to face a federal investigation for posting about the assassination of President Trump. The Secret Service is also reportedly looking into Madonna’s comments at the Women’s March on Washington Saturday after the singer said she had thought of “blowing up the White House. ”",0,329,19.352941176470587,17,0.3556231003039514,0,0,0,0,87.91359982985811,7.03299227992066,81.09348558284728,30.92770299609205,0.790273556231003,0,0.057750759878419454,0.03343465045592705,0.04559270516717325,0.0425531914893617,0.17325227963525835,0.0060790273556231,0,0.0121580547112462,0.0972644376899696,0,0.0729483282674772,0.00911854103343465,0.00303951367781155,0.00303951367781155,0.0060790273556231,0.0851063829787234,0,0.060790273556231005,0.03343465045592705,0.0486322188449848,0,0.0121580547112462,0.02735562310030395,0.0121580547112462,0.06990881458966565,0,0,0,0.0364741641337386,0,0.00911854103343465,0.06382978723404255,0,0,0.45592705167173253,0.0060790273556231,0.0182370820668693,0.00303951367781155,0,0.03343465045592705,0.00303951367781155,0,0.02127659574468085,0,0.0121580547112462,0,0.0182370820668693,0.015197568389057751,0.030395136778115502,0.02127659574468085,0.00303951367781155,0,0.015197568389057751,0.21580547112462006,0.00303951367781155,0,0.030395136778115502,0.0486322188449848,0.1094224924012158,0.04559270516717325,0.0243161094224924,0.0243161094224924,0.12158054711246201,0.0790273556231003,0.0121580547112462,0,0.0486322188449848,0.11854103343465046,0,0.00303951367781155,0,0,0.0121580547112462,0,0,0.03343465045592705,0.13677811550151975,0.04559270516717325,0,0.02735562310030395,0.00303951367781155,0.057750759878419454,0.12462006079027356,0.13069908814589665,0.00911854103343465,0.07598784194528875,0,0,0,37,0,0,3,5,10,1.83,10,0,1,0,0,0,0,2.83,8,51,61.83,2.83,,0,0,0.6673991352384124,0,0,0.13993131946754478,0.21331887166009167,0.3516287047744073,0.09028526184436045,0.3516287047744073,0,0.05144274016101998,0,0,0.3736528678559065,0,0.007735833583905093,0.021868080802558566,0.13940901511631085,0.16901292950277452,-0.7869834240772634,0.8309870704972255,25
56,"Tweet Widget by Nathan J. Robinson Bill and Hillary Clinton’s role in the “remaking” of Haiti after a devastating earthquake and foreign occupation is “indefensible,” according to the author’s article, “Superpredator: Bill Clinton’s Use and Abuse of Black America,” from which this piece is excerpted. “Many Clinton projects “have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island’s ruling elite.” Other projects simply fizzled. “The money donated and invested was extraordinary, but nobody seems to know where it has gone.” What the Clintons Did to Haiti by Nathan J. Robinson This article previously appeared in Global Research and Current Affairs . “She intended to ‘make Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.’” Bill and Hillary Clinton had long shared a personal interest in Haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in Port-au-Prince. In his autobiography, Bill says that his understanding of God and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. Hillary Clinton says the two of them “fell in love” with Haiti and they had developed a “deep connection” to the country. So when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of Haiti one of her top priorities. The country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the United States could “road-test new approaches to development,” taking advantage of what she termed “the power of proximity.” She intended to “make Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.” Hillary Clinton selected her own chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to run the Haiti project. Mills would be joined by Bill Clinton, who had been deputized by the U.N. as a “special envoy” to Haiti. Bill’s role was not well-defined, and Haitians were curious about what was in store. Mills wrote in an email to Hillary Clinton that Haitians saw Bill’s appointment as “a step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.” Soon, “joking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,” the Haitian media “ dubbed him Le Gouverneur.” The project was heavily focused on increasing Haiti’s appeal to foreign corporations. As Politico reported , Clinton’s experiment “had business at its center: Aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the United States.” “Clinton announced that Haiti would be a laboratory where the United States could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of ‘the power of proximity.’” One of the first acts in the new “business-centered” Haiti policy involved suppressing Haiti’s minimum wage. A 2009 Haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for Hanes and Levi Strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. The manufacturers approached the U.S. State Department, who brought intense pressure to bear against Haitian President René Préval, working to “aggressively block” the 37-cent increase. The U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase “did not take economic reality into account” and simply “appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.” But as Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the American garment manufacturers: “As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. Or better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.” “U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase ‘did not take economic reality into account” and simply ‘appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.’” The truth of the “economic reality” was that the Haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. The effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a Clinton project. It was also a “concerted effort on the part of Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, and American companies.” But it was in keeping with the State Department’s priorities under Clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. It was that same familiar Clinton move “from aid to trade.” Bill Clinton’s program for Haitian development, designed by Oxford University economist Paul Collier, “ had garment exports at its center.” Collier wrote that because of “propitious” factors like “poverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with China.” But the Clintons’ role in Haiti would soon expand even further. In 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. The disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (The consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the Haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed Haitian farmers in Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton was soon put in charge of the U.S.-led recovery effort. He was appointed to head the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. At President Obama’s request, Clinton and George W. Bush created the “Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund,” and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support Haiti in the earthquake’s aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State overseeing the efforts of USAID, the Clintons’ importance to the recovery could not be overstated; Bill’s appointment meant that “at every stage of Haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight and allocation—a Clinton was now involved.” Despite appearances, the Clinton-Bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. As they wrote , “[w]hile other organizations in Haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.” While the fund would advertise that “100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,” Clinton and Bush adopted an expansive definition of “relief” efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. On their website, they spoke proudly of what the New York Daily News characterized as a program of “supporting longterm programs to develop Haiti’s business class.” “At every stage of Haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight and allocation—a Clinton was now involved.” The strategy was an odd one. Port-au-Prince had been reduced to ruin, and Haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, Haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. The Clinton-led recovery was a disaster. A year after the earthquake, a stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton’s IHRC as creating a “quagmire of indecision and delay” that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: “…less than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. And while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.” Instead, the Clinton Foundation, IHRC, and State Department created what a Wall Street Journal writer called “a mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.” Haitian IHRC members lamented that the commission had produced “a disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of Haiti.” A 2013 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. Many Clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. For example, The Washington Post reported that : “…[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.” “ A stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton’s IHRC as creating a ‘quagmire of indecision and delay.’” Other Clinton ventures were seen as “disconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.” Politico reported that many Clinton projects “have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island’s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.” For example, “the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis Hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men’s dress shirts.” Predictably, the Royal Oasis didn’t do an especially roaring trade; The Washington Post reported that “[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.” In a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. Sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. For instance, Bill Clinton had proudly announced that the Clinton Foundation would be funding the “construction of emergency storm shelters in Léogâne.” But an investigation of the shelters that the Foundation had actually built found that they were “shoddy and dangerous” and full of toxic mold. The Nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. The Clinton Foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to Clayton Homes, a firm that had already been sued in the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for “having provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to Hurricane Katrina victims.” (Clayton Homes was owned by Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the Clinton Foundation.) The Nation ’s investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in Clinton Foundation trailers. Their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. The misery of the students in the Clinton trailers was described: “Judith Seide, a student in Lubert’s sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, she said, her ‘head hurts and I feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise I’d fall.’ Her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate Judel, who sometimes can’t open his eyes because, said Seide, ‘he’s allergic to the heat.’ Their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. Sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. ‘At noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,’ the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. She is worried because ‘the kids feel sick, can’t work, can’t advance to succeed.’” “Three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.” The most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the Caracol industrial park . The park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping Haiti “build back better” than it was before. The State Department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for Haitians, with Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. The industrial park followed the Clintons’ preexisting development model for Haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. Even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on “the more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.” Much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a South Korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with U.S. taxpayer funding. The Caracol project was “the centerpiece” of the U.S.’s recovery effort. A gala celebrating its opening featured the Clintons and Sean Penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, “better” Haiti, that would demonstrate the country’s commitment to being “open for business.” In order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. But the project was a terrible disappointment. After four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : Far from 100,000 jobs—or even the 60,000 promised within five years of the park’s opening— “Caracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [Caracol] worker makes per year. The park, built on the site of a former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.” Most of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, “ surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.” Huge queues of unemployed Haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. The Washington Post described the scene: “Each morning, crowds line up outside the park’s big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding résumés in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. From his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the U.S. Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machine. ‘I have three kids and a wife, and I can’t support them,’ he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. ‘I have a diploma, but I still can’t get a job here. I still have nothing.’” “ The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.” For some , the Caracol project perfectly symbolized the Clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on Haitians. “Caracol is a prime example of bad help,” as one Haiti scholar put it . “The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.” But, failure as it may have been, the Caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. As Politico explained : “Even Bill’s U.N. Office of the Special Envoy couldn’t track where all of [it] went—and the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent ‘rebuilding’ Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. A whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the Pentagon, which spent it on deployment of U.S. troops—20,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on Haitian soil. That money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gym… Huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, a Kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with Washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government during the Iraq War.” The recovery under the Clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. Clinton staffers “ had no idea what Haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the Haitians.” They were reportedly rude and condescending toward Haitians, even refusing to admit Haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. While the Clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to Haitians themselves. The former Haitian prime minister spoke of a “weak” American staff who were “more interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.” “A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.” One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while Haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. “The incompetence is mind numbing,” she wrote . Chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. But the memo was kept within the Clinton family, released only later under a Freedom of Information Act disclosure of Hillary’s State Department correspondence. If it had come out at the time, as Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , it “would have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her mother’s State Department was working so hard to promote.” The Clintons’ Haiti recovery ended with a whimper. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. The IHRC “ quietly closed their doors” in October of 2011, even though little progress had been made. As the Boston Review ’s Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the IHRC wiped its hands of the housing situation: “[L]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. Instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. These subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. As efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned Haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.” The Clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about Haiti. After the first two years, they were “nowhere to be seen” there, despite Hillary’s having promised that her commitment to Haiti would long outlast her tenure as Secretary of State. Haiti has been given little attention during Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, even though the Haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both Clintons. “One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton.” The widespread consensus among observers is that the Haiti recovery, which TIME called the U.S.’s “compassionate invasion,” was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes that “it’s hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the U.S.-led response to the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake as a success.” While plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were “little more than small pilot projects—a new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.” The end result has been that little has changed for Haiti. “Haitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,” reports a Belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in Haiti: “Everyone says that they’re living in worse conditions than before… When you look at the history of humanitarian relief, there’s never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of time… On paper, with that much money in a territory the size of Haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.” “If anything, they appear worse off,” says Foreign Policy of Haiti’s farmers. “I really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former U.S. president in charge, and get this outcome,” said one Haitian official. Indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. But nobody seems to know where it has gone. Haitians direct much of the blame toward the Clintons. As a former Haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , “[t]here is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . .. They say that Clinton used Haiti.” Haitians “ increasingly complain that Clinton-backed projects have often helped the country’s elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor ‘Haitians.” There is a “suspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.” And that while “striking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti.” But perhaps we should be more forgiving of the Clintons’ conduct during the Haitian recovery. After all, instead of doing true harm, the Clintons simply failed to do much good. And perhaps it’s better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. Thanks to Bill Clinton, there’s a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. Yet it’s a mistake to measure Clinton against what would have happened if the United States had done nothing at all for Haiti. The question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. Tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the Haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. The squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of Haitians’ own demands, mean that Clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. Plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the world’s donations had been used effectively. “Defending the Clintons’ Haiti record is an impossible endeavor.” Democrats have bristled at recent attempts by Donald Trump to criticize Hillary Clinton over her record in Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting from Haiti was stingingly critical of the Clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. When Trump accused the Clintons of squandering millions building “a sweatshop” in Haiti in the form of the Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing Pinocchios. The Washington Post said that while Clinton Foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited “writ large” rather than “directly.” The Post cited the words of the factory’s spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that Caracol workers earned at least “minimum wage” (failing to mention that minimum wage in Haiti remains well under a dollar). PolitiFact also rated the sweatshop claim “mostly false,” even though Katz notes “long hours, tough conditions, and low pay” at the factory and PolitiFact acknowledges the “ongoing theft of legally-earned wages.” Defending the Clintons’ Haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one Democrats should probably not bother attempting. As the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the Clinton-led recovery mission, “it’s hard to say it’s been anything other than a failure.” Haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the Clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the Clintons when they became inconvenient. None of this means that one should vote for Donald Trump for president. His tears for Haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the country’s wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. As we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that Hillary Clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. It is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. It remains simultaneously true that a Clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the Clintons did to Haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible.",1,4326,22.298969072164947,194,0.35298196948682387,0,0,0,0,94.24816355884317,13.904922712014312,59.77366620434582,27.693003544459852,0.7801664355062413,0.027045769764216365,0.049699491447064266,0.030975496994914472,0.04022191400832178,0.00785945446139621,0.20388349514563106,0.003236245954692557,0.0020804438280166435,0.01756819232547388,0.09685621821544152,0.0004623208506703652,0.06957928802588997,0.009477577438742488,0.003929727230698105,0.014331946370781322,0.009246417013407305,0.08090614886731391,0.003005085529357374,0.056865464632454926,0.028663892741562644,0.044382801664355064,0.011095700416088766,0.0013869625520110957,0.024271844660194174,0.011789181692094313,0.07119741100323625,0,0.001155802126675913,0.003005085529357374,0.007397133610725843,0,0.004623208506703652,0.06171983356449376,0.0016181229773462784,0.0016181229773462784,0.44521497919556174,0.004623208506703652,0.0062413314840499305,0.004160887656033287,0.0018492834026814608,0.043689320388349516,0.005779010633379565,0.0006934812760055479,0.013407304669440592,0.013638465094775775,0.0034674063800277394,0.005547850208044383,0.03421174294960703,0.015487748497457236,0.010402219140083218,0.019186315302820157,0.004623208506703652,0.0006934812760055479,0.02473416551086454,0.21867776236708275,0.011789181692094313,0.0020804438280166435,0.01410078594544614,0.053629218677762366,0.10124826629680998,0.028663892741562644,0.02034211742949607,0.03398058252427184,0.1421636615811373,0.07235321312991216,0.02034211742949607,0,0.046463245492371706,0.12829403606102635,0.0006934812760055479,0.009708737864077669,0.007397133610725843,0.005779010633379565,0.004160887656033287,0.0013869625520110957,0,0.011095700416088766,0.054785020804438284,0.07374017568192326,0,0.014794267221451687,0.009246417013407305,0.038372630605640314,0.11049468331021729,0.11673601479426722,0.0016181229773462784,0.07212205270457697,0.0048543689320388345,148.7,2,184.5,39.775,8,74.325,38.1,106,12.23,203.2875,119.475,48,65.5,18,148.7,20,377.135,146.425,610.6125,1107.5724999999998,377.135,,0.7047739204853749,0.03110920846728057,0.7476002457284238,0.38970399207834255,0.1138147715085739,0.5440485494855559,0.3795212107467785,0.6298664386872603,0.16411779517076816,0.7654555486211132,0.6573060417574087,0.4352176449621243,0.5125610880484376,0.224188309384875,0.7942128287810138,0.24304394258384912,0.07327886666320158,0.028450973924879133,0.11864449592422917,0.21520584816399646,-0.8412908406598172,0.7847941518360035,287
57,"It might be hard to remember now, with one governor embroiled in a corruption scandal for the last three years and his counterpart across the Hudson River plunging headlong into another, but Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York were once lionized for relentlessly prosecuting bad behavior in government. The wars they waged against corrupt politicians, as the attorney general of New York (Mr. Cuomo) and the United States attorney for New Jersey (Mr. Christie) won them bipartisan kudos and, eventually, smooth ascents to their states’ highest offices. After the ethical morasses that swamped figures such as former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York and Alan Hevesi, the state’s former comptroller, and former Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey in the 2000s, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie  —   each a tough prosecutor with    White House aspirations  —   looked more immaculate than ever. Those were the days. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, spent Thursday reeling at the arrest of one of his closest friends, confidants and former aides, as well as the arrests of several other close advisers and donors. Prosecutors had accused them of involvement in a   bribery scheme whose many grubby details included the fact that two of the governor’s former aides referred gleefully to corrupt payoffs as “ziti,” à la “The Sopranos,” and to one skittish ziti contributor as “fat boy. ” (As in: “Handle fat boy carefully. We don’t need an interruption in that Zitti delivery or else well really be up the creek. ”) Over in New Jersey, Mr. Christie, a Republican, is up a very unpleasant creek of his own. A former top aide and a former political ally are on trial over their roles in the 2013 scandal that elevated a traffic jam on access lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge into an immortal symbol of political payback. Having helped puncture Mr. Christie’s presidential hopes earlier this year, the   episode later went on to help sink his bid to join the Donald J. Trump ticket. The trial, which began last Monday, has been no kinder to the governor: Prosecutors waited exactly zero days before asserting, during opening statements, that Mr. Christie knew three of his aides and allies were involved in the plot as it was unfolding. Neither governor is accused of breaking the law. But for two men who once prided themselves on managing    administrations, claiming to have been blind to alleged acts of petty revenge and bribery at the highest levels of state government seems bad enough. As they campaigned for the governor’s office, each promised to cut through what they called partisan nonsense, bureaucratic inertia and dodgy dealing to get real results for residents in their states. Each had the trophy case to back it up. As state attorney general, Mr. Cuomo took aim at the other two statewide elected officials, both fellow Democrats: Mr. Spitzer, whose administration’s misuse of state troopers to target a political rival Mr. Cuomo helped uncover, and Mr. Hevesi, who went to prison after a Cuomo investigation found that he had accepted personal benefits in exchange for approving a state pension fund investment. In New Jersey, where Mr. Christie was appointed a United States attorney by President George W. Bush in 2002, the young prosecutor quickly dispelled questions about his readiness for the job by pursuing corruption charges against dozens of local officials and leading   inquiries that implicated several more. They were sane. Smart. Clean. Capable. Determined. And smug. “I am putting each and every one of you on notice,” Mr. Christie said in a 2002 speech, taking aim at his home state’s notoriously debased political culture. “We are going to root this stuff out, and I expect all of you to help me. ” By 2009, as a virtual political neophyte and a Republican in a blue state, he had managed to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Jon S. Corzine. “Job 1 is going to be to clean up Albany and make the government work for the people,” Mr. Cuomo said in 2010, kicking off his campaign for governor on the steps of Manhattan’s Tweed Courthouse, New York’s monument to   political corruption. (He also vowed to run the “most transparent” administration in state history.) But as the fallout from each scandal has made clear, the professionalism and integrity of their offices were compromised almost from the start by aides and advisers who seemed far more interested in their own endgames  —   whether political, financial or both  —   than in serving a state. In both cases, they were empowered by Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo themselves. Each man had cultivated a small group of trusted advisers who, driven by unshakable tribal loyalty and a hunger to see their bosses taste the White House one day, enforced the governor’s will, punished his enemies and rewarded his friends. For Mr. Christie, they included Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, the two former officials currently on trial, and Bill Stepien, his former top lieutenant, an old friend and political operative who left ears ringing across New Jersey on the governor’s behalf. They met for strategy sessions around Mr. Christie’s kitchen table in Mendham and mingled at N. F. L. games. They worked together to single out local officials who supported the governor’s 2013   bid for perks and to mete out revenge to those who did not  —   including Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, N. J. a Democrat who, having declined to endorse the governor, got a catastrophic traffic jam in return, prosecutors say. Their equivalents in Albany were a group of stalwarts who had marched at Mr. Cuomo’s side, in some cases as far back as the administration of Mr. Cuomo’s father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who became governor in 1983. The men, and they were all men, even had a “term of endearment” for one another, according to the federal criminal complaint released on Thursday: “Herb. ” (It remains unclear why.) Chief among them was Joseph Percoco, who had started working for the elder Mr. Cuomo when he was 19. So high was his place in the family firmament that during Mr. Cuomo’s eulogy for his father in January 2015, he called Mr. Percoco “my father’s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most. ” It was Mr. Percoco who, everyone in New York’s political establishment understood, woke Mr. Cuomo up in the morning, dispensed threats for him during the day and put him to bed at night. It was also Mr. Percoco, working with another “Herb” and former Cuomo aide, Todd R. Howe, who shook down a developer and an energy company for at least $315, 000 in bribes in exchange for putting his considerable power at their service, prosecutors say. There was the legal opinion that Mr. Percoco got reversed. The energy policy decisions, made by state experts, that he overrode. The $5, 700 raise, the criminal complaint says, that he berated   staff at the governor’s office into approving for the son of an executive who had paid him off. And there was the fact, apparent from the complaint, that no one in state government questioned his authority to do so. These days, there is no avoiding the central question: How could the governors not have known? Mr. Christie has said that while he took ultimate responsibility for the lane closings, it was impossible for him to keep tabs on 65, 000 state employees. He was “disturbed,” he said, by Mr. Stepien’s behavior, while Ms. Kelly was “stupid” and “a liar. ” Mr. Cuomo, too, has been moved to muse on personal betrayal. “The central plank of my administration has always been about public integrity and zero tolerance for any waste, fraud or abuse. If anything, I hold a friend to a higher standard,” he said in Buffalo on Friday. “It’s the first time since we lost my father that I didn’t miss him being here yesterday, because it would’ve broken his heart. ”",0,1339,19.12857142857143,70,0.3188946975354742,0,0,0,0,93.86631409637431,15.901596785091932,84.69408584942565,21.195141237973907,0.7692307692307693,0.01344286781179985,0.07393577296489919,0.020911127707244213,0.03659447348767737,0.018670649738610903,0.20014936519790888,0.008215085884988798,0.002987303958177745,0.017923823749066467,0.07244212098581031,0,0.04630321135175504,0.0074682598954443615,0.002987303958177745,0.009708737864077669,0.008961911874533234,0.060492905153099324,0.0037341299477221808,0.06870799103808813,0.03435399551904406,0.05153099327856609,0,0.0014936519790888724,0.014936519790888723,0.005227781926811053,0.11949215832710978,0,0.005227781926811053,0.0014936519790888724,0.0007468259895444362,0,0.004480955937266617,0.070201643017177,0.005227781926811053,0.005227781926811053,0.42195668409260645,0.002987303958177745,0.008215085884988798,0.005227781926811053,0.006721433905899925,0.041075429424943986,0.0022404779686333084,0.0037341299477221808,0.014936519790888723,0.017923823749066467,0.0022404779686333084,0.05750560119492158,0.009708737864077669,0.01344286781179985,0.00597460791635549,0.018670649738610903,0.0007468259895444362,0.0014936519790888724,0.028379387602688575,0.23076923076923078,0.005227781926811053,0.0037341299477221808,0.01568334578043316,0.07468259895444361,0.07094846900672143,0.05153099327856609,0.01568334578043316,0.08364451082897685,0.15160567587752055,0.09260642270351008,0.021657953696788648,0.0007468259895444362,0.02539208364451083,0.14339058999253174,0.0007468259895444362,0.0074682598954443615,0.004480955937266617,0.0014936519790888724,0.005227781926811053,0,0,0.024645257654966394,0.1262135922330097,0.07617625093353249,0,0.014936519790888723,0.016430171769977596,0.05601194921583271,0.10380881254667662,0.09559372666168783,0.0022404779686333084,0.05750560119492158,0.0014936519790888724,25.625,0,112,6,10,11.375,13,86.25,18,76,25,7,60.4,0,25.625,0,134.025,24.375,230.25,381.025,134.025,,0.40647779596621414,0,0.7495821721835234,0.13819607273199155,0.21089672205953394,0.23313451684986647,0.2578517142815698,0.6974398764555716,0.32481257399564073,0.670096066282405,0.40053464089481977,0.157598828330256,0.6174822692284088,0,0.3367804653388343,0,0.08273020478079042,0.015046064103949012,0.14212743630499527,0.23519698770080705,-0.7843416112059574,0.7648030122991929,100
58,"Think the world is your oyster? Think again! From top secret HQ's to secretive underground train networks – we run through the Top 10 places you won't be entering anytime soon for love nor money. 10. Bohemian Grove Like something out of a cult thriller film, Bohemian Grove is a 2,700 acre rural location somewhere in Monte Rio, California. The land is owned by private San-Fran based arts club known – surprisingly – as the Bohemian Club. Every summer, the club host a two-week, three weekend camp in the woods for the most powerful men in the world. It all looks a bit weird. 9. Vatican Secret Archive This isn't just any old library, this is a Vatican library! Only a sacred few have access to the vaults – but feat not, if you need to read one of the books (which by the way are owned by the Pope) you can receive the manuscript via email – how very modern! 8. Lascaux Caves – France Found in South West France, Lascaux is complex of caves that are world-renowned for its Palaeolithic cave paintings that are estimated to be over 17,500 years old. Although these caves were once open to the public, they have since been closed to preserve the original artwork. 7. Pine Gap – Australia Known as Australia's equivalent of Area 51. Located in central Australia, and run the by the government and the CIA, it's the only place in the land down under designated as a no fly zone and is used as a monitoring station. What they're monitoring, we don't know. But according to recent news, Pine Gap operate a number of drone strike programmes. 6. Moscow Metro-2 Metro-2 is a secret underground tube system which runs parallel with the public metro system in Moscow. The system was built during the reign of Stalin and was code-named, D-6 by the Russian intelligence organisation – the KGB. When quizzed on this secret underground system, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) would not confirm or deny its existence. It's rumoured that the underground system dwarfs the public Metro with 4 lines that run between 50-200m deep allowing the Kremlin to connect directly with FSB HQ, the government airport and an underground town at Ramenki. 5. Room 39 North Korea Based in North Korea, Room 39, also known as Bureau 39 is a secretive organisation thats sole purpose is to find ways to obtain foreign currency for Kim Jong-un. Established in 1970, the organisation has been described as the kingpin of North Korea's so-called, ‘court economy’. Although very little has been published on Room 39, it's believed that the organisation has over 20 bank accounts in Switzerland and China and are used solely for the purpose of money laundering and other illegal transactions. It has also been reported that the organisation is involved in drug smuggling and illicit weapon sales. What is known, is that the secretive group have over 130 trading companies under its jurisdiction which are controlled by Kim Jong-un. If you ever fancy popping over to North Korean and attempting to enter the organisations HQ, you need to head towards the Workers Party building in Pyongyang. 4. Mezghorye, Russia This place has been reported as Russia's secret nuclear missile site. There are two battalions permanently stationed here to ward off visitors. The base contains automatic ballistic missiles which can be remotely activated in the event of a nuclear strike which is detected by seismic, light and pressure sensors. 3. Disney Club 33 Exclusive Club Located at Disneyland, Florida, this fairly unobtrusive looking front door is actually the entrance to a highly exclusive members only club. How do I get in? I hear you cry. Well firstly, you need to locate it. Without giving too much away, head to New Orleans Square and look for the Blue Bayou. Getting in won't be as easy – the club is not open to the public. However, members, which include Presidents of the United States, business leaders and actors – can bring friends and associates along, so you better start networking! 2. Area 51 Probably the worst kept secret, Area 51 is the alias for a military base that is located in Nevada – around 80 miles north-west of downtown Las Vegas. In the centre of the base is a large military airfield. According to insiders, the base's main purpose is research and development of experimental aircrafts and weaponry. What's bizarre is that the U.S Government doesn't acknowledge it's existence – adding fuel to conspiracy theories that the base is used for analysis of UFO's and aliens or is that what they want you to think? 1. Google Data Center Home of big brother. this is as heavily guarded as Area 51, Google's first data center is a high security location with trillions of records of OUR DATA.

61,"Comments Tensions are mounting as the most viciously divisive election in our nation’s history draws closer, and it is truly bringing out the worst in the American people. An African-American church in Mississippi, the Hopewell M.B. Church in Greeneville , has been set ablaze, causing heavy damage to the building – and in case there was any mystery as to who was responsible, “VOTE TRUMP” was spray-painted on the side. For all their talk about “religious freedom,” conservative Trump fans sure does have a fondness for attacking religious institutions. Mosques have been torched around the country in response to terrorist attacks , collectively punishing members of an entire religion for crimes committed by mentally disturbed individuals. Black churches have also been torched throughout the South as white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out of the wood-work, emboldened by Trump’s racial dogwhistles and ethno-nationalist rabble-rousing. The worst of these targeted attacks came last summer when a white supremacist walked into the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C, and murdered nine peaceful worshippers. This is the second act of domestic terrorism committed in the United States today, coming just hours before a white man murdered two police officers in Iowa, and as Trump continues to rile up his base and perpetuate the delusions of a conspiracy against him, it’s not likely to be the last.",1,230,28.75,8,0.3826086956521739,0,0,0,0,97.11072415897749,14.994729907773388,65.23349436392914,2.5760241266649913,0.7565217391304347,0.004347826086956522,0.06086956521739131,0.030434782608695653,0.09565217391304348,0.02608695652173913,0.1608695652173913,0.030434782608695653,0.017391304347826087,0.013043478260869565,0.09130434782608696,0,0.06956521739130435,0,0,0.008695652173913044,0.02608695652173913,0.06086956521739131,0,0.05652173913043478,0.0391304347826087,0.05652173913043478,0.02608695652173913,0.008695652173913044,0.008695652173913044,0,0.08260869565217391,0,0,0.004347826086956522,0,0,0.004347826086956522,0.034782608695652174,0,0,0.41739130434782606,0,0,0.004347826086956522,0,0.021739130434782608,0.004347826086956522,0,0,0.008695652173913044,0,0.013043478260869565,0,0.021739130434782608,0.004347826086956522,0.06086956521739131,0.004347826086956522,0,0.013043478260869565,0.18695652173913044,0.004347826086956522,0,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.06956521739130435,0.017391304347826087,0.034782608695652174,0.043478260869565216,0.16521739130434782,0.0391304347826087,0.017391304347826087,0,0.017391304347826087,0.14782608695652175,0.0391304347826087,0,0.008695652173913044,0,0.017391304347826087,0,0,0.008695652173913044,0.04782608695652174,0.08695652173913043,0,0.017391304347826087,0.004347826086956522,0.0391304347826087,0.10434782608695652,0.09130434782608696,0.004347826086956522,0.017391304347826087,0,0,0,68.05,0,13,0,0,18,0,71,6,4,13,0,0,0,36,0,127.05,162.05,36,,0,0,0.8432558854707107,0,0.5068401856938083,0,0,0.5872927345602237,0,0.8487836804982956,0.3217311600325895,0.2402530733520421,0.5068401856938083,0,0.6640263096412087,0,0.09888751545117429,0,0.34899052327976926,0.4451311633017443,-0.9105521572470717,0.5548688366982557,28
62,"The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings, how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Decker’s chief executive, James M. Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. “We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears,” Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman, valued at more than $775 million, was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears, selling one of its classic brands  —   one it created nearly a century ago  —   is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S. Lampert, the chairman and chief executive of Sears, has struggled for years to find  ways to help the company, as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes. These have been tough times for retailers. Macy’s and Kohl’s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected. Macy’s also announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close 100 stores. Sears also suffered during the season, with   sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent. Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert, who is also a hedge fund manager, Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers, as analysts said, pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September, analysts at Moody’s estimated that the company’s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1. 5 billion. As of Oct. 29, Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand, compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt, the company said. Its market value Thursday morning, by comparison, was $1. 2 billion, even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday, before ending up 0. 3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled. Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy. But on Thursday, the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position, including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampert’s hedge fund. “We are taking strong, decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment,” Mr. Lampert, the company’s biggest shareholder, said in a statement. Stanley Black  Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today, only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores. “Craftsman is a legendary American brand,” Mr. Loree said in a statement. “This agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market. ” Reaching the deal took months, as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring, Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its   brands, including Craftsman, DieHard and Kenmore, to raise money. Stanley Black  Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid, Stanley Black  Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brands’ tool business, a deal announced in October. By late fall, however, Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black  Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman. Under the deal, Stanley Black  Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes, which is expected to occur by   and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million. “We literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each other’s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties,” Mr. Loree told analysts.",0,733,18.325,40,0.3383356070941337,0,0,0,0,96.66532839602417,27.022540548734277,65.3938658986408,45.83471508028125,0.7967257844474761,0.010914051841746248,0.0504774897680764,0.02455661664392906,0.03137789904502047,0.010914051841746248,0.17053206002728513,0,0.002728512960436562,0.013642564802182811,0.0723055934515689,0,0.05593451568894952,0.005457025920873124,0.002728512960436562,0.009549795361527967,0,0.0723055934515689,0.001364256480218281,0.061391541609822645,0.040927694406548434,0.047748976807639835,0,0,0.013642564802182811,0.01637107776261937,0.08458390177353342,0,0,0.002728512960436562,0,0,0.01637107776261937,0.045020463847203276,0,0,0.4038199181446112,0.002728512960436562,0.008185538881309686,0,0,0.0504774897680764,0,0,0.023192360163710776,0.008185538881309686,0.002728512960436562,0.010914051841746248,0.06821282401091405,0.021828103683492497,0.002728512960436562,0.009549795361527967,0,0,0.054570259208731244,0.23192360163710776,0.01637107776261937,0,0.021828103683492497,0.06275579809004093,0.10914051841746249,0.008185538881309686,0.020463847203274217,0.04911323328785812,0.165075034106412,0.058663028649386086,0.0286493860845839,0.001364256480218281,0.013642564802182811,0.15416098226466576,0,0.008185538881309686,0.008185538881309686,0.001364256480218281,0.010914051841746248,0,0,0.001364256480218281,0.0504774897680764,0.06548431105047749,0,0.013642564802182811,0.001364256480218281,0.06684856753069578,0.10641200545702592,0.09686221009549795,0.005457025920873124,0.061391541609822645,0,37.125,0,23,3,4.75,6,2,0,4,27,7,15,35.625,0,37.125,0,78.375,8,57,140.375,78.375,,0.5675800890602427,0,0.4484805855779473,0.09589483406117029,0.14379006470030584,0.1750073658177636,0.06604088253131131,0,0.12389934309929541,0.4883848405841032,0.19838868006955165,0.34654620645552786,0.5574308594766649,0,0.3310923799080573,0,0.09415828202432798,0.00961105271061721,0.06847875056314762,0.16864394053161136,0.5166163141993958,0.8313560594683886,41
63,"TOKYO  —   The chief executive of Takata said on Tuesday that he would step down, as the embattled car parts supplier looks to attract   financial support to deal with the fallout from the largest automotive safety recall in history. The decision by the chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, reflects the financial pressure on Takata, which lost nearly $130 million last year. The company is in danger of buckling under the cost of the recall without a lifeline. His departure is the inevitable price of a cash infusion from new investors, who would most likely want a clean management slate. And any financial rescue would most likely mean shrinking the influence of the Takada family, which founded company in the 1930s and remains the largest shareholder. The resignation of Mr. Takada, the grandson of the founder, has been assumed for a while but never publicly discussed. In the more than two years after Takata was engulfed in a crisis over dangerously defective airbags, automakers have recalled 60 million vehicles in the United States and tens of millions more worldwide to fix the problem. The faulty equipment has been linked to 14 deaths and more than 100 injuries. Mr. Takada has been criticized for his leadership during the crisis. He has stayed largely in the background as the company’s reputation and cash reserves have plummeted, leaving it to subordinates to explain Takata’s response to regulators, politicians and the news media. The company did not make any public statements until nearly a year after the defect came to light. Mr. Takada did not say when he would resign or what role, if any, he would retain inside the company, which is publicly traded but has been controlled by his family for more than 80 years. “I don’t intend to hold on to my position,” he said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. “Once I’ve delivered this company to a place where it’s not at risk of faltering, I want to pass the baton. ” Mr. Takada has rarely addressed the crisis in public, but shareholder meetings, where investors can grill executives on a range of issues, have been an unavoidable exception. At Takata’s annual meeting last year, Mr. Takada apologized to victims but defended his company’s airbags as fundamentally safe. The meeting on Tuesday was the first time Mr. Takada had said publicly that he would resign. Takata has been seeking emergency capital to keep it from falling into bankruptcy because of mounting recall costs. Once a rescuer is found, the company will probably be drastically restructured, including changes in its top management. “Nobody wants to see anybody from the Takada family in charge at this point,” said Koji Endo, an auto industry analyst at Advanced Research Japan. “The Takada family, practically speaking, is being kicked out. ” Until 2014, Mr. Takada served in a more ceremonial role as Takata’s chairman. But he took over responsibility for    operations that year as the company’s problems escalated, and its board named him to succeed a Swiss executive, Stefan Stocker, who was then its president. Few seem to believe that Takata can weather the recall crisis on its own. The company lost 13 billion yen last year, or about $127 million, and had just ¥54 billion in cash reserves as of the end of March, against recall costs that specialists say may ultimately exceed ¥1 trillion. A committee of lawyers and other   advisers appointed by the company this year said it risked bankruptcy if it did not find a rescue, and last month Takata hired the American investment bank Lazard to lead the search. Takata and its bankers have held discussions with a range of potential white knights, according to news reports, including the American buyout fund KKR  Company, formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and a Chinese car parts maker, Ningbo Joyson. Japanese automakers and banks, as well as the Japanese government, are also seen as potential contributors to a bailout. The most crucial question for Takata, specialists say, is how much of the recall costs will ultimately be borne by its automaker customers, rather than by the company itself. Fourteen carmakers have been affected by the airbag problem, in which the devices’ inflaters can explode with too much force, sending shrapnel flying into a vehicle’s cabin. The latest deadly incident, a crash on Saturday in Malaysia that killed a    woman, involved a 2005 Honda City. The model had been recalled, but the vehicle had not been taken in to have the airbag component replaced, according to a spokesman for Honda Motor. In the most recent report on the airbag problem last month, safety regulators in the United States said prolonged exposure to environmental moisture and wide temperature fluctuations could degrade the propellant that Takata used in its inflaters, making it unstable and prone to unexpectedly exploding. Based on the finding, which was consistent with theories put forward by engineers and other specialists, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ordered Takata to work with automakers to recall an additional 35 million to 40 million airbags, bringing the number recalled in the United States to nearly 64 million. Carmakers have paid most of the bills for repairing defective airbags so far. They can try to recoup costs from Takata, but the amount is negotiable and subject to complicated calculations. Forcing Takata to repay the full cost would almost certainly bankrupt the company, depriving carmakers of a supplier that, for all its problems, is crucial to keeping their assembly lines running. Takata is one of just three major airbag manufacturers worldwide and controls 25 percent to 30 percent of the market, according to industry researchers. And cost sharing is vital to finding a savior for Takata: The more the recall costs are absorbed by carmakers, the more attractive Takata will look to potential investors. The intricate negotiations over cost sharing, which involve Takata, carmakers, potential investors and Japanese banks that have lent Takata money, are expected to take months. “There’s KKR, other funds, companies from China, Japan, American, maybe India  —   20 or 30 companies are interested,” Mr. Endo said. “It all depends on the cost split. We’re likely to see a very complex structure that limits any one party’s responsibility. ”",0,1043,23.704545454545453,44,0.3825503355704698,0,0,0,0,95.85963928435753,15.305468048516948,65.6549838429033,12.930890093333591,0.8015340364333653,0.016299137104506232,0.046021093000958774,0.023969319271332695,0.038350910834132314,0.007670182166826462,0.14956855225311602,0.0019175455417066154,0.0028763183125599234,0.014381591562799617,0.09587727708533078,0,0.06903163950143816,0.0028763183125599234,0.0009587727708533077,0.01725790987535954,0.005752636625119847,0.12080536912751678,0.0009587727708533077,0.06807286673058485,0.031639501438159155,0.04793863854266539,0,0.0019175455417066154,0.027804410354745925,0.019175455417066157,0.0862895493767977,0,0.004793863854266539,0,0.0009587727708533077,0,0.010546500479386385,0.04314477468839885,0,0,0.42953020134228187,0.0028763183125599234,0.011505273250239693,0.003835091083413231,0.003835091083413231,0.04122722914669223,0.0009587727708533077,0,0.027804410354745925,0.012464046021093002,0.005752636625119847,0.02109300095877277,0.040268456375838924,0.019175455417066157,0.00862895493767977,0.023969319271332695,0,0.0009587727708533077,0.03547459252157239,0.22435282837967402,0.005752636625119847,0,0.019175455417066157,0.0488974113135187,0.10067114093959731,0.01821668264621285,0.014381591562799617,0.04410354745925216,0.14669223394055608,0.059443911792905084,0.023010546500479387,0,0.011505273250239693,0.11984659635666348,0,0.004793863854266539,0.01821668264621285,0.005752636625119847,0.007670182166826462,0,0,0.011505273250239693,0.07957813998082454,0.06040268456375839,0,0.03451581975071908,0.0019175455417066154,0.04314477468839885,0.11409395973154363,0.12080536912751678,0.0009587727708533077,0.0728667305848514,0,16,0,62.875,0,7.75,7,24.575,25,4.83,106.25,8.65,0,10.625,9.75,16,0,47.855,31.575,191.125,266.555,47.855,,0.3503793320098116,0,0.6794374324527971,0,0.2071373160758784,0.19091884192380093,0.45308062975657354,0.4573327400375149,0.14002112919495968,0.7817397717598816,0.22576136026343255,0,0.2637144288603769,0.2473690465759769,0.6406000968825544,0,0.03882585361302335,0.025617518082357377,0.1550640742198117,0.2162621546300165,-0.8722881874560959,0.7837378453699835,77
64,"BIRMINGHAM, England  —   On Saturday night at the Genting Arena here, a billowing white curtain whipped up and into the ceiling to reveal the singer Ozzy Osbourne, who, for perhaps the last time ever as the frontman of Black Sabbath, plunged into the 1970 song that gave the band its name. The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called “The End,” which the   band has billed as its last performances. After 49 years, the group  —   which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members  —   finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert. “Let’s go crazy,” Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd, adding an expletive early in the concert, before turning in thrashing renditions of the band’s   songs, including “War Pigs,” “Into the Void” and “Iron Man,” and deeper cuts like the instrumental “Rat Salad. ” Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises  —   perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer, Bill Ward, estranged from the group since 2012. But Black Sabbath played it straight, turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960s and ’70s songs, pretty much unadulterated (but, of course, quite loud). Flanked by the original band members Tony Iommi (on guitar) and Geezer Butler (on bass) and backed by Tommy Clufetos, a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour, Mr. Osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone, undulating back and forth as he sang. There were pyrotechnics for the big numbers, confetti at the end, and at one point a surprise volley of fireworks onstage. Giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song, and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night. Nearly a   ago, Black Sabbath began as a blues band. It quickly morphed into its own genre. In the band’s early years, its   anthems and vague overtures toward Satanism in its lyrics earned them ridicule from mainstream critics and audiences while mobilizing a growing underground fan base. Mr. Osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living, and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert. But Mr. Osbourne’s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 MTV reality TV show “The Osbournes,” which portrayed him as a lovable, murmuring goofball and family man. And at its closing concert, Black Sabbath seemed pretty mainstream. On Saturday, the crowd was dotted with   fans decked out in    Black Sabbath regalia. But most concertgoers wore their fandom more lightly: One man in a Black Sabbath shirt who declined to give his name said that he worked in financial services in London and read an issue of The Economist in the moments before the lights went down. By the time Mr. Osbourne hit the climax of “Black Sabbath,” the magazine was tucked away and the man was on his feet with his hands raised in the shape of devil’s horns, singing gleefully along to the lyrics: “Satan’s sitting there, he’s   those flames get higher and higher. ” The band has always identified as rough and tumble, alternative, working class and distinctly Birminghamian, so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on Saturday. “Black Sabbath are part of the cultural identity of being in Birmingham,” said Pamela Pinski, 31, who lives and works in the area. Coming to the concert, she added, felt “kind of patriotic to the city,” and like a chance to celebrate “local boys that done good. ” In interviews, the band members have insisted that “The End”  —   which began in Omaha just over a year ago and made stops in Europe, South America and Australia before coming to Britain last month  —   really is their last run. Mr. Iommi, who learned he had cancer several years ago, told Rolling Stone that his “body won’t take it much more. ” And Mr. Osbourne said in a recent interview with the BBC, “This is definitely it. ” Mr. Osbourne has said goodbyes to music before, though, so you could forgive fans for not taking him entirely at his word: In 1992, he went on a farewell tour that he billed as his swan song. Three years later, he was on the road again. Outside the arena, Errol Lynch, 45, was one of several fans who said he thought the band had more in store. “Two years down the line, they’ll say, ‘Let’s put our problem behind us,’” he said, adding that even if the band wouldn’t tour again, “they will do an odd festival. ” Mr. Lynch, originally from Ireland, was in Birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week. (Mr. Osbourne, who has performed with other bands and as a solo act, and who was estranged from Black Sabbath through much of the 1980s and ’90s, has at least one solo date planned for this summer, in Illinois.) Mr. Osbourne had said that he was feeling emotional in the   to Saturday’s concert, but he gave only a fleeting farewell speech, marveling at “what a journey we’ve all had. ” Several times throughout the night he thanked the audience, and at one point he got down on his knees and bowed. When the last song, “Paranoid,” ended, he blew a kiss, took some final bows, then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage. In the arena lobby after the concert, Mike King, 32, who had traveled from San Francisco, said that he ranked the show among Black Sabbath’s better recent performances. “I’m really, really, really going to miss them,” he said, adding, “Once they’re gone, that’s it. ”",0,973,27.02777777777778,36,0.27852004110996914,0,0,0,0,96.01819906711994,25.010012266684356,85.7467999626273,34.701381751741465,0.8180883864337102,0.010277492291880781,0.048304213771839674,0.029804727646454265,0.025693730729701953,0.015416238437821172,0.21274409044193218,0.003083247687564234,0.0010277492291880781,0.020554984583761562,0.10483042137718397,0,0.0421377183967112,0.011305241521068859,0.007194244604316547,0.0020554984583761563,0.006166495375128468,0.050359712230215826,0.003083247687564234,0.08735868448098665,0.03391572456320658,0.05960945529290853,0,0.003083247687564234,0.015416238437821172,0.0051387461459403904,0.06166495375128469,0,0.0010277492291880781,0.0051387461459403904,0.0010277492291880781,0,0.007194244604316547,0.065775950668037,0.0010277492291880781,0.0010277492291880781,0.4552929085303186,0.003083247687564234,0.03391572456320658,0.0020554984583761563,0.0010277492291880781,0.0421377183967112,0,0.0010277492291880781,0.009249743062692703,0.017471736896197326,0.044193216855087356,0.046248715313463515,0.007194244604316547,0.018499486125385406,0.003083247687564234,0.010277492291880781,0,0,0.024665981500513873,0.2199383350462487,0.006166495375128468,0.0041109969167523125,0.05960945529290853,0.047276464542651594,0.08221993833504625,0.044193216855087356,0.015416238437821172,0.022610483042137718,0.15210688591983557,0.08633093525179857,0.023638232271325797,0,0.044193216855087356,0.17882836587872558,0.013360739979445015,0.015416238437821172,0.003083247687564234,0.0010277492291880781,0.020554984583761562,0,0,0.029804727646454265,0.12024665981500514,0.08838643371017471,0,0.01644398766700925,0.007194244604316547,0.07399794450154162,0.10277492291880781,0.10894141829393628,0.0051387461459403904,0.01644398766700925,0.0010277492291880781,18,0,28.25,0,1,15,0,8,16.83,21,7,18,26.175,0,18,31,68.005,56,41.25,161.255,68.005,,0.40149162409079436,0,0.5128641233315778,0,0.03592881186369607,0.3585701736362871,0,0.22966848451216434,0.385453840267048,0.43902914096755197,0.2068997170044446,0.40149162409079436,0.49379510624104805,0,0.1827439976315568,0.536027852158001,0.06248994950631974,0.05145852764287781,0.037904719022655534,0.14817758705450468,0.5850815771186539,0.8518224129454953,46
65,"Police in San Jose arrested a teenage trio that had terrorized and robbed over a dozen minimarts and gas stations at gunpoint or knifepoint over three months while wearing Geisha masks. [According to the San Jose Mercury News, the group known as the “Geisha Dolls” crew targeted businesses in San Jose and Milpitas, and in some cases   the store workers, between Oct. 23 and Jan. 25.  They were given the name because their masks resemble the white powder makeup that Japanese geishas traditionally applied to their faces. The group consists of three teenagers. Two are 17 and one is 16. Authorities have reportedly withheld their names because they are minors. According to NBC Bay Area, a break in the case arrived on January 25 when “police arrested a juvenile suspect in connection to a robbery at the Arco   located at 2104 N Capitol Ave. Officers searched his residence and found evidence of the Arco   robbery. ” Nearly three weeks later, on Feb. 14, members of the Metro Unit reportedly located arrested a    and a    juvenile in San Jose .

66,"Megyn Kelly is gearing up for the debut of her Sunday newsmagazine show on NBC in June  —   and the anchor’s first   interview on her new network may be with the Kardashian family. [According to TMZ, the former Fox News star was spotted in Los Angeles Thursday morning headed into the same studio in which the   family were filming a 10th anniversary special for Today.  The whole family was reportedly there, including Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie, Kendall, and Kris Jenner  —   though brother Rob Kardashian was absent, as was Caitlyn Jenner, who remained in New York on a press tour. Sources told TMZ that Kelly taped an interview with the family and it would be the centerpiece of the anchor’s debut Sunday news show on NBC in June. Kelly is set to headline both a Sunday show and a morning news show when she begins working at NBC next month, though the morning show is not expected to premiere until later this fall. The Sunday show will reportedly be produced by former Dateline executive producer David Corvo and NBC producer Elizabeth Cole. The New York Post‘s Page Six reported this month that NBC News chairman Andy Lack had traveled to Russia in an attempt to obtain what would likely be a ratings bonanza, an exclusive interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The network was rumored to be trying to get the Putin interview for Kelly’s debut show, though established NBC anchors Matt Lauer and Lester Holt were also said to be in the mix to do the   interview. Kelly reportedly turned down a $100 million,   contract offer to return to Fox News, telling the Washington Post‘s Erik Wemple in December that she wanted her next job to have “greater balance” so she could spend more time with her children.

67,"At the Democratic National Convention this summer, Hillary Clinton said   were due for a tax increase. “This is not because we resent success,” she said. “But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that’s where the money is. ” But defining America’s 1 percent  —   and finding out “where the money is”  —   has become an increasingly subjective endeavor. As wealth becomes more concentrated in certain states and even counties, the gap between the national 1 percent and the local 1 percent is growing, creating wealth clusters that are pulling away from the rest of the country. To be in the top 1 percent of incomes nationally, families need to take in a minimum of $389, 436. The average income of America’s   is $1, 153, 293, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute. Yet when incomes are measured state by state, the study shows wildly diverging fortunes for  .   in the New York metro area (which includes parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) earn at least $673, 000. Those in the   Conn. area make at least $1. 4 million. Both are eclipsed by the   of Jackson, Wyo. who earn at least $1. 7 million. Why Jackson? Billionaires have been flocking to Wyoming, attracted by its outdoor lifestyle and low taxes. Teton County, Wyo. is the richest in America when it comes to 1 percent incomes, with   earning more than $2. 2 million. New York County, or Manhattan, ranks second, with a $1. 44 million threshold, followed by Fairfield County, Conn. with just under $1. 4 million. The tech boom has helped the 1 percent in San Mateo County and Marin County, Calif. where they earn at least $1. 1 million. By contrast, you need only $97, 000 to be a   in Holmes County, Miss. or Lamar County, Ala. or $108, 000 in Grayson County, Va. “All high incomes are going up, but they’re going up much faster in places like New York, Maryland and California,” said Mark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center and   of the Economic Policy Institute study. It’s no surprise that the most expensive states have the highest incomes at the top. And wealth, by nature, has always been relative. Yet economists and wealth experts say the economic distance between   in rich states and the   in middling or even affluent states has widened drastically, creating a new national landscape of the 1 percent. “We have a growing concentration of wealth and income by locality,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. “The   localities and those top earners are moving away from the rest of the country. ” Regionally, the Northeast has been pulling away the fastest. The income threshold of the top 1 percent surged 101 percent in the Northeast from 1979 to 2013, according to Mr. Price. In the South and Midwest, the threshold has grown by about half that. In Massachusetts,  ’ incomes jumped 130 percent from 1979 to 2013 they’ve increased by 112 percent in New York and 113 percent in New Jersey. In New Mexico, they’ve grown only 22 percent over the same period, and in Nevada, only 15 percent. Yet the rich are also moving beyond the traditional hubs of the Northeast and California, creating some unlikely   enclaves, such as Wyoming. North Dakota also moved up the   ranks  —   from 45th to ninth from 1979 to 2013  —   as the oil boom lifted the fortunes of its fortunate. The new peaks and valleys of America’s elite have made national definitions less and less useful. The 1 percent is no longer the very top layer of the national economy, but a much deeper slice of residents in     states like New York, Connecticut and California. The shift has important policy and cultural implications. Calls to tax the 1 percent nationally are really calls to tax the top 5 or 10 percent in the richest states  —   while missing the top 1 percent in many Western and Southern states. “A tax on the 1 percent is increasingly a regional tax,” Mr. Price said. “On average, more folks will be touched by higher rates in New York than, say, West Virginia. ” Many economists say that’s as it should be  —   people making more than $389, 000 should pay higher tax rates, regardless of where they live. “They should pay more,” Mr. Wolff of N. Y. U. said. “It shouldn’t matter where they live. They’re earning large amounts of money. ” Yet they may not feel like top earners. People making $389, 000 in New York or Connecticut, for instance, are only in the top 10 percent for their states. They may not feel like   since so many people around them are far richer. “I have friends who may be in the 1 percent nationally but say they don’t feel rich because they have friends who are richer,” Mr. Wolff said. “Psychologically they don’t feel like a  . They don’t feel rich. But they really are. ”",0,839,13.317460317460318,63,0.29797377830750893,0,0,0,0,93.79742093726493,56.960397298371085,60.35449711194646,66.38234292525115,0.8617401668653158,0.028605482717520857,0.08462455303933254,0.03575685339690107,0.03098927294398093,0.007151370679380214,0.22169249106078665,0.0011918951132300357,0,0.017878426698450536,0.08462455303933254,0,0.07389749702026222,0.003575685339690107,0,0.014302741358760428,0.003575685339690107,0.07151370679380215,0,0.07032181168057211,0.058402860548271755,0.05601907032181168,0,0,0.025029797377830752,0.00834326579261025,0.07747318235995232,0,0.0023837902264600714,0.007151370679380214,0.0011918951132300357,0,0.007151370679380214,0.026221692491060787,0.0023837902264600714,0.0023837902264600714,0.42789034564958284,0.0023837902264600714,0.015494636471990465,0.0023837902264600714,0.0011918951132300357,0.02264600715137068,0.0011918951132300357,0,0.013110846245530394,0.015494636471990465,0.0011918951132300357,0.004767580452920143,0.057210965435041714,0.025029797377830752,0.010727056019070322,0.004767580452920143,0.0011918951132300357,0,0.07985697258641239,0.3528009535160906,0.02264600715137068,0.0011918951132300357,0.025029797377830752,0.07985697258641239,0.08224076281287247,0.025029797377830752,0.026221692491060787,0.05363528009535161,0.14541120381406436,0.04767580452920143,0.05601907032181168,0.0011918951132300357,0.028605482717520857,0.1907032181168057,0,0.009535160905840286,0,0.003575685339690107,0.0011918951132300357,0,0.0011918951132300357,0.0011918951132300357,0.058402860548271755,0.13110846245530394,0,0.014302741358760428,0.017878426698450536,0.03575685339690107,0.11203814064362336,0.12872467222884387,0.0023837902264600714,0.05363528009535161,0.0023837902264600714,19,0,4.925,0,4.875,0,21.875,3,3,3,11,34.84,4,0,19,0,76.715,21.875,10.925,92.64,76.715,,0.3486463796144118,0,0.12184116362301357,0,0.12075356556531909,0,0.3812870174554988,0.07792920551222468,0.07792920551222468,0.07792920551222468,0.23657705503474508,0.4953332985191738,0.1012748511208929,0,0.1012748511208929,0,0.08565383412978429,0.02442387566432942,0.012197981331785093,0.10343441561341611,0.7238435932723406,0.8965655843865838,36

69,"The chief executive of Wells Fargo, John G. Stumpf, will say in testimony Tuesday morning that he is “deeply sorry” for selling customers unauthorized bank accounts and credit cards and that he takes “full responsibility” for the unethical activity, according to a copy of the remarks prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing. In his testimony, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Stumpf strikes a decidedly contrite tone about the scandal over the fake accounts, which has engulfed Wells Fargo since it reached a $185 million settlement with regulators on Sept. 8. Mr. Stumpf has been criticized for publicly attributing the illegal activity to approximately 5, 300 employees who were fired as a result of the sham accounts. Former employees say that workers felt enormous pressure to bend the rules to meet unrealistic sales goals set at the highest levels of the bank. At the same time, Mr. Stumpf will tell lawmakers that the illegal activity, which also included as many as 565, 000 unauthorized credit cards and 1. 5 million sham bank accounts, was not part of an “orchestrated effort, or scheme, as some have called it, by the company. ” “We never directed nor wanted our employees, whom we refer to as team members, to provide products and services to customers they did not want or need,” he will say, according to his testimony. On Tuesday, Mr. Stumpf is expected to face questions from the Senate Banking Committee over what the top managers at Wells Fargo knew about the widespread illegal sales activity and what they had done to stop it since it was first made public almost three years ago. Employees were still being fired well into this year for selling questionable accounts. In his testimony, Mr. Stumpf acknowledged that the bank failed to do enough to stop the behavior from continuing. “I want to apologize for not doing more sooner to address the causes of this unacceptable activity. ”",0,324,23.142857142857142,14,0.3271604938271605,0,0,0,0,93.53765097225013,6.774339740584463,75.15663580246914,7.766127629977396,0.8364197530864198,0.024691358024691357,0.046296296296296294,0.021604938271604937,0.033950617283950615,0.018518518518518517,0.15123456790123457,0.0030864197530864196,0.0030864197530864196,0,0.08024691358024691,0,0.06172839506172839,0.0030864197530864196,0.0030864197530864196,0.021604938271604937,0.0030864197530864196,0.08641975308641975,0,0.06172839506172839,0.033950617283950615,0.043209876543209874,0,0,0.018518518518518517,0.015432098765432098,0.12037037037037036,0,0,0.0030864197530864196,0,0,0.018518518518518517,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0.44135802469135804,0,0.018518518518518517,0.0030864197530864196,0.0030864197530864196,0.05555555555555555,0.0030864197530864196,0,0.018518518518518517,0.021604938271604937,0.012345679012345678,0.033950617283950615,0.05864197530864197,0.0030864197530864196,0.015432098765432098,0.024691358024691357,0,0.0030864197530864196,0.037037037037037035,0.23148148148148148,0.0030864197530864196,0,0.021604938271604937,0.05555555555555555,0.13580246913580246,0.037037037037037035,0.009259259259259259,0.08024691358024691,0.1574074074074074,0.09259259259259259,0.015432098765432098,0,0.030864197530864196,0.11419753086419752,0,0.009259259259259259,0.009259259259259259,0.006172839506172839,0,0,0,0.018518518518518517,0.09567901234567901,0.05555555555555555,0,0.018518518518518517,0.006172839506172839,0.05555555555555555,0.12345679012345678,0.11419753086419752,0.009259259259259259,0.09567901234567901,0,0,0,52,1,4,3,8,30,0,25,0,1,2,0,0,0,6,13,91.8,109.8,6,,0,0,0.7565485034672282,0.05639139975154663,0.19292728076790167,0.15202805015514587,0.3234518715067226,0.6419419098057333,0,0.5990434398056875,0,0.05639139975154663,0.10676232268609791,0,0.43532253583758684,0,0.014713094654242274,0.03187837175085826,0.2251103482099068,0.26924963217263365,-0.8788087898621512,0.7307503678273664,26
70,"CNN has released a statement trying to distance their reports from BuzzFeed’s decision to publish unverifiable memos about   Donald Trump. [Midday Tuesday, CNN tweeted a full statement from their Twitter account saying,   CNN’s decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different than BuzzFeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. The Trump team knows this. They are using BuzzFeed’s decision to deflect from CNN’s reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organisations. The statement continues,  We are fully confident in our reporting. It represents the core of what the First Amendment protects, informing the people of the inner workings of their government in this case, briefing materials prepared for President Obama and   Trump last week. We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the   document because we have not corroborated the report’s allegations. The statement then poses a direct challenge to the transition team of   Trump, Given that members of the Trump transition team have so vocally criticized our reporting, we encourage them to identify, specifically, what they believe to be inaccurate. CNN’s report is here. Buzzfeed’s report is here.   Update: Buzzfeed editors are trying to avoid a public argument with CNN over their decision to publish the unverified documents.  Editor @BuzzFeedBen tells me they’re ”not going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other” following CNN criticism,  —   Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 11, 2017,  The full comment from CNN can be read below: Statement from CNN: pic. twitter.   —   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) January 11, 2017,  Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart Tech covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

71,"“If you were to look at our game board of all the possible outcomes of the election, this one wasn’t even on the sheet. ” That was how Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of the large health insurer Aetna, described the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president. He was speaking with me last Thursday on stage at The New York Times’s annual conference, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term. “We started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday. We had no idea how to approach it,” Mr. Bertolini said. Business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how Mr. Trump’s election and Republican control of the White House, Senate and House  —   which may make Washington’s notorious gridlock a memory  —   will reshape economic policy. The stock market has jumped, taking many prognosticators by surprise, in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised: a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act, a dismantling of the   regulations for Wall Street, a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates, and a major infrastructure spending program, among other things. While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change, the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board. Take, for instance, the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the law, its view is more nuanced. Most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law. So it’s hard to see how even the law’s   opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that Mr. Trump said he would pursue. “That omelet has been made that toothpaste is out of the tube,” Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at the conference. “I wouldn’t want regulation to be repealed in toto,” he added. “If you want to be good for bankers, you have to have policies that would be good for economic growth. ” More likely than a repeal, Mr. Trump’s administration will try to eliminate the components he has criticized most. A Trump administration could try to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency created by   which Republicans loathe, for example. “The C. F. P. B. probably won’t be eliminated,” Ian Katz, a research analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. “It would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little guy. ” Mr. Katz predicted that the Trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied for: a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission. Mr. Trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than $10 billion in assets. Currently, such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory category, one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements. This rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition. As for the return of    —   something Mr. Trump has talked about  —   don’t bet on it. “The Republican Party’s call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking shouldn’t be taken seriously,” Mr. Katz wrote. “That was part of a campaign document. Big banks are useful as a populist scapegoat, and Trump may continue to use them in that way. But neither he or his top aides are interested in   2. 0. ” Piecemeal change may also be true of Mr. Trump’s pledge to undo Obamacare, which was one of his bedrock campaign promises. Mr. Bertolini of Aetna predicted: “There will be a repeal first, and I think the repeal will be at a minimum in name. ” It’s nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch. “Because what’s going to happen in the next year?” he said. “We have people signed up we have to honor that through 2017. We’ll have to work quickly to have something for 2018. ” Mr. Bertolini said that whatever replacement plan might materialize, the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act. “You can’t put them out on the street without insurance,” he said. His expectation is that Medicare Advantage will be expanded. The backpedaling on the “repeal” pledge has already begun: Mr. Trump has said in the past several days that he intends to make sure that health insurers will not be able to turn away people with   conditions, and that people under the age of 26 will still be able to have coverage under their parents’ plans. About the latter provision, Mr. Trump said he would “very much try and keep that. ” In an interview with Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday night, the   said that the measure “adds cost, but it’s very much something we’re going to try and keep. ” Of course, the biggest question is how Mr. Trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in America. He has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade agreements, increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants  —   both for security reasons, he contends, and because they take jobs from Americans. How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyone’s guess. One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs. “The jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,” Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference. That’s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trump’s ambitions. Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits. “Manufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,” he said. “We take that for granted. ” Despite all of the   among C. E. O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism  —   or at least a sense of hope  —   that pervaded their words. “We all know a lot about Trump the campaigner  —   now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,” Mr. Blankfein said. “He will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,” he continued. “I assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change. ” Mr. Blankfein added, “I’m going to see how it goes before I become mournful. ”",0,1151,17.439393939393938,66,0.28236316246741966,0,0,0,0,88.33356087873898,9.71160425471342,74.8381771811328,60.355777584708946,0.8444830582102519,0.018245004344048653,0.04170286707211121,0.03475238922675934,0.03301476976542137,0.013032145960034752,0.19548218940052128,0.0017376194613379669,0.0017376194613379669,0.020851433536055605,0.08688097306689835,0,0.09643788010425716,0.0069504778453518675,0.0026064291920069507,0.02780191138140747,0.007819287576020852,0.10773240660295395,0.004344048653344918,0.046046915725456126,0.018245004344048653,0.044309296264118156,0,0.0008688097306689834,0.018245004344048653,0.01737619461337967,0.1103388357949609,0,0.0017376194613379669,0.0017376194613379669,0,0,0.02780191138140747,0.036490008688097306,0.0017376194613379669,0.0017376194613379669,0.48566463944396177,0.004344048653344918,0.011294526498696786,0.0017376194613379669,0.005212858384013901,0.052997393570807995,0.0017376194613379669,0,0.016507384882710686,0.014769765421372719,0.0034752389226759338,0.03475238922675934,0.023457862728062554,0.02693310165073849,0.010425716768027803,0.0069504778453518675,0.0017376194613379669,0,0.014769765421372719,0.2519548218940052,0.007819287576020852,0,0.021720243266724587,0.0738488271068636,0.0842745438748914,0.04257167680278019,0.02519548218940052,0.05994787141615986,0.1520417028670721,0.09556907037358818,0.022589052997393572,0.0008688097306689834,0.04170286707211121,0.1259774109470026,0,0.01737619461337967,0.0069504778453518675,0.0008688097306689834,0.005212858384013901,0,0,0.016507384882710686,0.08514335360556038,0.06255430060816682,0,0.03127715030408341,0.005212858384013901,0.03735881841876629,0.16594265855777585,0.1676802780191138,0.008688097306689836,0.07298001737619461,0.0069504778453518675,22,0,35.7,4,7,12,15,21.025,21.725,27.725,20,24.7,29,3,22,30.5,115.42500000000001,56.5,86.425,245.35,115.42500000000001,,0.3771527433992079,0,0.49561440772062026,0.09917731364776043,0.16154416187583737,0.24828371682826428,0.29221649656397125,0.36656505318293225,0.374202477745072,0.43281896942836146,0.3550392228080413,0.40470702617866566,0.44388793992886666,0.07627415159993112,0.3771527433992079,0.456369543552744,0.08715596330275231,0.042662438177219014,0.06525842866311776,0.18526069392532185,0.530256963742666,0.8147393060746781,72

73,"Halloween is here again. That means your   have planted surprise spiders around the office. You’ve been invited to a haunted hayride. Your neighbor’s yard has a full cemetery, rigged with motion detectors and   zombies.   from the start, I have always dreaded this time of year. Haunted houses, ghost tours and horror film fests are not my thing, and why people love having the daylights scared out of them completely escapes me. I decided to try to understand my friends who are on the lookout for thrills this time of year. As it turns out, there are many possible reasons some people like to be scared stiff. Each person’s threshold for experiences that provoke fear is made up of a unique recipe that blends nature and nurture. “The ingredients vary from person to person,” said Frank Farley, a psychologist at Temple University and a former president of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Farley is interested in what draws certain people to extreme behaviors, like driving racecars, climbing Mount Everest and flying hot air balloons across oceans. In the 1980s, he coined the term “Type T” personality to refer to the behavioral profile of  . What makes someone   he said, comes down to a mix of genes, environment and early development. David Zald, a neuropsychologist at Vanderbilt University, studies one piece of the equation. His research partly focuses on dopamine, a chemical involved in our brain’s response to reward. In the past, he has found that people who lack what he calls “brakes” on dopamine release tend to pursue thrilling activities. When you go to a haunted house, you’re grappling with a conflict, Dr. Zald said: The experience could either be fun or terrifying, and how you weigh that balance could depend in part on dopamine levels. “Having a greater amount of dopamine pushes someone to pursue the goal of excitement,” he said, “whereas someone who basically has less dopamine is more likely to hold back and say, ‘No, this isn’t worth it to me. ’” Socially, we get cues about how to respond to fear from those around us, said Margee Kerr, a sociologist and author of the book “Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear. ” Early on, that’s taking notes from our parents about how to deal with distress. Later, experiencing stressful situations with others can cultivate social bonds. Part of that has to do with emotional contagion, or a communal response to shared experiences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend is captivated by the horror movie you are watching together, you process that by recreating the same feeling in your own mind, and that can bring you closer together. People also tend to hold onto memories of fear more intensely, she said, so if you have positive associations with a scary situation, like going to a haunted house, you’ll likely want to do it again.   can also be a way of testing oneself. Josh Randall and Kristjan Thor, creators of Blackout, a haunted house experience that consistently tops rankings of “Most Extreme Haunted Houses,” said they see many people coming to their events with a goal of  . “It’s almost like a dare to themselves,” Mr. Thor said. “People want to be able to conquer something. ” For many, being scared is a jolting escape from daily life. When immersed in a scary situation, you can suspend your disbelief and live in the moment  —   and that loss of control can feel really good. This is key for Blackout, Mr. Randall said: “For a finite period of time, that audience member can turn off the real world, and live in a fantasy world. ” After talking with the experts, I was starting to see why some friends love getting spooked. But why do I hate being scared so much? It could be because I was never exposed to horror movies or haunted houses growing up, so by the time I did experience these things, I was  . It could be that the regions in my brain involved in coding fear and anxiety are more sensitive. Most likely, it is a mix of many different factors. Regardless of the reason though, “it’s perfectly O. K. not to like scary things,” Dr. Kerr said. For people who cannot fathom sitting out a haunted house, it’s important not to coerce your more cautious friends into doing something they do not want to, Dr. Kerr said. “That can compound the fear, and make it even worse. ” So, for any friends who were thinking of inviting me to the haunted house this weekend, save your breath  —   I have a doctor’s note.",0,773,19.82051282051282,39,0.3208279430789133,0,0,0,0,81.23134555734815,13.887695220953558,81.39530086360617,5.993747304872789,0.8576972833117723,0.01164294954721863,0.06080206985769728,0.03880983182406209,0.0724450194049159,0.028460543337645538,0.19146183699870634,0.00129366106080207,0.027166882276843468,0.016817593790426907,0.06597671410090557,0.00129366106080207,0.08020698576972833,0.02199223803363519,0.0038809831824062097,0.02199223803363519,0.007761966364812419,0.09961190168175937,0.0038809831824062097,0.0724450194049159,0.028460543337645538,0.04915912031047866,0,0.0038809831824062097,0.02328589909443726,0.014230271668822769,0.07761966364812418,0,0.00129366106080207,0.0038809831824062097,0.00129366106080207,0,0.0038809831824062097,0.03234152652005175,0.007761966364812419,0.007761966364812419,0.4851228978007762,0.014230271668822769,0.018111254851228976,0.0129366106080207,0.018111254851228976,0.062095730918499355,0.00258732212160414,0.00129366106080207,0.014230271668822769,0.02069857697283312,0.01164294954721863,0.01034928848641656,0.00129366106080207,0.02199223803363519,0.01034928848641656,0.045278137128072445,0.00258732212160414,0,0.00258732212160414,0.25485122897800777,0.00258732212160414,0,0.03363518758085381,0.062095730918499355,0.04915912031047866,0.062095730918499355,0.027166882276843468,0.02069857697283312,0.15135834411384216,0.12419146183699871,0.028460543337645538,0.00129366106080207,0.03234152652005175,0.11384217335058215,0.00129366106080207,0.015523932729624839,0.009055627425614488,0.00129366106080207,0.0038809831824062097,0,0,0.01034928848641656,0.11384217335058215,0.05821474773609314,0,0.031047865459249677,0.00646830530401035,0.03492884864165589,0.13454075032341525,0.14747736093143596,0.00517464424320828,0.02069857697283312,0.02199223803363519,22.25,2,25,0,4,20.125,8,26,38.675,263.40625,21.15,21.675,51.2,0,22.25,10,133.025,54,303.40625,473.98125,133.025,,0.4434171772677092,0.0668259796070564,0.4723354979899811,0,0.12528000045831353,0.4188042148734861,0.2226645819836635,0.4821200218844706,0.5806753633469138,0.904136111478552,0.4309424408065655,0.4369653089208455,0.6470489505593777,0,0.31762723590506137,0.2636541189343807,0.11457980049204068,0.04651237907588947,0.26133604655544607,0.40825917731229505,-0.8961318456957451,0.591740822687705,86
74,"By Thomas Sowell November 1, 2016 The political left keeps announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs, that life is unfair. Have they never read Thomas Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” more than two and a half centuries ago? What about economic historian David S. Landes’ statement: “The world has never been a level playing field”? In the joint autobiography of Milton Friedman and his wife Rose, they say: “Everywhere in the world, there are gross inequities of income and wealth. They offend most of us. Few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others.” Moreover, Professor Friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice, so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life. What is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new, such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress? More important, what test of evidence — if any — have they ever subjected their notions to? No one has presented the social vision of the left more often than Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times — and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision “just don’t get it,” as he has repeatedly declared. Mr. Kristof’s essay “Growing Up Poor in America” in the October 30th New York Times is a classic example of the mindset of the left. It begins with the story of a poor black teenager in Arkansas, being raised by a single mom. Sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book. But it does have television sets with huge screens, and apparently, there is money enough to buy marijuana. Surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy. The circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances. Moreover, he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement. But that is not enough for Mr. Kristof or for the political left in general. Of such youngsters he says, “as a society, we fail them long before they fail us.” Whoa! Just when did “society” make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in? And just when did “society” acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it? When the left says “society” they usually mean government. That is apparently what “society” means in this case, for Kristof laments that this teenager is “the kind of person whom America’s presidential candidates just don’t talk about.” If the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies, that is their right. But, if they expect the rest of us to share that belief, surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test. But we can, however. The 1960s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to “solve” what they called “social problems.” How did that workout? What were things like before this social vision triumphed? And what were things like afterward? Homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the 1940s and the 1950s. But homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the 1960s, wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades. When the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in Arkansas today. When the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in Arkansas today. Very similar trends occurred in England after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the 1960s. Perhaps it is the left that just doesn’t get it — or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better.

75,"HONG KONG  —   A Chinese company is setting up a rare and potentially   showdown with the American government over its deal to buy a   firm that the United States says could impact national security. The showdown involves Aixtron, a German semiconductor firm being acquired by a Chinese company, Fujian Grand Chip. In a statement on Friday, Aixtron said an American security panel that advises the White House on foreign deals had recommended the two sides drop their plan, citing unspecified national security concerns. Normally, a recommendation like that would be enough to persuade the companies to scotch their plans. But in its statement, Aixtron said it and its Chinese suitor would do something unusual: They would appeal to President Barack Obama directly to approve the deal. Chinese and German companies “plan to continue to actively engage in further discussions to explore means of mitigation that may be amenable” to the White House and the American security panel, according to the Aixtron statement. Mr. Obama has 15 days to decide the fate of the deal, though most likely Mr. Obama will scupper it given presidents usually follow the recommendations of the panel. If the deal is struck down, it would send the message that the United States will continue to carefully scrutinize similar deals  —   and may act quickly to kill them for national security reasons. The unusual move is sure to spotlight the growing tensions between the United States and China over the latter country’s ambitions to become a power in microchips. While China has made major advancements in technology and computers in recent years, its chip industry is in its infancy, and it still relies on foreign companies for the chips that power even sensitive systems. The move will also shine a light on the shadowy security panel that recommended the deal be dropped. The panel  —   called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and commonly known as Cfius  —   has been increasingly at odds with an expansive new Chinese effort to spend billions acquiring foreign   companies. The panel is composed of representatives from major departments and intelligence agencies like Commerce and Justice and the Central Intelligence Agency. Cfius has the power to review any deal that could impact American national security, and either come up with ways to mitigate that impact or recommend the president block the deal. While the Aixtron deal does not involve an American company, Aixtron itself does considerable business in the United States, and lack of American approval would shut that business off. Beijing has highlighted its intentions of catching up to the rest of the world in semiconductors. It has spent hugely to help fund efforts by private Chinese companies and   national champions to acquire foreign firms that make microchips, the brains of everything from supercomputers to smartphones to guided missiles. But Cfius reviews or concerns about them have derailed a number of proposed Chinese acquisitions of chip makers around the world. Earlier this year a group of Chinese investors abandoned plans to spend $2. 9 billion on a majority stake in a business owned by Philips of the Netherlands after Cfius noted the business specialized in a material key to making semiconductors. In the case of Aixtron, the companies are asking Mr. Obama to decide directly  —   a move that has been made only twice before. In 1990 President George H. W. Bush canceled the sale of an aviation company to Chinese bidders. In 2012 President Obama forced a Chinese firm to divest from a wind project deemed too close to a Navy facility in Oregon. The continuing Aixtron saga is a study in how difficult it can be to track which Chinese investments are private and which are state led. In October, The New York Times highlighted how a Chinese customer that dropped a large order  —   in turn crashing Aixtron’s shares  —   had a relationship with the acquirer, Fujian Grand Chip, through government investment funds. The connection doesn’t indicate wrongdoing, but does illustrate the blurred lines between Chinese industrial policy and the constellation of privately owned but   companies that have been tasked with acquiring new Chinese technological capabilities. In a surprise move last month, German authorities withdrew approval for the takeover without specifying a reason. Because Cfius decisions are considered confidential, the regulator did not say what concerns it had with the acquisition. One possibility is Aixtron’s leading position making technology that creates chips based on an advanced semiconductor material called gallium nitride. The technology has been used in tech as mundane as   Disc players, but its resistance to heat and radiation give it a number of military and space applications. Chips based on the technology are used in radar for antiballistic missiles and in an Air Force radar system, called Space Fence, that is used to track space debris. Cfius’s recommendation against the Philips deal earlier this year stemmed in part from that business’s involvement in gallium nitride.",0,821,24.147058823529413,34,0.3848964677222899,0,0,0,0,97.44242032284248,15.301297295207162,61.98102689028389,62.71931249154148,0.7295980511571255,0.02679658952496955,0.03532277710109622,0.014616321559074299,0.031668696711327646,0.0060901339829476245,0.09744214372716199,0.001218026796589525,0.001218026796589525,0.007308160779537149,0.10596833130328867,0,0.06699147381242387,0.001218026796589525,0.001218026796589525,0.02679658952496955,0.0048721071863581,0.08891595615103533,0.001218026796589525,0.031668696711327646,0.01705237515225335,0.04628501827040195,0,0.001218026796589525,0.01705237515225335,0.014616321559074299,0.08404384896467722,0,0,0,0,0,0.013398294762484775,0.029232643118148598,0,0,0.42630937880633374,0,0.0048721071863581,0.00243605359317905,0,0.048721071863580996,0,0,0.01705237515225335,0.0060901339829476245,0.001218026796589525,0.0036540803897685747,0.020706455542021926,0.020706455542021926,0.0048721071863581,0.0060901339829476245,0,0,0.012180267965895249,0.1753958587088916,0.0097442143727162,0,0.0097442143727162,0.04506699147381242,0.0730816077953715,0.0060901339829476245,0.025578562728380026,0.04506699147381242,0.146163215590743,0.05481120584652863,0.007308160779537149,0,0.00243605359317905,0.12911084043848964,0,0.008526187576126675,0.012180267965895249,0.001218026796589525,0.0048721071863581,0,0,0,0.05237515225334957,0.07917174177831912,0,0.015834348355663823,0.0060901339829476245,0.029232643118148598,0.10962241169305725,0.11571254567600488,0,0.05968331303288672,0,32,0,26,9,3,6,0,0,3,20.4,35.1,8,6,0,32,10,82.1,19,64.4,161.1,82.1,,0.5509944538780842,0,0.4992625352688666,0.2565797772742827,0.10317500575623216,0.18705102131189996,0,0,0.10317500575623216,0.43892857892865417,0.5737468203647544,0.23476376130922852,0.18705102131189996,0,0.3946438965569824,0.2771863727725965,0.08808067803883703,0.02038407896148482,0.06909129921682224,0.17283553266816865,0.48977438368282317,0.8271644673318314,50
76,"FBI Obtains Warrant To Search Huma Abedin's Emails   zero hedge While we explained earlier today why the DOJ and FBI had found themselves in the awkward position of knowing that Anthony Weiner's computer contained thousands of Huma Abedin emails sent from Hillary Clinton's private server, yet were unable to access them, we noted it was only a matter of time before this particular hurdle was rectified. A few hours later, according to CBS' Jeff Pegues, in the matter of the FBI having much needed access to begin poring over Weiner's emails, which we now know number roughly 650,000 (and thus will take the FBI months to pore over), the FBI has just obtained the needed warrant. — Jeff Pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) October 30, 2016 As NBC confirms , the FBI obtained a warrant to search emails related to the Hillary Clinton private server probe that were discovered on ex-congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop. The warrant came two days after FBI director James Comey revealed the existence of the emails, which law-enforcement sources said were linked to Weiner's estranged wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI already had a warrant to search Weiner's laptop, but that only applied to evidence of his allegedly illicit communications with an underage girl. The warrant came moments after Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid scolded Comey, saying in a letter that he "" demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another. "" Reid added that his office determined that Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections. The following screengrab from WaPo, perhaps summarizes best how the democrats' take on things has changed dramatically over the past few weeks: Meanwhile, the CBS reporter also noted that according to law enforcement sources HumaAbedin Is cooperating and ""seemed surprised that emails were there."" #developing #law enforcement sources also say #HumaAbedin Is cooperating and ""seemed surprised that emails were there."" — Jeff Pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) October 30, 2016 Finally, Pegues also points out that after having fieled much pressure from Democrats for the past 48 hours, FBI Director Comey has been quietly reaching out to members of Congress as pressure mounts on him. #BREAKING News #FBI Director #Comey has been quietly reaching out to members of #Congress as pressure mounts on him. — Jeff Pegues (@jeffpeguescbs) October 30, 2016 So will the FBI promptly announce that nothing of material important was found among Weiner's emails, or will it now begin a protracted, intensive investigation? Will Comey resigns? Will Huma quit from her role in the Clinton campaign? Will Loretta Lynch take some of the blame? We hope to have some of these much needed answers in the coming days as the FBI's reopened probe begins gaining traction.

77,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The Trump administration is planning to roll out its first concrete measures against China on trade, administration officials said on Thursday, hardening its position toward America’s largest trading partner just as President Trump welcomed President Xi Jinping of China to his seaside club here for their first    meeting. Sometime after Mr. Xi leaves the United States, these officials said, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting countries that dump steel into the American market, an aggressive measure aimed mainly at China. It is unclear exactly what the order would do or how harsh it would be, but it would be designed to begin to make good on Mr. Trump’s promise during the campaign to redress China’s huge trade surplus with the United States. In addition, an official said, the White House is moving out a senior economy policy official, Andrew Quinn, who had helped negotiate the   Partnership, former President Barack Obama’s signature trade initiative. Mr. Quinn had become the subject of a battle between two camps in the White House: economic nationalists, who wanted him out, and more mainstream backers of free trade, who defended him. Taken together, these developments constituted a potentially significant victory for the   coming off a string of setbacks in their efforts to persuade the president to deliver on the most combative    planks of his presidential campaign. But the ultimate outcome of this policy debate is still far from clear, several officials said. Mr. Trump does not plan to confront Mr. Xi with the most aggressive of his campaign threats: a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Nor is the United States likely to designate China a currency manipulator, something he promised to do as a candidate. Holding back those moves suggests Mr. Trump is also heeding the more moderate voices among his advisers, who argue that the United States cannot afford to ignite a trade war with China. “The nativist and nationalist forces certainly have influence,” said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson International Institute for Economics. “But it looks like it’s dwindling rapidly. ” Mr. Lardy said   cases on steel were mostly symbolic, since American imports of steel from China accounted for only a few percentage points of the trade deficit. The Obama administration filed multiple   cases with the World Trade Organization. Still, the pitched battle over trade policy, on the eve of Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Xi, injected an unpredictable note into an encounter that has been billed mostly as a   session for the two leaders. Mr. Trump made it clear the informal setting would not prevent him from confronting his guest with the chronic imbalances between the United State and China. “We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years,” he said to reporters on Air Force One. “That’s one of the things we are going to be talking about. ” Mr. Xi arrived in Florida on Thursday afternoon, stepping off his Air China flight into the humid air of Palm Beach. On Thursday evening, he attended a formal dinner at Mr. Trump’s    estate. A series of meetings were scheduled for Friday morning, followed by a working lunch. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson greeted Mr. Xi and his wife, who walked on a red carpet, flanked by an honor guard carrying flags of both countries. Mr. Trump, who arrived from Washington later, greeted Mr. Xi in an arrival ceremony at the front steps of the estate. Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Tillerson said the president was prepared to demand an “economic relationship that is fair on both sides” and said the chief goal of the nation’s trade policy would be fashioned after the president’s “America First” credo. “To that end,” he said, “we will pursue economic engagement with China that prioritizes the economic   of the American people. ” For weeks leading up to this meeting, China has served as a kind of proxy for Mr. Trump’s advisers to play out their clashing worldviews. The   contingent  —   led by the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and the director of the National Trade Council, Peter Navarro  —   squared off against the more traditional group, which included two former Goldman Sachs executives, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, one official said, has gravitated in recent days toward a tougher line on China. Mr. Bannon, officials said, pushed hard for the removal of Mr. Quinn, a special assistant for international trade, investment and development. Mr. Quinn had the support of his boss, Mr. Cohn, a Democrat who has emerged as an influential voice with Mr. Trump on economic policy. But he was unable to save Mr. Quinn, who will return to his previous post with the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In a conciliatory gesture, the two countries are expected to announce they will continue to hold an annual   dialogue on strategic and economic issues, which began during the George W. Bush administration and continued under Mr. Obama, though there has been some talk of elevating the session to the level of Vice President Mike Pence. Among the sensitive topics that may come up is American concern about the possibility that Chinese investors might seek to purchase the nuclear power business of Westinghouse Electric Co. Westinghouse, once a symbol of America’s leadership in nuclear energy, was forced to file for bankruptcy in late March, in the face of mounting losses. Though many of its wounds were    —   a disastrous deal for a construction business proved too costly  —   broad market and industry forces have also changed the economic calculus for nuclear energy. American officials are profoundly concerned about the potential national security implications of a purchase of Westinghouse by interests with ties to the Chinese government, including the danger that a sale could deliver sensitive nuclear secrets to that nation. A White House official said Thursday that the administration is watching the potential sale closely but declined to comment on options that the United States government might have to block the sale to Chinese interests. Bloomberg News first reported about the government’s concern about the sale. Discussions about the issue are underway among top American officials at the Department of Energy, the State Department and the Treasury Department. Even before the bankruptcy, Westinghouse’s Japanese parent was already moving away from the business of building nuclear power plants, focusing instead on maintaining existing reactors and developing reactors. It follows a broad pattern in the business, as big companies reassess the viability of nuclear and the field of players shrinks. General Electric has pared its nuclear operations, while the French builder Areva is going through a major restructuring. China has been moving to fill the void, as it increasingly develops its nuclear abilities and pushes homegrown players to look for opportunities beyond their borders. But China’s increasing presence in nuclear energy has raised security concerns in some countries.",0,1174,23.959183673469386,49,0.3747870528109029,0,0,0,0,98.29878727470546,15.147318893485842,77.8366630530174,39.47326693749181,0.7938671209540034,0.022146507666098807,0.049403747870528106,0.02129471890971039,0.034071550255536626,0.012776831345826235,0.15502555366269166,0.007666098807495741,0.0008517887563884157,0.013628620102214651,0.10136286201022146,0.0008517887563884157,0.05536626916524702,0.0068143100511073255,0.002555366269165247,0.017035775127768313,0.00596252129471891,0.065587734241908,0.0017035775127768314,0.05792163543441227,0.019591141396933562,0.03151618398637138,0,0.0008517887563884157,0.013628620102214651,0.0068143100511073255,0.12350936967632027,0,0.0017035775127768314,0.0017035775127768314,0.0008517887563884157,0,0.015332197614991482,0.03833049403747871,0.002555366269165247,0.002555366269165247,0.41056218057921634,0.002555366269165247,0.013628620102214651,0.0034071550255536627,0,0.03747870528109029,0.0008517887563884157,0.0017035775127768314,0.004258943781942078,0.010221465076660987,0.0034071550255536627,0.036626916524701875,0.041737649063032366,0.028960817717206135,0.0034071550255536627,0.012776831345826235,0.0008517887563884157,0,0.011073253833049404,0.17802385008517888,0.004258943781942078,0,0.022998296422487224,0.06388415672913117,0.10732538330494037,0.02129471890971039,0.020442930153321975,0.08517887563884156,0.15843270868824533,0.05877342419080068,0.016183986371379896,0,0.013628620102214651,0.151618398637138,0,0.004258943781942078,0.008517887563884156,0.0008517887563884157,0.007666098807495741,0,0,0.014480408858603067,0.09114139693356048,0.08006814310051108,0,0.019591141396933562,0.004258943781942078,0.04088586030664395,0.09540034071550256,0.09540034071550256,0.002555366269165247,0.08773424190800681,0,14,0,48.35,0,7,16,10,7,26.83,52.35,26.7,8,23,3.5,14,0,97.53,34,108.19999999999999,236.73,97.53,,0.3090169943749474,0,0.6069930240018798,0,0.1827439976315568,0.33823097646402334,0.24210172369314836,0.1827439976315568,0.46151238149087587,0.6257848333607802,0.46030552951750736,0.2035366959388389,0.4235341214078321,0.10056040392403998,0.3239394374502726,0,0.07301625328472071,0.025454245992827893,0.08100439460070523,0.17722893099653372,-0.32524594089443354,0.8227710690034663,75
78,"Pew Research Center’s national survey on the overall trust of the American people in the federal government is “near historic lows,” with just 20 percent saying they trust it to do what’s right “always or most of the time. ”[Those that trust the government “some of the time” is much higher  —   68 percent  —   and 11 percent said they “never trust the government. ”  Pew points out in the article accompanying the survey results that a shift in power at the White House and Republican control in both chambers of Congress has shifted perspectives of the government: The changes in the dynamics of power in Washington have registered with members of both political parties. Somewhat more Republicans express trust in government today than did so prior to the election, while views among Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. For the first time since George W. Bush’s presidency, Republicans (28%) are more likely than Democrats (15%) to say they can trust the government in Washington to do the right thing just about always or most of the time. The number of Americans who describe their feeling toward the federal government as “frustrated” were in the majority at 55 percent. This compares with 22 percent who chose “angry” and only 19 percent who said they are “basically content. ” Confidence in the country’s future also reflects partisan attitudes, Pew reported.  Overall, 41 percent of Americans say they have “quite a lot” of confidence in the future of the U. S. while 30% have some confidence. The number who say they have “little or no confidence” is 28 percent, up from 15 percent in the fall of 2015.

79,"Former National Guardsman turned Islamic State sympathizer Mohamed Jalloh of Sterling, Virginia pled to guilty in federal court Thursday to a terrorism charge related to a July arrested during an FBI sting operation.Jalloh, a 27 year old naturalized citizen from Sierra Leone was arrested on July 3rd as part of an FBI counterterrorism operation in which he had communicated to a federal informant that he was interested in participating in a “Fort Hood ” style attack.Jalloh was apprehended by federal agents after purchasing a Stag Arms rifle at a Virginia arms dealer that had been rendered inoperable as part of the operation.According to the U.S. Attorney’s office , authorities discovered during their operation that Jalloh was attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State by “assisting in the procurement of weapons” to be used in an attack on U.S. soil.Following his arrest, Jalloh admitted to traveling to Africa to join the Islamic State, adding that he had quit the National Guard after listening to online lectures from deceased al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Aulaqi.Via Justice.Gov …in March 2016, a now-deceased member of ISIL brokered an introduction between Jalloh, 26, of Sterling, Virginia, and an individual in the United States who actually was an FBI confidential human source (CHS). The ISIL member was actively plotting an attack in the United States and believed the attack would be carried out with the assistance of Jalloh and the CHS.…Jalloh stated that he recently had taken a six-month trip to Africa, where he had met with ISIL members in Nigeria and first began communicating online with the ISIL member who later brokered his introduction to the CHS.During their meeting, Jalloh also told the CHS that he often thought about conducting an attack and that he knew how to shoot guns. Jalloh praised the gunman who killed five U.S. military members in a terrorist attack in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 2015, and stated that he had been thinking about conducting an attack similar to the November 2009 attack at Ft. Hood, Texas.During the May 2016 meeting, Jalloh asked the CHS about the timeline for an operation and commented that it was better to plan an operation for the month of Ramadan. Jalloh also asked if the CHS could assist him in providing a donation to ISIL. Ultimately, Jalloh provided a prepaid cash transfer of $500 to a contact of the CHS that Jalloh believed was a member of ISIL, but who was in fact an undercover FBI employee.During federal court Thursday Jalloh’s attorney , Joe Flood, stated that the defense plans to “ provide context ” during a February sentencing hearing in an effort to explain the defendant’s actions and what lead to his decisions.Jalloh currently faces up to 20 years in federal prison.",1,474,52.666666666666664,9,0.379746835443038,0,0,0,0,98.77560232953941,9.952370735893586,85.42846183352513,4.435355465329194,0.7531645569620253,0.02109704641350211,0.02531645569620253,0.023206751054852322,0.04219409282700422,0.027426160337552744,0.12658227848101267,0.02109704641350211,0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,0.11181434599156118,0,0.046413502109704644,0.02531645569620253,0.006329113924050633,0.008438818565400843,0.002109704641350211,0.046413502109704644,0,0.04430379746835443,0.0189873417721519,0.03164556962025317,0.008438818565400843,0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,0.0949367088607595,0,0,0,0,0,0.006329113924050633,0.06751054852320675,0.004219409282700422,0.004219409282700422,0.4409282700421941,0.012658227848101266,0.004219409282700422,0,0,0.0379746835443038,0.006329113924050633,0,0.02109704641350211,0.016877637130801686,0.004219409282700422,0.02531645569620253,0.010548523206751054,0.016877637130801686,0,0.03164556962025317,0.006329113924050633,0,0.02531645569620253,0.16877637130801687,0.004219409282700422,0.002109704641350211,0.004219409282700422,0.04852320675105485,0.06751054852320675,0.035864978902953586,0.010548523206751054,0.04008438818565401,0.17088607594936708,0.07383966244725738,0.006329113924050633,0,0.012658227848101266,0.1371308016877637,0.008438818565400843,0.006329113924050633,0.008438818565400843,0,0,0,0.006329113924050633,0.02531645569620253,0.10548523206751055,0.056962025316455694,0,0.006329113924050633,0.004219409282700422,0.06329113924050633,0.09282700421940929,0.0949367088607595,0,0.04219409282700422,0.006329113924050633,8,0,55,0,0,7,0,3,1.83,46,2,0,2,0,8,1,13.83,8,102,121.83,13.83,,0.37354536999991295,0,0.8039007266871948,0,0,0.3428614889693982,0,0.1827439976315568,0.12002827263995351,0.7741969205630465,0.12973190755680383,0,0.12973190755680383,0,0.3428614889693982,0.06936540706703205,0.02439884974330928,0.014113579027221565,0.17994813259707496,0.2149321666108004,-0.9028554102056642,0.7850678333891996,29
80,"Follow on Facebook Print This Post CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT The nationwide boycott of all Carlton United Brewery products reached new heights over the weekend, after it was revealed that a camp of ringers in Queensland’s Channel Country have only been drinking Sauvignon Blanc for the last five weeks. They join a growing political movement of punters that are abstaining from drinking any of Australia’s highest-selling beer brands, in a showing of support for 55 workers who lost their jobs at Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) in June. These men and women are also known as the #CUB55. The maintenance workers lost their jobs after CUB terminated a machine maintenance contract with employer Quant, they were then offered their jobs back again at a 65% lower wage, after penalty rates and other entitlements. E.H Pearson Cattle Company ‘s head stockman, Ronnie Austin says although he and his mates often punch on with the unionised Betoota shearing contractors, joining the CUB Boycott was a “no fucking brainer”. “I’m usually not a big supporter of the Unions, but you can’t carry on the way these blokes have been” “It’s fucking crook, mate” Austin says it’s been hard work trying to avoid getting stuck into a few green demons at knock off after pushing cattle all day, but it’s their duty as fellow workers to support the CUB 55. “It’s been tough. But we are all starting to get around the lively fruit flavours of the Jacob’s Creek Sauvignon Blanc” “The passionfruit and citrus prevail across the palate, which is pretty much enhanced by the fresh natural acidity which provides vibrancy and length on the finish” With the Mount Isa New Years Eve Rodeo as the next big event pencilled in on their calendars, Austin says the Betoota boys are prepared to throw down with anyone who questions their choice of drink. “If CUB haven’t sorted this mess out by then, well yes of course we will still be drinking white wine on New Years Eve” “If anyone has problem with it then they can come and talk to me and Rocko. It won’t be the first time we’ve had to bust heads in the Isa” “In fact anyone who wants to drink VB around me better have a note from their doctor because It’s just bloody unaustralian” It seems the CUB boycott has travelled across all cultures and state borders in Australia, with workers unions in Brisbane marching as well as hipster musicians now being forced to choose between supported the workers and drinking Melbourne Bitter ironically.

Anthony List (SBA List) is featuring a photo of President Donald Trump’s letter to   leaders, expressing his gratitude for their efforts to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court:  Here’s the letter @POTUS sent us thanking Susan B. Anthony List members for taking action to #ConfirmGorsuch #ProLife pic. twitter.   —   Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017,  Congratulations to our new Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch  thank you @POTUS for nominating him! #ProLife #ConfirmGorsuch 🎉🎈🍾 pic. twitter.   —   Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017,  The Senate’s vote to confirm Gorsuch comes one day after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to change the procedural rules of the chamber and end the Democrats’ filibuster of Trump’s nominee. “The swift fulfillment of President Trump’s commitment to appoint   Supreme Court justices is a tremendous win for the   movement,” said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. “Susan B. Anthony List has been rallying the   grassroots behind Judge Gorsuch’s nomination for months, including rallies in seven states where   came out in force to urge their Senators to confirm Gorsuch. ” Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, also applauds Gorsuch’s confirmation: We were pleased to support Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, as were our grassroots activists from across America who sent thousands of messages to their Senators in support of his nomination. We thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for remaining steadfast throughout this process and President Trump for keeping his promise to the American people in nominating a   Justice to the Supreme Court. ”The March for Life congratulates Judge Neil #Gorsuch on his historic confirmation to the Supreme Court today.” https:  .   —   March for Life (@March_for_Life) April 7, 2017,  In exit poll reporting in November, CNN observed that 70 percent of voters said appointments to the Supreme Court were important to their vote, with 56 percent of Trump voters stating they were the most important factor. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also hailed the Senate’s vote to confirm Gorsuch. “Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation is Exhibit A for the argument that advocates for life and religious liberty need to vote,” said Pavone. “Without the active participation of social conservatives in last year’s elections, today we would be looking at a Supreme Court dominated by extreme   justices. Instead, there’s great hope for the future. ” Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Supreme Court vacancy after the sudden death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia “became a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election. ” “President Trump made history by telling voters who he would appoint to the Court by providing a list  —   the American people chose him and he in turn chose from the list, keeping his promise,” Perkins added. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said Gorsuch’s confirmation is “a huge win for the Trump administration and for the   movement. ” “Students for Life commends President Trump for keeping his promise to appoint a judge in the mold of the late Justice Scalia, and we look forward to the day when abortion on demand, in all nine months of pregnancy is no longer the law of the land,” she said. Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser with The Catholic Association, said Gorsuch’s confirmation will help to correct the “alarming erosion” of the First Amendment right to practice one’s faith without discrimination. “Senate Republicans have restored the true tradition of confirming justices without filibusters and the   of recent years,” she added.",0,614,23.615384615384617,26,0.3729641693811075,0.004885993485342019,0,0.008143322475570033,0,99,3.074342270107743,83.9871335504886,93.92021605574568,0.7133550488599348,0.021172638436482084,0.026058631921824105,0.016286644951140065,0.05374592833876222,0.02768729641693811,0.1970684039087948,0.003257328990228013,0.0016286644951140066,0.026058631921824105,0.08469055374592833,0,0.029315960912052116,0.019543973941368076,0,0.006514657980456026,0.011400651465798045,0.03745928338762215,0.004885993485342019,0.048859934853420196,0.011400651465798045,0.019543973941368076,0,0.0016286644951140066,0.006514657980456026,0.006514657980456026,0.13517915309446255,0.0016286644951140066,0.004885993485342019,0,0.003257328990228013,0,0.004885993485342019,0.03257328990228013,0,0,0.3534201954397394,0.017915309446254073,0.011400651465798045,0.0016286644951140066,0,0.008143322475570033,0.014657980456026058,0.0016286644951140066,0.004885993485342019,0.006514657980456026,0.008143322475570033,0.017915309446254073,0,0.019543973941368076,0.006514657980456026,0.004885993485342019,0.014657980456026058,0,0.024429967426710098,0.14332247557003258,0.02768729641693811,0.006514657980456026,0.019543973941368076,0.04234527687296417,0.06188925081433225,0.04071661237785016,0.048859934853420196,0.09446254071661238,0.16286644951140064,0.048859934853420196,0.014657980456026058,0,0.03908794788273615,0.11237785016286644,0.006514657980456026,0.013029315960912053,0.0016286644951140066,0,0.008143322475570033,0,0.003257328990228013,0.019543973941368076,0.0993485342019544,0.043973941368078175,0,0.003257328990228013,0.008143322475570033,0.05211726384364821,0.0732899022801303,0.0732899022801303,0.011400651465798045,0.04560260586319218,0.0016286644951140066,31.73,0,11,0,2,0,14,2,23.93,11,33.730000000000004,32.6,18,0,31.73,6,107.05999999999999,20,21,145.06,107.05999999999999,,0.5818440968060279,0,0.3254100088265923,0,0.08063375388365411,0,0.38039851551777354,0.08063375388365411,0.5120522889691607,0.3254100088265923,0.5966373022614899,0.5884103891874163,0.44113853589637586,0,0.2597106754733818,0.20830795663614993,0.15056394678367507,0.028127021629679637,0.029533372711163616,0.2040052878800664,0.8422019675071604,0.7959947121199336,48

84,"Valentina Sampaio is one of those leggy, lush brunette models for which Brazil is famous. And it was her striking beauty and “sparkling personality,” the French Vogue editor Emmanuelle Alt said, that led her to feature the    on the magazine’s March cover. Ms. Alt wrote in her editor’s letter that transgender people are “the ultimate of a rejection of conformity”  —   the sort of “icons that Vogue supports and chooses to celebrate. ” French Vogue is not the first fashion magazine to feature a transgender model on its cover. Hari Nef appeared on Frische, a   fashion and art magazine, in 2014 Andreja Pejić was on Marie Claire Spain a year ago and Ms. Sampaio on Elle Brazil last October, to name a few. But the action was groundbreaking for the Vogue empire as well as the French fashion establishment, in part because of the cover line  —   “Transgender beauty: How it’s shaking up the world”  —   below Ms. Sampaio’s face. Ms. Alt wrote that being transgender “is a detail one would prefer not to have to mention,” adding that Ms. Sampaio was not on the cover only for her looks “but because despite herself she embodies an   arduous struggle to be recognized and not be perceived as something Other, a gender exile. ” French Vogue’s editorial choices have long pushed social limits. In the 1970s, it published sexually charged images by Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton, most notably Mr. Newton’s 1979 picture of Gia Carangi, fashion’s first openly lesbian model, wearing an Yves Saint Laurent evening gown and being seduced by an androgynous woman in a Saint Laurent tuxedo. (It is worth noting that Ms. Sampaio greatly resembles Ms. Carangi.) In 2007, Carine Roitfeld, then the French Vogue editor, ran a Bruce   cover of the   blonde Carolyn Murphy horsing around with Andre J. a black, bearded androgynous model who was wearing a   mini trench. Still, the fact that the current issue reached newsstands the same week that President Trump reversed federal policy protecting some rights of transgender students  —   and during a French presidential campaign in which   populism looms  —   made Ms. Alt’s cover statement that much more pointed. Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman and chief executive of Condé Nast International, the parent company of French Vogue, called the cover a brilliant decision. “It reinforces the power of the Vogue brand as a bold, innovative and highly relevant voice in the worlds of journalism and fashion,” Mr. Newhouse said. “I am not aware of any commercial impact, either positive or negative. My impression is a lot of people liked it. ” Olivier Lalanne, the magazine’s deputy editor, said the public response had been “positive and encouraging” with “no backlash at all for the moment. ” Ms. Sampaio concurred. “I’ve only had supercool feedback,” she said last week. On her Instagram feed, @valentts, her following has shot up by several thousand to more than 53, 000, and the Vogue cover image has received laudatory comments such as “You are beautiful,” “History made” and “#finally. ” It helps that Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the photographers who shot the cover and its accompanying fashion story, were careful to avoid clichés or fetishizing Ms. Sampaio. The magazine published two cover versions: In one, Ms. Sampaio shimmers in a gold lamé Saint Laurent evening gown, her   eyes piercing a haunting violet light in the second, a   she is bathed in a flare of fuchsia. For the fashion spread, Ms. Alt dressed Ms. Sampaio in a series of sexy 1970s throwbacks, such as a Louis Vuitton   sheer black gown over a black cutout bodysuit a Balenciaga red poppy print blouse and skintight pants and a pair of slouchy Dolce  Gabbana leopard print sequined pants, her naked torso and modest breasts painted gold. “It’s not gratuitous,” Mr. Lalanne said. “It makes sense as a story, therefore it doesn’t shock. ” Ms. Sampaio, who grew up in Aquiraz, a fishing town in northern Brazil, said, “I always felt like a girl. ” She refused to reveal what her name was before she chose Valentina, or when she transitioned, but did allow that her father, a fisherman, and her mother, a schoolteacher, “were always supportive and are very proud” of her choice. Her schoolmates accepted her, too, “since they already saw me as a little girl. ” She was studying fashion when she was discovered by a makeup artist a few years ago and signed by a modeling agency based in São Paulo. At first, there were a few “incidents,” as she puts it  —   clients who refused to hire her because she was transgender  —   and she considered giving up her new career. But after other transgender models, like Ms. Pejić, Ms. Nef and Lea T, Riccardo Tisci’s muse, moved firmly into the fashion mainstream, Ms. Sampaio found herself working steadily for magazines and on the runways. Last year, L’Oréal produced a short film about Ms. Sampaio, which it released on International Women’s Day. She is now one of the brand’s ambassadors. It was Mr. Alas and Mr. Piggott who brought Ms. Sampaio to the attention of Ms. Alt and Mr. Lalanne. “They found her beautiful,” Mr. Lalanne said. “And we agreed. ” Ms. Sampaio traveled to London for the shoot in December and had no idea it included the cover until she was on the set. “For Vogue to shine a light on someone who changed her sex when it is such a hotly debated topic projects a calming image of tolerance,” Mr. Lalanne said. “Fashion is freer than other domains in the arts. It opens doors, and we are able to highlight people who are social antagonists. So we have. ” As for Ms. Alt, she said she longed for the day when a transgender person “poses on the front cover of a fashion magazine and it is no longer necessary to write an editorial on the subject. ” Only then, she said, “will we know that the battle is won. ”",0,993,22.066666666666666,45,0.31722054380664655,0,0,0.0010070493454179255,0,89.05963301552426,5.835310133900265,83.31918429003021,54.203346502440155,0.7341389728096677,0.00906344410876133,0.03927492447129909,0.023162134944612285,0.03121852970795569,0.014098690835850957,0.22457200402819738,0.0030211480362537764,0.0030211480362537764,0.016112789526686808,0.08962739174219536,0,0.05236656596173213,0.014098690835850957,0.007049345417925478,0.015105740181268883,0.007049345417925478,0.07150050352467271,0.002014098690835851,0.06948640483383686,0.022155085599194362,0.06143001007049345,0,0,0.02014098690835851,0.002014098690835851,0.08257804632426989,0,0.0030211480362537764,0.0010070493454179255,0.06445115810674723,0,0.0030211480362537764,0.05337361530715005,0.0030211480362537764,0.0030211480362537764,0.42900302114803623,0,0.011077542799597181,0.002014098690835851,0.005035246727089627,0.04833836858006042,0.0010070493454179255,0.0010070493454179255,0.02014098690835851,0.016112789526686808,0.016112789526686808,0.010070493454179255,0.0010070493454179255,0.012084592145015106,0.011077542799597181,0.008056394763343404,0,0.0010070493454179255,0.017119838872104734,0.18126888217522658,0.00906344410876133,0.0010070493454179255,0.03726082578046324,0.07452165156092648,0.04934541792547835,0.04833836858006042,0.023162134944612285,0.05337361530715005,0.11782477341389729,0.09667673716012085,0.016112789526686808,0,0.05236656596173213,0.10876132930513595,0.0030211480362537764,0.005035246727089627,0.0030211480362537764,0.0010070493454179255,0.023162134944612285,0,0.008056394763343404,0.03625377643504532,0.12789526686807653,0.054380664652567974,0,0.011077542799597181,0.002014098690835851,0.0433031218529708,0.09566968781470292,0.09768378650553877,0.004028197381671702,0.028197381671701913,0.0010070493454179255,79.625,0,27,0,13,0,18,6,20,14,3,9,20.6,0,79.625,0,133.225,20.8,59,208.025,133.225,,0.7263397947548461,0,0.47368421052631576,0,0.3023255813953488,0,0.375,0.16666666666666666,0.4,0.3181818181818182,0.09090909090909091,0.23076923076923078,0.4071146245059289,0,0.3617021276595745,0,0.11665681574396355,0.018213261531052297,0.051662616842888726,0.18215450624986318,0.7777283868308406,0.8178454937501368,59
85,"WASHINGTON  —   Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that people on the terror watch list should be barred from buying firearms, putting himself in the center of a   debate in Congress revived by the worst mass shooting in United States history. Mr. Trump’s stance, expressed in a Twitter post, does not necessarily jibe with the positions of the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association, whose endorsement Mr. Trump frequently boasts about on the campaign trail. His tweet could be read to support measures pushed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans in Congress, reflecting the unusual nuances of the issue, which touches on public safety and civil rights beyond the Second Amendment. “I will be meeting with the N. R. A. who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the   list, to buy guns,” Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote Wednesday morning on Twitter. His comment came three days after 49 people were killed when a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State stormed an Orlando nightclub. On the same morning, a group of Democrats took to the Senate floor in a filibuster to protest the lack of improvement in gun safety measures in recent years. “I’ve had enough,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who spoke on and off for more than 14 hours. “I couldn’t just come back to the Senate this week and pretend like this is business as usual. ” When he finished talking shortly after 2 a. m. on Thursday, Mr. Murphy said he had secured agreement for votes on the measures. “I am proud to announce that after 14+ hours on the floor, we will have a vote on closing the terror gap  universal background checks,” Mr. Murphy said in a Twitter message posted around 1:50 a. m. The filibuster drew significant attention online, with supporters tweeting support and encouragement as the hours dragged on. Mr. Murphy acknowledged that support after ending the filibuster. “This would never have happened without you,” he said in a separate Twitter post. “Without your outpouring of support  —   your calls, tweets  emails. ” The Democratic legislation, sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, would seek to prevent individuals on the government’s terror watch list from purchasing guns on the recommendation of the Justice Department alone. Ms. Feinstein unsuccessfully proposed a similar measure last year, after 14 people were killed by an Islamic extremist couple in San Bernardino, Calif. The legislation she is now proposing goes even further, covering not just people on the watch list at the time of purchase, but anyone who had been on the list in the preceding five years. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, had been on the list but was removed after an F. B. I. investigation turned up no evidence that he was plotting any crimes. N. R. A. officials said on Twitter that they would be happy to meet with Mr. Trump, but that the group had not changed its position: withholding guns from people on the terrorist watch list, the vast majority of whom have not been charged with a crime, would give the government too much power to deny people of their Second Amendment right. At one point in 2014, the list had 800, 000 names, and in the past famous Americans like Senator Ted Kennedy and Representative John Lewis had undergone additional screening at airports because their names were similar to those on the list. The group has supported a competing measure put forward by Republicans, led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas. Under the proposal, when someone on the watch list tried to buy a gun, federal prosecutors would have three days to persuade a judge that there is probable cause to deny the purchase. Democrats say that burden is too high. “The N. R. A. believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period,” said Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the group’s Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement. “At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow   Americans who are wrongly put on a watch list to be removed. ” A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump confirmed that he met with Mr. Cox in New York on Tuesday, though the terror watch list was not on the agenda. Mr. Trump’s campaign did not clarify Wednesday how far his proposal would go or articulate which of the dueling measures  —   Mr. Cornyn’s or Ms. Feinstein’s  —   Mr. Trump most agrees with. Democrats were not counting on Mr. Trump’s support and almost seemed not to want it. They have been more than happy to associate him with the N. R. A. which Democrats view as the biggest obstacle to gun control. Republicans are under pressure to show some action in response to the Orlando shooting, and Mr. Cornyn said on Wednesday evening that he was working with Ms. Feinstein on a potential compromise. But Ms. Feinstein, speaking to reporters after a classified briefing on the Orlando shooting that Mr. Cornyn also attended, said she doubted a deal would be reached. As for Mr. Trump’s role, she was dismissive. “Oh, Trump just makes everything worse,” Ms. Feinstein said. During the primaries, Mr. Trump, who is a gun owner, spoke often about his affinity for guns as a way to prove his conservatism. He is in step with the N. R. A. on virtually all other gun issues, including his opposition to a ban on assault weapons. “By the way, I’m going to save your Second Amendment,” he said Wednesday at a rally in Atlanta. As he has after other mass shootings, Mr. Trump said Wednesday that more gun ownership was the answer, not less. He said that the carnage could have been minimized “if some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction. ” Actual floor debate on any of the proposals in Congress was not expected until Thursday at the earliest. Mr. Murphy was aided by a large cast of Democrats but especially his fellow Connecticut senator, Richard Blumenthal, as well as Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the minority whip. They yielded briefly for questions from Republicans but otherwise talked incessantly about the need for tighter gun control. By early evening, the Democrats brought out a poster showing photographs of victims of the Orlando shooting. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, stood next to the poster, reading out the victims’ names and speaking about their lives. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said that the speechmaking by Democrats was merely delaying the consideration of the   measures, as well as proposals on F. B. I. financing and other amendments to the Senate appropriations bill. Jonathan Lowy, director of the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that while the Democratic legislation was “a very promising step in the right direction,” none of the proposals currently under consideration go far enough. “We need to require background checks for all gun sales if we truly want to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and other dangerous people,” Mr. Lowy said. Mr. Lowy added that he still does not entirely understand what Mr. Trump is proposing. “You certainly can’t enact the tweet into law  —   you need more specifics than that,” he said. “We’ll have to see what actual legislation, if any, Trump actually supports. ”",0,1271,16.088607594936708,79,0.31943351691581434,0,0,0,0,95.82512443244596,22.779915599742512,76.54059080180245,27.077970102281665,0.7883556254917388,0.006294256490952006,0.043273013375295044,0.029110936270653028,0.04012588512981904,0.020456333595594022,0.1841070023603462,0.003933910306845004,0.007867820613690008,0.011014948859166011,0.0967741935483871,0,0.06136900078678206,0.003933910306845004,0.0023603461841070024,0.010228166797797011,0.00865460267505901,0.09284028324154209,0.0015735641227380016,0.06058221872541306,0.03147128245476003,0.03933910306845004,0,0.0015735641227380016,0.03383162863886703,0.01966955153422502,0.10464201416207711,0,0,0.0023603461841070024,0.006294256490952006,0,0.006294256490952006,0.05507474429583006,0.0007867820613690008,0.0007867820613690008,0.45712037765538943,0.0007867820613690008,0.01966955153422502,0,0.006294256490952006,0.03933910306845004,0.011801730920535013,0.0007867820613690008,0.013375295043273014,0.013375295043273014,0.007081038552321007,0.03461841070023604,0.00944138473642801,0.021243115656963022,0.015735641227380016,0.01966955153422502,0.00944138473642801,0.0023603461841070024,0.011801730920535013,0.2037765538945712,0.004720692368214005,0,0.03225806451612903,0.08261211644374508,0.03855232100708104,0.03933910306845004,0.020456333595594022,0.06766325727773406,0.16050354051927615,0.07867820613690008,0.01809598741148702,0,0.023603461841070025,0.15027537372147914,0.0015735641227380016,0.0023603461841070024,0.00944138473642801,0.0015735641227380016,0.010228166797797011,0,0,0.01888276947285602,0.12037765538945712,0.08103855232100708,0,0.01966955153422502,0.006294256490952006,0.04956726986624705,0.11801730920535011,0.12037765538945712,0.003147128245476003,0.022029897718332022,0.004720692368214005,11.875,0,107.5,1,5,0,14.275,18,6.08,183.5,6.125,26.375,39.375,0,11.875,0,88.955,16.275,262.5,360.47999999999996,88.955,,0.23002771605206276,0,0.7300548315664067,0.024540350746487385,0.11173380652316264,0,0.264233368490326,0.3116925548699558,0.13266646953022784,0.8219513827305002,0.1335172744947964,0.398870526738134,0.4976352761651843,0,0.4044991461515825,0,0.05785766318911465,0.010585503551265706,0.17073392824622108,0.234461586492182,-0.8606165711375772,0.765538413507818,94
86,"How the Oligarchy Has Prepared the Groundwork for Stealing the Election In addition to the cyber manipulation of electronic voting (see http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/11/01/very-easy-to-invisibly-steal-us-elections/ ), Finian Cunningham explains a second method the Oligarchy has prepared that would allow the election to be stolen for Hillary. The groundwork that has been officially established indicates that a false flag cyber attack is the preferred method.A Digital 9/11 If Trump Wins by Finian Cunningham There are disturbing signs that a digital 9/11 false flag terror attack is being readied for election day in the US to ensure that Donald Trump does not win. Such an attack – involving widespread internet and power outage – would have nothing to do with Russia or any other foreign state. It would be furnished by agencies of the US Deep State in a classic “false flag” covert manner. But the resulting chaos and “assault on American democracy” will be conveniently blamed on Russia. That presents a double benefit. Russia would be further demonized as a foreign aggressor “justifying” even harsher counter measures by America and its European allies against Moscow. Secondly, a digital attack on America’s presidential election day this week, would allow the Washington establishment to pronounce a Trump win invalid due to “Russian cyber subversion”. Invalidation is a prepared option if the ballot results show Republican candidate Donald Trump as the imminent victor. Democrat rival Hillary Clinton is the clear choice for the White House among the Washington establishment. She has the backing of Wall Street finance capital, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex and the Deep State agencies of the Pentagon and CIA. The fix has been in for months to get her elected by the powers-that-be owing to her well-groomed obedience to American imperialist interests. The billionaire property magnate Trump is too much of a maverick to be entrusted with the White House, as far as the American ruling elite are concerned. The trouble is that, despite the massive campaign to discredit Trump, polls show his support remains stubbornly close to Clinton’s. The latter has been tainted with too many scandals involving allegations of sleazy dealings with Wall Street, so-called pay-for-play favors while she was former Secretary of State, and her penchant for inciting overseas wars for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot-soldiers. As one headline from McClatchy News only days ago put it: “Majority of voters think Clinton acted illegally, new poll finds”. http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article112635048.html#emlnl=Evening_Newsletter Trump is right. The US presidential election is rigged. The system is heavily stacked against any candidate who does not conform with the interests of the establishment. The massive media-orchestrated campaign against Trump is testimony to that. But such is popular disgust with Clinton, her sleaze-ball husband Bill and the Washington establishment that her victory is far from certain. Indeed in the last week before voting this Tuesday various polls are showing a neck-and-neck race with even some indicators putting the Republican narrowly ahead. Over the weekend, the Washington Post, which has been one of the main media outlets panning Trump on a daily basis, reported this: “The electoral map is definitely moving in Trump’s direction”. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/dont-look-now-the-electoral-map-is-definitely-moving-in-donald-trumps-direction/?wpisrc=nl_headlines&wpmm=1 In recent days, American media are reporting a virtual state of emergency by the US government and its security agencies to thwart what they claim are Russian efforts to incite “election day cyber mayhem.” In one “exclusive” report by the NBC network on November 3, it was claimed that: “The US government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week’s presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling.” http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw On November 4, the Washington Post reported: “Intelligence officials warn of Russian mischief in election and beyond.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-seen-as-unable-to-alter-election-but-may-still-seek-to-undermine-it/2016/11/03/b7387160-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html Apparently, the emergency security response is being coordinated by the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, according to NBC. These claims of Russian state hackers interfering in the US political system are not new. Last month, the Obama administration officially accused Moscow of this alleged malfeasance. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election Russian President Vladimir Putin has lambasted American claims that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential elections as “hysterical nonsense”, aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep-rooted internal problems. http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-rejects-claims-russian-interference-us-election-43103312 The Obama administration and its state security agencies have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegations against Russia. Nevertheless the repeated charges have a tendency to stick. The Clinton campaign has for months been accusing Trump of being a “pro-Russian stooge”. Clinton’s campaign has also claimed that Russian hackers have colluded with the whistleblower organization Wikileaks to release thousands of private emails damaging Clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of Trump. Wikileaks’ director Julian Assange and the Russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating, or that they are working to get Trump elected. But on the eve of the election, the US authorities are recklessly pushing hysteria that Russia is trying to subvert American democracy. Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted as saying: “The Russians are in an offensive mode and the US is working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels.” NBC cites a senior Obama administration official as saying that the Russians “want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process”. Ominously, the news outlet adds that “steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet.” Nearly two weeks ago, on October 21-22, the US was hit with a widespread internet outage. The actors behind the “distributed denial of service” were not identified, but the disruption was nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer services. One former official at the US Department of Homeland Security described the event as having “all the signs of what would be considered a drill”. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm_tw Could that cyber-attack have been the work of US Deep State agencies as a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for November 8 – election day? The Washington establishment wants Clinton over Trump. She’s the marionette of choice for their strategic interests, including a more hostile foreign policy towards Russia in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. But Trump might prove to be the voters’ choice. In which case, the shadowy forces that really rule America can trigger a “digital 9/11”. It’s not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout, power, transport, banking and communications paralysis – even for just a temporary period of a few hours. Months of fingering Russia as a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in US democracy to get “Comrade Trump” into the White House would then serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. In that event, the US authorities could plausibly move to declare the election of Donald J Trump null and void. In fact the scenario could be contrived to a far more serious level than merely invalidating the election result. The US authorities could easily feign that a state of emergency is necessary in order to “defend national security”. That contingency catapults beyond “rigged politics”. It is a green light for a coup d’état by the Deep State forces who found that they could not win through the “normal” rigging methods.Originally published: https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201611061047117877-digital-9-11-if-trump-wins/ The post How the Oligarchy Has Prepared the Groundwork for Stealing the Election appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .",1,1269,23.5,54,0.39322301024428685,0,0,0,0.0070921985815602835,95.93483631018758,6.815902085764727,60.57413469115596,20.955432974345506,0.7265563435776202,0.018124507486209612,0.05279747832939322,0.02048857368006304,0.04728132387706856,0.015760441292356184,0.1457840819542947,0.01103230890464933,0.002364066193853428,0.007880220646178092,0.10559495665878645,0.0007880220646178094,0.07486209613869188,0.003940110323089046,0.0031520882584712374,0.015760441292356184,0.0070921985815602835,0.08274231678486997,0.004728132387706856,0.03230890464933018,0.02206461780929866,0.0425531914893617,0.014972419227738377,0.0007880220646178094,0.02206461780929866,0.014184397163120567,0.10007880220646179,0,0.0007880220646178094,0.0007880220646178094,0.006304176516942475,0,0.009456264775413711,0.016548463356973995,0.0007880220646178094,0.0007880220646178094,0.4326241134751773,0.0007880220646178094,0.002364066193853428,0.0031520882584712374,0,0.037825059101654845,0.0015760441292356187,0,0.013396375098502758,0.006304176516942475,0.003940110323089046,0.002364066193853428,0.004728132387706856,0.006304176516942475,0.006304176516942475,0.02442868400315209,0,0.0007880220646178094,0.018912529550827423,0.18912529550827423,0.005516154452324665,0.0007880220646178094,0.01260835303388495,0.04412923561859732,0.04728132387706856,0.026004728132387706,0.02127659574468085,0.05673758865248227,0.13711583924349882,0.06382978723404255,0.014972419227738377,0.0007880220646178094,0.03467297084318361,0.10717100078802207,0.0015760441292356187,0.01182033096926714,0.01103230890464933,0.0007880220646178094,0.009456264775413711,0,0,0.007880220646178092,0.0425531914893617,0.05988967691095351,0,0.018912529550827423,0.005516154452324665,0.037825059101654845,0.08747044917257683,0.1008668242710796,0.01260835303388495,0.036249014972419225,0,17.625,4,143.625,1,22,35.25,9,61.5,2.83,105.875,37,18,20.475,1.75,17.625,0,127.42,46.25,278.375,434.91999999999996,127.42,,0.34909040987732576,0.10850884755755627,0.813793075815835,0.02953044805404075,0.4009962683000323,0.5175196670608145,0.2149851662190087,0.6517360580279163,0.07928647006899331,0.7631271192642474,0.5296052676073745,0.353889367864523,0.38387011738325444,0.05055852223368807,0.4009962683000323,0,0.0800920222261333,0.029071229225856737,0.1749773715837377,0.2733764111331808,-0.8665967437998918,0.7266235888668192,113
87,"Ya hay más reencuentros de “Operación Triunfo” que ediciones de “Operación Triunfo” SE ESTÁN REENCONTRANDO COMPAÑEROS QUE AÚN NO SE CONOCEN Televisión Española La fiebre de los reencuentros de antiguos concursantes de “Operación Triunfo” ha llevado a Televisión Española a apostar por el formato de la nostalgia hasta el punto de que, según confirmaba el propio canal esta mañana, ya hay más ediciones de “OT: El reencuentro” que de “Operación Triunfo”. Un portavoz de la productora Gestmusic reconocía que “se están reencontrando cantantes que sólo se conocen desde hace dos días”. “El concierto de ayer fue mítico, hay que repetirlo. ¿Cómo lo tenéis mañana?”, preguntó ayer un ejecutivo del Ente público a Chenoa y David Bisbal, que confesaron estar hartos de reencontrarse tras 16 reencuentros consecutivos. “Yo necesito no reencontrarme con la misma gente tantas veces”, apuntó la cantante. Bisbal confesó tras las cámaras que, a estas alturas, los reencuentros merecen la pena no tanto por la ilusión “como por lo que se cobra”. “No sé quién es Julio Rojas porque me perdí el programa de ayer, pero dicen que esta noche se reencuentra con Vero, que tampoco sé quién es, y va a ser la bomba porque parece que hubo algo entre ellos casi desde que se conocieron hace menos de dos días”, comenta un seguidor acérrimo de este formato. TVE ha firmado ya la producción de doce ediciones de “Operación Triunfo” con doce reencuentros cada una. La imposibilidad de cuadrar la parrilla de programación ha llevado a celebrar el reencuentro de concursantes de una edición que aún no se había grabado. “Es muy emocionante reencontrarte con los compañeros a los que vas a conocer dentro de un mes”, explicaba Yuri Sedasso, ganador de la edición de OT de 2023.",1,291,26.454545454545453,11,0.3436426116838488,0,0,0,0,92.94200944498607,1,50,44.658556701030925,0.09965635738831616,0,0,0,0.010309278350515464,0,0.17525773195876287,0,0,0,0.027491408934707903,0,0,0,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0.006872852233676976,0.003436426116838488,0.048109965635738834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058419243986254296,0,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0.024054982817869417,0,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0,0,0.01718213058419244,0,0.024054982817869417,0,0.006872852233676976,0.010309278350515464,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0.03436426116838488,0.01718213058419244,0.013745704467353952,0.010309278350515464,0,0,0.013745704467353952,0,0.006872852233676976,0.08247422680412371,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.010309278350515464,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0.013745704467353952,0.010309278350515464,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,11.83,1.83,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,8.83,0,13.83,20.659999999999997,8.83,,0,0.16823313233447382,0,0,0,0,0,0.44369604171189886,0.10982813594193673,0,0,0,0.21239994067041815,0,0.11881849050177154,0,0.029271365113041174,0,0.045846317045680575,0.06848770138566598,-0.3228287342177362,0.931512298614334,10
88,"LONDON  —   If walls could talk, Chatsworth House, with its sublime Painted Hall, Sculpture Gallery and endless parade of gilded staterooms, would have some tales to tell. Considered one of the great treasure houses of England, set amid the rolling green hills of the Derbyshire Dales, the estate has played host over the last 500 years to some of Britain’s most captivating and infamous women, including: Bess of Hardwick Mary, Queen of Scots Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire Kathleen Kennedy, known as Kick (sister to John F. Kennedy) and Deborah Mitford, known as Debo. Their stories, and much more, will be revealed as part of an exhibition, “House Style: Five Centuries of Fashion at Chatsworth,” which opens to the public on Saturday. Curated by Hamish Bowles, international editor at large at American Vogue, and with creative direction and design by Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda, the exhibition will delve into Chatsworth’s rich sartorial heritage, using the lives of its   inhabitants and their glamorous guests as mannequins on which to hang stories of the wider history of the house. “To be let loose in the wardrobe rooms, the gold vaults, the muniment room and the closets, cupboards and attics of Chatsworth  —   a place I came to as a little boy with a ticket in my hand and wonder in my eyes  —   has been a truly joyous experience,” Mr. Bowles said recently in a telephone call from the stately home. Lady Laura Burlington, the    of the current Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, conceived of the exhibition while hunting for a christening robe. She found umpteen perfectly preserved options complete with capes, underdresses and bonnets, which led her to wonder what else might lie undiscovered. Six years later, Mr. Bowles has seen his curatorial vision become a reality. The exhibition is organized by theme, including Coronation Dress Bess of Hardwick and the Tudor Influence the Georgiana Effect and Country Living and Entertaining at Chatsworth, though a standout moment for him may be a reimagining of the Devonshire House Ball, situated in the grandest staterooms in the house. Held in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, the ball, with 400 guests dressed as allegorical figures (and, crucially, photographed) was the grandest fancy dress ball of the century. Assistant curators for the exhibition spent months tracking down a handful of the original costumes, bringing them together for the first time since the night of the party. Mr. Bowles gasped as he described a Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, gown made by the couturier   Worth for Louise, the formidable wife of the eighth duke, and arguably the jewel in the display’s crown. “So often,” Mr. Bowles said, “clothing is the most vivid entry point into getting a sense of how people of the past lived and existed in an environment or even a single moment in time. To create this exhibit on the landscape of Chatsworth, where so many legendary lives and moments have unfolded, has just been extraordinary. ” Lady Burlington, a former model and fashion buyer, said that her first meeting with Mr. Bowles was less than auspicious. “We met many years ago on an   fashion shoot for Harper’s and Queen,” Lady Burlington said, “where Hamish was the stylist, I was the model, and thanks to an overly snug Vivienne Westwood corset, I promptly fainted. ” Mr. Bowles helped revive her, she added, by giving her a cup of tea and a biscuit. Luckily, their next meeting proved more fruitful. Beyond the historical gems they unearthed, the exhibition is notable for its wealth of contemporary contributions, with garments from modern fashion labels like Alexander McQueen, Erdem, Maison Margiela, Vetements, Vivienne Westwood and Gucci, the exhibition’s principal sponsor. Last year, Gucci shot its 2017 cruise collection at Chatsworth, and the house clearly made its mark on the creative director Alessandro Michele, who said it was “unlike anywhere else in the world, full of charm and rituals. ” “You can see history everywhere,” Mr. Michele said, “yet everything is alive. ” The most recent Gucci runway collection was packed with what Lady Burlington termed “Chatsworth detail,” including fabrics, colors and bejeweled bugs and bees crawling over suiting and shirts. Given the calligraphy offerings on the Milan runway last month, Mr. Michele may also have been taken with the 11th duke’s trove of novelty slogan pullovers, printed with phrases like “Get Up and Do Something,” “Far Better Not” “All Passion Spent” and “Never Marry a Mitford. ” The duke’s wife, Debo Mitford (one of six Mitford sisters who dominated British high society in the 1930s) died in 2014, but she is represented in the exhibition. An ice pink satin “Carmel” gown she commissioned from Dior from its spring 1953 collection is a centerpiece of the show, while other highlights include her collection of bug and butterfly brooches and a pair of her favorite slippers, emblazoned with the image of Elvis Presley. Lady Burlington added wistfully that there might have been even more from the dowager duchess in the exhibition had she not willingly given away so many treasures. “Debo kept some things for sentimental reasons but generally thought nothing of passing clothes on,” she said. “As a result, her garments could turn up in the most unlikely of places. ” Lady Burlington recounted a story told by Charlotte Mosley about a time when the author had attended the local nativity performance alongside the duchess. The two had been sitting there for some time before the dowager suddenly sat upright in her chair, her eyes lit up. “Oh my goodness, I can’t believe it,” Lady Burlington said, repeating the account of the duchess’ reaction. “The Angel Gabriel is in my Givenchy!”",0,944,28.606060606060606,33,0.3463983050847458,0,0,0,0,96.95198360961072,15.604923325262313,79.26883239171374,75.00476694915254,0.7510593220338984,0.014830508474576272,0.046610169491525424,0.026483050847457626,0.03072033898305085,0.019067796610169493,0.1896186440677966,0.00211864406779661,0,0.01059322033898305,0.10063559322033898,0,0.04766949152542373,0.015889830508474576,0.005296610169491525,0.014830508474576272,0.01059322033898305,0.07521186440677965,0.00211864406779661,0.08686440677966102,0.02754237288135593,0.05826271186440678,0,0.00211864406779661,0.013771186440677966,0.00423728813559322,0.0635593220338983,0.001059322033898305,0.005296610169491525,0.0031779661016949155,0.038135593220338986,0,0.006355932203389831,0.05508474576271186,0.00211864406779661,0.00211864406779661,0.4258474576271186,0.006355932203389831,0.009533898305084746,0.011652542372881356,0.00847457627118644,0.023305084745762712,0.001059322033898305,0.0031779661016949155,0.015889830508474576,0.011652542372881356,0.020127118644067795,0.01694915254237288,0.009533898305084746,0.011652542372881356,0.005296610169491525,0.00211864406779661,0,0.001059322033898305,0.019067796610169493,0.19703389830508475,0.0031779661016949155,0.0031779661016949155,0.03177966101694915,0.0423728813559322,0.05402542372881356,0.034957627118644065,0.028601694915254237,0.03072033898305085,0.1483050847457627,0.05826271186440678,0.022245762711864406,0,0.04025423728813559,0.13453389830508475,0.0031779661016949155,0.009533898305084746,0,0,0.014830508474576272,0,0.001059322033898305,0.019067796610169493,0.10699152542372882,0.07415254237288135,0,0.024364406779661018,0.005296610169491525,0.048728813559322036,0.1016949152542373,0.1059322033898305,0.001059322033898305,0.007415254237288136,0.001059322033898305,76.45,0,9,0,0,8,3,4,0.73,5,24,62.8,35.75,0,76.45,13,175.55999999999997,28.25,12.75,209.55999999999997,175.55999999999997,,0.7484790663743464,0,0.25943728223829415,0,0,0.237455908152084,0.1045643555637339,0.13472338607037426,0.027630096429148758,0.1629170484829154,0.4829900449515023,0.7096809796213153,0.5818640843368482,0,0.18933139574356017,0.3360000958152614,0.16010067848544537,0.025762384183264028,0.01162727073757934,0.19110673378565696,0.8996225358662423,0.8088932662143431,57
89,"“I’m not talking politics at all,” Tom Brady said in response to the first of several questions about, predictably, politics. Brady has been getting a lot of these, beginning with Super Bowl week’s Opening Night on Monday at Minute Maid Park in Houston. This is not your average    Super Bowl week in America. The chaos in Washington, bedlam at airports and protests across the country serve as an unsettling crowd noise to even the serene superstar quarterback for the New England Patriots. Brady is friends with President Trump. So are the Patriots’ owner, Robert Kraft, and Coach Bill Belichick. No sports team has been more closely associated with a new president, or perhaps any president, at least since Richard Nixon very publicly adopted the Washington Redskins as his own and even called occasional plays for Coach George Allen. Like Trump, the Patriots are a divisive juggernaut that tend to engender strong passions for and against. The team represents a kind of sporting ideal of Trump’s promise to make “America win so much, you’ll be bored of winning. ” New England, which will appear in an N. F. L.  ninth Super Bowl on Sunday, is a team that wins so much that a lot of America has become, yes, bored of its winning. And no small number of fans are convinced that the Patriots (like Trump) achieve their victories through dubious means and wish they would just go away and get off their TVs forever. The three main architects of the team’s success  —   Kraft, Belichick and Brady  —   have taken pains to emphasize that their allegiance to Trump is based on friendship and loyalty, nothing more. They play golf and attend weddings and call to congratulate one another on elections and Super Bowl wins, those kinds of everyday things. They are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides. Kraft has been a supporter of many Democrats and Democratic causes over the years Belichick declared himself apolitical in response to queries last fall after Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire read aloud from an effusive note of congratulations that Belichick had sent him. Brady started getting questions about Trump last fall when a red “Make America Great Again” cap was spotted in his Gillette Stadium locker, reportedly put there by Kraft. Brady at first gave sheepish,   responses suggesting that it would be cool to have a golf pal as president. (“There’d be a putting green on the White House lawn,” he predicted.) But the questions took on an edgier urgency as Trump’s victories and offenses kept mounting  —   ending with Trump where he is now, and Brady dropping into a reflexive   every time Trump’s name is mentioned to him. Brady, whose makeshift podium on the Minute Maid field on Monday night was swarmed with a few hundred reporters, was the central battlefield of incoming   questions. He countered with his most anodyne deflections. “I’m just a positive person” became Brady’s   blow off, which he also deployed in the face of several questions about Deflategate, the     scandal given new life this week by the prospect of Commissioner Roger Goodell’s having to award the Super Bowl trophy to the man he suspended for four games to begin this season. Other Atlanta Falcons and Patriots players were also invited to weigh in on political matter but mostly demurred. The Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, a practicing Muslim, was asked to discuss Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven   countries. He declined politely, other than to say that it was “ a very tough situation” and “hard for me to talk about right now. ” I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots, the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long, if they had anything to say about these developments. They absolutely did, they said, and would speak out at some point later, but they did not want to create any “distractions” during Super Bowl week. The Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett did say that if the Patriots won on Sunday and were invited to the White House, he would probably not go, because “I don’t support the guy that’s in the [White] House. ” And really, was that so distracting? One enduring reason the Patriots are constantly being asked about their Trump connections is that the new president is hardly shy about reminding people of them. He has been dropping Brady’s name  —   and Kraft’s, and Belichick’s  —   at every opportunity over the last several months. This first became evident to me in the fall of 2015 as Trump was enjoying his unlikely rise to   status in the Republican primaries and I had several visits with him for a profile I was writing for the magazine. A few months earlier, I had written a story about Brady, who had just won his fourth Super Bowl and was then embroiled in the Deflategate fiasco, in which the league said it was “more probable than not” that Brady was “at least generally aware” that a minuscule amount of air pressure might have been removed from the footballs he used in the first half of the Patriots’   blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the A. F. C. championship game. When Trump learned that I had recently spent time with Brady and around the Patriots, he became even more animated on the subject  —   and insistent that I enlist the star quarterback to say nice things about him for my story. “He’s a good friend of mine,” Trump said about Brady for the first of many times. “A really good friend of mine. ” Trump declared himself “disgusted” by the N. F. L. ’s treatment of Brady over Deflategate. “It’s so ridiculous what they’re doing to him. ” He mentioned he had just spoken to Brady. “He said: ‘Mr. Trump’  —   he calls me Mr. Trump, which he shouldn’t, because we play golf all the time. Anyway, he says: ‘Mr. Trump  —   Donald,’ he doesn’t even know what the [expletive] to call me. It’s the craziest thing. He’s a friend of mine. ” Also, Kraft  —   great friend, great friend. George Steinbrenner  —   “big time winner”  —   was Trump’s best friend, he said, and now Kraft is right up there, too, as one of his favorite guys. Kraft had visited him a few days earlier, and Trump said he chastised the Patriots owner for not fighting harder against the league’s suspension of Brady, in addition to other sanctions levied by the N. F. L. against the Patriots (including the loss of a   draft pick and a record fine). “You know, Bob Kraft is also one of my best friends,” Trump told me. “I said, ‘Bob, you should have never made the deal. ’” “Bob said, ‘I had a wink from the commissioner,’” Trump added, meaning that Kraft seemed to think that by standing down and not fighting the N. F. L. the league would reduce Brady’s penalty on appeal. Kraft was under pressure, Trump explained. “He choked, just like Romney choked. He said: ‘You know what? They winked at me.’ I said, ‘Bob when you make a deal, you should have gotten it all wrapped up.’ Who ever heard of making a deal like that? Now you got this mess. ” Kraft should never have trusted Goodell, he said. “The commissioner is a weak guy,” Trump said. “When he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You’re stupid. You’re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he’s going overboard with their star, Brady. ” He added: “The commissioner is a dope. He’s a stupid guy. ” By far the best deal Kraft ever made was hiring Belichick, Trump said. Who, by the way, is also “a great, great friend” of Trump’s, even though everyone just assumes he’s “a really rough guy. ” “So I go to the Patriots game last year,” Trump said. “I’m on the sidelines with Kraft. He’s got Les Moonves right here. He’s got a lot of different people. And Belichick comes over in his Patriots sweatshirt and the hoodie and the whole thing. He hugs me, and he kisses me, and he said: ‘I love you. You’re the greatest. ’” Trump sat at his cluttered desk and seemed almost dreamy at the memory, as if the reception from Belichick genuinely moved him. “He just feels warmly toward me, Belichick does,” Trump said. “Isn’t that the craziest thing?” After the Deflategate ruling was handed down by the commissioner that spring, Trump said he tried to persuade Brady to sue the league personally. “I said, ‘Tom.’  —   I gave him a lawyer.  —   I said: ‘Here’s what you do. Sue the N. F. L. for $500 million tomorrow. Sue ’em up in Boston, for everything. They’ll come to the table.’ He said, ‘Aw, man.’ He really was torn. He’s not Trump. He said, ‘I just want to win another Super Bowl. ’” Trump told Brady that he understood. A few weeks later, the future president was showing me around Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. We were accompanied by Damon Winter, a Times photographer who had, a few months earlier, photographed Brady for the profile that was published in February. At one point, as Trump showed me around his   golf Xanadu on the Pacific, he looked over at Winter. “Who’s got a better body, me or Tom Brady?” he asked. (No answer from Winter that I recall.) In the course of my time with Trump, he kept urging me to call Brady and ask him about his great friendship with Trump. Brady would say great things, no doubt. “Ask him, ‘How is Trump as a golfer? ’” Trump urged. Brady had been particularly hunkered down during the Deflategate ordeal. N. F. L. politics can be brutal like the   kind. Plus, the   in the press over his friendship with Trump was not making Brady any more eager to engage beyond his usual helpings of football platitudes. Finally, after Trump kept insisting, I reached out to Brady, fully expecting a polite   from the quarterback, and who could blame him? “I really have no interest in political talk right now,” Brady wrote. “I have learned way too much about politics the last seven months. ”",0,1720,13.65079365079365,126,0.25232558139534883,0,0,0,0,80.41371354743448,11.079457364341089,78.89192886456908,68.56146179401993,0.7982558139534883,0.02441860465116279,0.05872093023255814,0.05058139534883721,0.05465116279069768,0.01802325581395349,0.23313953488372094,0.005813953488372093,0.0029069767441860465,0.03372093023255814,0.07965116279069767,0.002325581395348837,0.07093023255813953,0.00872093023255814,0.0017441860465116279,0.012209302325581395,0.011627906976744186,0.08662790697674419,0.004069767441860465,0.06046511627906977,0.025,0.046511627906976744,0,0,0.020348837209302327,0.011046511627906977,0.08488372093023255,0,0.0005813953488372093,0.005232558139534884,0.0011627906976744186,0.0005813953488372093,0.007558139534883721,0.06976744186046512,0.00872093023255814,0.00872093023255814,0.47848837209302325,0.004069767441860465,0.01918604651162791,0.0029069767441860465,0.02441860465116279,0.04127906976744186,0.004069767441860465,0.0017441860465116279,0.019767441860465116,0.012209302325581395,0.015116279069767442,0.045930232558139536,0.0011627906976744186,0.011046511627906977,0.012209302325581395,0.014534883720930232,0.0017441860465116279,0,0.013953488372093023,0.2424418604651163,0.010465116279069767,0.002325581395348837,0.030813953488372094,0.07034883720930232,0.03953488372093023,0.08255813953488372,0.037209302325581395,0.037209302325581395,0.13488372093023257,0.12383720930232558,0.02441860465116279,0.004069767441860465,0.047674418604651166,0.12325581395348838,0.0005813953488372093,0.025,0.0017441860465116279,0.0005813953488372093,0.006395348837209302,0,0.0005813953488372093,0.04011627906976744,0.12848837209302325,0.05872093023255814,0,0.022093023255813953,0.009302325581395349,0.05406976744186046,0.1377906976744186,0.14011627906976745,0.0011627906976744186,0.022093023255813953,0.007558139534883721,101.35,0,67,36.5,12,11.175,22,46.725,85.3125,50.425,29.25,75.45,122.75,10,101.35,0,316.175,35.175,193.775,541.1250000000001,316.175,,0.6687579441668442,0,0.5716742982900032,0.42099386075321027,0.1929272807679017,0.18207857501511704,0.3047108227038211,0.48207574993875596,0.6295563200460941,0.5011199965236597,0.3681579191572544,0.6004794208975598,0.7097443351707978,0.16611405616547328,0.1356014468307394,0,0.14836060766027334,0.016505366883688193,0.09092615402662912,0.25391518564138665,0.7751914482757052,0.7460848143586134,130
90,"Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, withdrew his support on Saturday for Donald J. Trump as the Republican Party descended into chaos. On Friday, a recording was released showing Mr. Trump speaking about women in lewd and degrading terms. Though he faced calls from many in his party to step aside, Mr. Trump vowed in an interview that he would “never drop out of this race in a million years. ” He later took a stronger stance on Twitter. Ms. Trump said in a statement on Saturday that although his words about women were “unacceptable and offensive” to her, she hoped that “people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. ” Mr. Trump showed up just before 5 p. m. in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, accompanied by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and his eldest child, Donald Trump Jr. Security officials stopped reporters and attempted to bar them from getting near Mr. Trump as he went outside and immersed himself in a crowd of supporters, who had gathered hours earlier for a rally. “Hundred percent,” Mr. Trump told reporters who yelled questions about whether he would stay in the race. He ignored other questions about his response to the defections by Republicans. Separately, one of Mr. Trump’s advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, was seen on CNN getting into a car outside Trump Tower, which he had earlier entered for planned debate preparation sessions. “There is nothing that will cause his dropping out,” Mr. Giuliani said. “That is wishful thinking of the Clinton campaign and those who have opposed him for a long time. ” Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the Republican megadonors who previously supported Senator Ted Cruz, suggested Mr. Trump’s remarks were irrelevant to the race. “If Mr. Trump had told Billy Bush, whoever that is, earlier this year that he was for open borders, open trade and executive actions in pursuit of gun control, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him,” they said in a statement. The Mercers also compared Mr. Trump’s actions to Bill Clinton’s treatment of women. The tactic is a favorite of Mr. Trump’s supporters, including Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who devoted most of his show on Friday evening to allegations of abuse by Mr. Clinton. • Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state under President George W. Bush, who has generally has not discussed politics since becoming a private citizen, called for Mr. Trump to leave the race. She said she hoped to support someone who has the dignity and stature to be president. “Enough!” Ms. Rice said in a Facebook post. “Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw. ” • Mr. McCain, who has criticized Mr. Trump repeatedly, officially withdrew his backing. “I have wanted to support the candidate our party nominated,” he said in a statement. He added: “But Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. ” • House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said he was “sickened” by Mr. Trump’s behavior and disinvited him from a Saturday event in Wisconsin. There, he referred obliquely to the episode. “There is an elephant in the room. That is not what we are here to talk about today. ” (Here’s how Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, have condemned Mr. Trump in past statements.) • Former primary opponents such as Carly Fiorina and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Mr. Trump should stand down. Mr. Kasich declared that the warning signs were right and that he would never vote for Mr. Trump. • Mr. Trump’s most strident defender, his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, called the remarks from the 2005 video indefensible. • We are also tallying the number of Republican leaders who say they won’t vote for Mr. Trump. Experts say that swapping out a presidential nominee at this stage of the game would be virtually impossible unless Mr. Trump dies, becomes incapacitated or decides to quit. Trying to change the Republican National Committee’s rules with so little time until Election Day would be a logistical nightmare, and those rules do not give the party the power to change the nominee because people are unhappy. If Mr. Trump did decide to drop out, the logistics would also be challenging because ballots have been printed and voting has already started in many places. We break it down in our Q. and A. Still, as unlikely as that scenario appears to be, that remains the best hope for finding a new nominee. The showdown between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton on Sunday night takes on even greater importance after Mr. Trump’s latest controversy. Unless he speaks beforehand, it will be his first chance to publicly take questions about his behavior on the recording. The audience could approach 100 million. Many Republicans who have yet to denounce Mr. Trump have suggested that the debate will be a    moment for him.

91,"CAIRO  —   In many ways, life is not so bad for Egypt’s deposed ruler, Hosni Mubarak. At the Cairo hospital he calls home, he enjoys regular deliveries of flowers, newspapers and takeout restaurant meals visits from his wife, two sons and grandchildren and a sweeping view over the Nile. To mark his 88th birthday recently, a throng of   gathered at the hospital gates and sang, danced and waved his portrait. Mr. Mubarak pulled open a window and waved back. However, the one luxury Mr. Mubarak has not been afforded is the right to simply walk out of the hospital  —   which is something of a conundrum. In May 2015, a judge decreed that Mr. Mubarak had completed his   prison sentence for corruption, in the only successful prosecution of the onetime strongman since his turbulent ouster in 2011. Technically, he was a free man. Yet Mr. Mubarak remains confined to the hospital room that has doubled as a jail cell for the past three years, with a guard posted outside his door. His legal limbo continues even as many of his former allies, men who grew fabulously rich during his three decades of rule, are quietly cutting deals with the government to overturn their own convictions. Mr. Mubarak’s longtime lawyer, Farid   declined interview requests. But several of Mr. Mubarak’s friends, including those who visit him in the hospital, explain the situation as a delicate deal between him and Egypt’s powerful military. They say the military has been generally lenient toward   figures since President Abdel Fattah   took power in 2013, but wants to avoid the likely outcry that would accompany Mr. Mubarak’s release. So the two sides have reached a compromise: Mr. Mubarak agrees to stay in the hospital for now, and the government agrees that his two sons, Alaa, a businessman, and Gamal, once seen as his political heir, will remain free. Both were released from jail last year. “His weak point is his two sons,” said Yousri Abdelraziq, a volunteer lawyer for Mr. Mubarak. “And whenever he speaks in public, the authorities get upset. ” Mr. Abdelraziq said he had received Mr. Mubarak’s permission before speaking to a journalist and produced a cellphone picture of himself standing beside the former president, looking grumpy inside his hospital room. Security and his medical treatment are other factors in Mr. Mubarak’s hospital stay, friends say. A military spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of an arrangement with Mr. Mubarak. Mr. Mubarak’s legal limbo is a reflection of the curious place he occupies in Egyptian public life, five years after the heady protests that ended his long rule. Many Egyptians still despise him as the totemic symbol of the rampant cronyism and repression that plagued Egypt for decades. His incarceration is one of the last remaining victories for the leaders of the 2011 protests, many of whom are now languishing in Mr. Sisi’s jails. But others have started to look back on Mr. Mubarak’s rule with a twinge of bitter nostalgia, as a time of relative freedom compared with the harsh authoritarianism of Mr. Sisi’s rule. “Of course Mubarak was corrupt, but he knew how to take good advice,” said Osama Diab, an anticorruption researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent rights group in Cairo. “Now it’s a disaster. Mubarak was a competent dictator Sisi is not. ” As hard feelings toward Mr. Mubarak seem to be receding, so do his legal woes. The humiliations of 2012 and 2013, when he was forced to sit in a courtroom cage, are largely over. He avoided prosecution on the most serious charges, like the deaths of protesters in 2011, and he now faces a retrial in one final case. There is little prospect of it coming to court anytime soon, lawyers say. Instead, Mr. Mubarak is whiling away his days at the Maadi Military Hospital, a towering complex overlooking the Nile. Staff members there say he lives under a permissive yet firm regimen. Security is tight, and all visitors are vetted by the Ministry of Defense, a security official said. He chats on his cellphone (he has an old Nokia model without Internet access) and occasionally receives a barber who dyes his hair. Nurses sometimes see him shuffling the halls as part of therapy for a fractured pelvis he suffered in a fall in the bathroom in 2013. Mr. Mubarak frequently receives flowers from admirers, and visits from his wife, Suzanne, his sons and his grandchildren, and a tight circle of ardent admirers. They say his mood veers from high spirits to embittered grumbling, describing a man who is scornful of the allies who abandoned him, dismissive of the young protesters who pushed him out, and largely unrepentant for his 29 years in power. “He feels betrayed,” said Hassan Ghandour, a former Republican Guard who befriended Mr. Mubarak. “When he sees critics on TV who used to suck up to him, it leaves him very irritated. ” Maadi Military Hospital has been the stage for other   political dramas. In 1980, the shah of Iran died there, on the floor below Mr. Mubarak, having fled to Egypt from revolutionary Iran. The next year, Egypt’s own ruler, Anwar   was rushed to the hospital after being shot by Islamist officers at a military parade. He died hours later, paving the way for Mr. Mubarak to take over. Mr. Mubarak is very conscious of his own legacy, said Mr. Abdelraziq, the lawyer, and was “very upset” to be convicted of corruption. He gently nudged his way back into the spotlight last year, giving a rare if unrevealing   phone interview to a television talk show. Shortly afterward, security at his room was tightened. Since Mr. Sisi took power in 2013, the government and courts have shown great leniency toward the powerful figures of Mr. Mubarak’s era  —   business tycoons, ministers and cronies, now exonerated or released from jail  —   underscoring the sharp limits of change in Egypt since 2011. In the latest case, on May 4, an appeals court overturned a   sentence for corruption against Ahmed Nazif, who served as prime minister under Mr. Mubarak from 2004 to 2011. Others are seeking to buy their freedom with cash payments. A lawyer for Hussein Salem, a billionaire businessman and Mubarak confidant who fled to Spain in 2011, has agreed to transfer 75 percent of his wealth  —   5. 5 billion Egyptian pounds, or about $626 million at the official exchange rate  —   in exchange for the overturning of two convictions, carrying sentences of seven and 15 years. “The deal is done from our part,” said the lawyer, Mahmoud Kebaish. “Now we are waiting for the government. ” Adel   of the Illicit Gains Authority, which handles such deals, said it had received more than 30 settlement requests from businessmen and former officials linked to Mr. Mubarak. Another Illicit Gains Authority official said Mr. Mubarak, too, was hoping to cut a deal, offering about $10 million in return for the quashing of his corruption conviction. That bid is unlikely to succeed soon, and few believe Mr. Mubarak will be heading to his villa in Sharm el Sheikh anytime soon. But short of a full release, he may have an eye on shaping his legacy and overturning his conviction so the state will restore his military honors and ensure a state funeral. “What matters now about Mubarak is how he goes down in history,” said Mr. Diab, the researcher. “When he dies, the fight will be over whether he was a thief or a military hero, whether he was responsible for the current chaos in Egypt, or whether he saved the country from it until he was kicked out. ”",0,1282,21.366666666666667,60,0.32605304212168484,0,0,0,0,94.52544387489786,6.887096243343403,88.0547521900876,29.68981655817957,0.7956318252730109,0.0124804992199688,0.038221528861154444,0.035101404056162244,0.041341653666146644,0.0124804992199688,0.17784711388455537,0.00546021840873635,0.00546021840873635,0.0109204368174727,0.0873634945397816,0,0.05226209048361934,0.01794071762870515,0.00234009360374415,0.00858034321372855,0.0015600624024961,0.05226209048361934,0.00078003120124805,0.07098283931357255,0.0187207488299532,0.0499219968798752,0,0.0046801872074883,0.01950078003120125,0.0031201248049922,0.11622464898595944,0,0.0062402496099844,0.00546021840873635,0.0015600624024961,0,0.01170046801872075,0.041341653666146644,0.00234009360374415,0.00234009360374415,0.44383775351014043,0.014040561622464899,0.01794071762870515,0.0070202808112324495,0,0.02574102964118565,0.00078003120124805,0.0015600624024961,0.01014040561622465,0.01794071762870515,0.0062402496099844,0.0842433697347894,0.01014040561622465,0.0202808112324493,0.0031201248049922,0.0187207488299532,0,0,0.0327613104524181,0.20436817472698907,0.0062402496099844,0.00078003120124805,0.031981279251170044,0.07098283931357255,0.054602184087363496,0.05850234009360374,0.02106084243369735,0.08268330733229329,0.15210608424336974,0.0842433697347894,0.01326053042121685,0,0.0171606864274571,0.1482059282371295,0.0039001560062402497,0.01014040561622465,0.01014040561622465,0.00234009360374415,0.0078003120124804995,0,0,0.05382215288611544,0.13962558502340094,0.07410296411856475,0.00078003120124805,0.015600624024960999,0.0031201248049922,0.06006240249609984,0.10998439937597504,0.10452418096723869,0.0015600624024961,0.027301092043681748,0,55.225,0,112.49000000000001,3,12,10,23.25,52.5,6.68,80.875,45,22.375,39,0,55.225,0,159.28,40.25,246.86499999999998,418.465,159.28,,0.6145259617047513,0,0.7645566716147959,0.0797002925727394,0.2572842744474721,0.22400923773979586,0.401616719582262,0.6024717442908779,0.16166107763488058,0.700119366080091,0.5650354826521338,0.39243359165246416,0.5295961685242233,0,0.6755426735951072,0,0.09970797482260958,0.025196170182132317,0.15453546713073527,0.2619556610003975,-0.7814514646250097,0.7380443389996025,103
92,"Posted on November 5, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse On November 3rd, Morning Consult’s Jon Reid bannered, “Poverty on the Rise in Nearly All House Districts” and he reported that, “A Brookings Institution study , released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.” That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic ‘recovery’ after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study “Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913” , published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. America’s soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. In fact: whereas Bush’s stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obama’s coming into oiffice restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The “Share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders” soared throughout Obama’s Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what ‘recovery’ from the ‘recession’ there is, went only to the very rich. Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nation’s poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama.",1,448,26.352941176470587,17,0.3236607142857143,0,0,0,0,99,41.069597069597066,49.107142857142854,81.93243243243244,0.8214285714285714,0.022321428571428572,0.07589285714285714,0.03571428571428571,0.046875,0.011160714285714286,0.21651785714285715,0,0,0.020089285714285716,0.09598214285714286,0,0.026785714285714284,0.002232142857142857,0,0.008928571428571428,0.020089285714285716,0.08258928571428571,0.004464285714285714,0.06473214285714286,0.05357142857142857,0.04241071428571429,0.017857142857142856,0,0.03125,0,0.12276785714285714,0,0.006696428571428571,0.002232142857142857,0,0,0.011160714285714286,0.020089285714285716,0,0,0.44642857142857145,0.002232142857142857,0,0.013392857142857142,0,0.03571428571428571,0.006696428571428571,0,0.013392857142857142,0.006696428571428571,0.006696428571428571,0.004464285714285714,0.060267857142857144,0.024553571428571428,0.011160714285714286,0.006696428571428571,0.006696428571428571,0,0.08258928571428571,0.25223214285714285,0.026785714285714284,0.004464285714285714,0.011160714285714286,0.05133928571428571,0.11383928571428571,0.015625,0.03794642857142857,0.08928571428571429,0.19642857142857142,0.05133928571428571,0.04017857142857143,0,0.024553571428571428,0.15625,0,0.008928571428571428,0,0.004464285714285714,0.004464285714285714,0.002232142857142857,0,0.004464285714285714,0.033482142857142856,0.08705357142857142,0,0.011160714285714286,0.004464285714285714,0.05133928571428571,0.05580357142857143,0.05357142857142857,0,0.060267857142857144,0.006696428571428571,12.25,0,0,0,2,0,15,2,5,8,7,30,4,0,12.25,0,54.25,15,52,104.25,54.25,,0.39916466839710824,0,0,0,0.09785171972967724,0,0.4485768149459706,0.09785171972967724,0.21331887166009167,0.3025822873792978,0.2751670872924413,0.619334522432905,0.17826035697019474,0,0.6483712952255928,0,0.10328415040456926,0.028557829604950024,0.09900047596382675,0.19847691575440266,0.14717035739848075,0.8015230842455974,27

94,"The nicest thing I own is the first thing you see when you walk into my house: a red handmade rug bought in Tehran, haggled over in Farsi and delivered, in person, to the Brooklyn apartment of the man who would become my husband. Back then, James told me the woman who gave him the rug, a woman he had recently dated, was by then “just a friend. ” I didn’t believe men and women could be “just friends. ” At least not if they were single, with one or both actively seeking a romantic partner. Yet I also agreed to be “just friends” with James, at first. I was the one who contacted him. We had both joined a dating service called, pretentiously enough, The Right Stuff, after seeing an ad for it in The New Yorker. “I liked your profile,” he wrote in his first email, “but didn’t contact you because you have a child. ” At least he didn’t write, as several others had, “Thank you for being so honest. ” It’s a line that makes you ask yourself: How could a mother lie about being a mother? Not ethically, but logistically? Maybe a liar would wait until the man is smitten, then spring the child on him and shout, “Surprise!” But to what end? I had tried to meet other single parents. I met a man who   about the $   child support his   demanded for his daughters’ clothing allowance. I met another who asked how much I weighed, as if I were a chicken he was considering for a recipe. Then there was the man who told me about his summer plans to share a house with other singles on Fire Island. “Do you do that every year?” I asked. He let out of a puff of air. “Of course not. Next year I’ll be married. ” “Married to who?” I asked. “I don’t know yet. ” Meeting my eyes over his mojito, he said, “Maybe to you. ” I also met plenty of nice men with whom I had nothing in common except similar philosophies on effective potty training. So when I saw the Right Stuff ad, I thought: At least someone I meet through an ad in The New Yorker will be someone who reads The New Yorker, and we’d have that to talk about. Maybe I could find a man who reads the arts listings, and maybe even (if I could be this lucky) the poetry and fiction. I did. He was JamesNYC125. I was RedWeather. He responded to my first email: “A redheaded editor in Brooklyn  —   what could be better? But dating a woman with a child would be complicated, as I’m sure you know. ” I did. “Let’s not date,” he suggested. “Let’s just get together as friends. ” That summer we both had travel plans, so a whole month passed before our first date  —   or our first “playdate,” I guess. In the meantime, we emailed every day. I sent him poems. He sent me music. Even while discussing academic publishing, from my side as an editor and his as a researcher, we couldn’t help flirting. An economist, he would answer a question with: “Probability of 1. ” “I love it when you talk math talk,” I’d say. And he would reply, “I can do it any time you want. ” Our first meeting was on Smith Street. We talked books, then strolled to BookCourt, slid a novel off the shelf and read passages aloud. His timing was perfect, his voice what I’d hoped it would be from the emails. “I’d love to walk with you on the promenade,” he said, and then sneezed. “But I should nurse my cold. ” I wanted to nurse his cold, too. I wanted to boil him a pot of   tea and kiss him. Later I did, leaning against a car parked at a meter outside an elementary school. We both pretended I hadn’t. The next morning, he called to ask me to a modern dance performance in two weeks. We both lived in Brooklyn but met, for the second time, in Manhattan. His hand grazed my thigh in the dark, a moment I would replay over and over in my head. For our third   I suggested attending a concert on a barge docked near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Our knees touched in our cozy seats two rows from the string quartet. Next we hiked Bear Mountain. “I didn’t think a skinny girl like you could outpace me,” he said. Then later: “I’m only letting you walk ahead so I can get a good view from back here. ” So I vamped my hips. When we removed our hiking boots and socks in the car, we stared at each other’s naked feet.   No. 5 was dinner at my place. Back then, the nicest thing I owned was also the first thing you saw when you entered: a red futon couch. I chose the cover from the remnants section of a fabric store on the Lower East Side. It was something I could unzip and clean whenever a child spit up, spilled Cheerios or wiped peanut butter on it. When I pulled a book off the shelf to show James, the Pokémon cards I used for bookmarks fell out. Later, we found ourselves in bed. Finally. And that’s when he confessed, “I’m dating someone else. ” She was a fellow economist he had met at a conference around the same time he met me, an   who lived in Washington, D. C. “Now you tell me?” “You knew we could only be friends. ” “You have sex with all your friends?” I removed his hand from my belly. “I bet she doesn’t even know about me. ” I told him we had to either date or not see each other again. We were both traveling for Thanksgiving, so we decided not to email or phone until we returned home. Then he would call and tell me which woman he chose. Somehow I had turned myself into a   contestant, a   version of one of those “Bachelor” shows my friends watch. I flew to Austin, Tex. to share the holiday with my brother. “I’ve met the one,” I said. “Just because it sounds corny doesn’t mean it isn’t true. ” “Does he feel the same way?” my brother asked. I asked myself that question from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed, and sometimes in the middle of the night, too. James and I had emailed every day for months, long letters detailing our whole lives. I kept checking my inbox in Austin, though I knew it would come up empty. On the flight home, I tried to imagine my competitor. She grew up in the center of an ancient civilization. I grew up in Detroit. Her furniture probably smelled like an exotic perfume, not peanut butter. She was not a single mother. He had already informed me about how complicated dating a single mother could be. Did I even have a chance? Trying to think like a statistician, I put my odds at  . Or, as an economist would say: probability 0. 5. Minutes after I arrived home, James called. “I choose you,” he said. I dropped the phone and fell onto the bare floor. Weeks later, he buzzed me up to his apartment. The door opened to reveal the most beautiful rug I had ever seen, so finely woven it was more like a tapestry. The kind of precious object that could be ruined by a few stray Cheerios crumbs. “It’s a gift from a friend,” he said. “She bought it when she visited her family in Iran. ” “She’s trying to get you back,” I said. “What? She’s just being kind. Don’t you love it?” “Sure. ” I loved imagining what I would do to it after it collected enough dust. I’d take it outside, hang it   and beat it with a stick. But James turned out to be right. Sometimes a rug is just a rug. And sometimes men and women can be friends, even after they have been romantically involved. Rug Woman never tried to win him back. Time passed, and I asked James if he ever wished he had chosen her. “No,” he said. “You’re perfect for me. ” Right. I wasn’t the kind of person who would fantasize about walloping a beautiful rug. At least I wasn’t anymore. Months later, James met my son, Jonah. I cooked Jonah’s favorite, “chicken with crumbs,” and after our dessert of apple crisp, we played Clue. The next day, Jonah asked, “Can I have another playdate with my new friend?” “Which one?” “James. ” Now we share the rug. It holds a place of honor in the house James and I bought together. We wipe our feet on the porch before crossing the threshold, food is banned from the entryway, and I vacuum it with care. I treat the rug as we all deserve to be treated.

95,"In preparation for the scheduled 2018 launch of their Starliner spacecraft, Boeing has unveiled an innovative redesign of the traditional astronaut’s space suit.[  In the service of crawling out from beneath Russia’s current monopoly on spaceflight, NASA contractors Boeing and SpaceX continue to push toward the completion of   American craft. And while both are working hard on their respective rocket designs, Boeing was eager to demonstrate another vital element of the mission: The next generation of space suit. The “Boeing Blue” suit is leaner, lighter, more mobile, and sports quality of life improvements across the board. Crew and Mission Systems Director Chris Ferguson explained, “Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn’t need that. ” The new suit has been “simplified,” replacing the sealed   with a heavy   zipper, and adding breathable mesh beneath the surface to maximize comfort, mobility, and airflow. They are offering “pressurized mobility, while still preserving unpressurized comfort. ” Its gloves have been enhanced with special material on the palms and two of the fingers to allow for “capacitative” touch screen interaction. That means that astronauts can now interact with their capsule’s advanced touch interfaces, without leaving the protection of the suit. It’s also much lighter. While current space suits come in at a hefty 33 lbs, the Boeing design is barely 12. Ferguson claims that you can lie in the cockpit without any real need for external cooling, and it is comfortable enough to stand around in without developing an uncomfortable “heat load. ” The boots are “breathable and slip resistant,” and zippers on the torso have been designed to make it easier for a suited individual to “comfortably transition between sitting and standing. ” And, of course, the head provides     communications built right in, and significant improvements to peripheral vision. Despite the current  —   and somewhat convoluted  —   challenge of getting our intrepid men and women into space right now, we’re finally getting on track for a return to the forefront of   tech. And we’re doing it in style.

96,"  Donald J. Trump overhauled his transition team from top to bottom on Friday, expanded his outreach to more establishment Republicans, and even offered an olive branch to President Obama  —   albeit a narrow one. On the other side, Democrats signaled they would move left in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s    defeat, and the  ’s legal antagonist, Gloria Allred, made it clear that neither she nor many of the women who have accused him of sexual assault are going anywhere. Join us again on Monday for continuing live updates on the transition to the 45th presidency of the United States. Mr. Trump said Friday that, after talking with President Obama this week, he might be willing to leave in place parts of the Affordable Care Act once he’s in office. Mr. Trump made the comments to The Wall Street Journal in his first interview since winning the election. The newspaper said Mr. Obama had urged the   to reconsider repealing his signature health care law, which Mr. Trump said had become “unworkable. ” But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patient’s   condition and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26. The problem: Without a mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, the popular   condition provision could send insurance companies into a tailspin, because their costs would rise with sicker customers, and that would not be offset by healthy consumers forced to buy insurance. Mr. Trump said in an interview to be shown on “60 Minutes” Sunday that Mrs. Clinton “couldn’t have been nicer” in a congratulatory call she made to concede the election, and that Bill Clinton had complimented him on “one of the most amazing” presidential runs he had ever seen. “It was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her  —   I mean, I can imagine, tougher for her than it would have been for me,” Mr. Trump said. “She couldn’t have been nicer. She just said, ‘Congratulations, Donald, well done. ’” Mr. Trump, who on Thursday said he would seek Mr. Obama’s counsel about the presidency, said he would consider asking for Mr. Clinton’s as well. Mr. Trump also promised that there would be no lapse in health insurance for millions of Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act when he repeals and replaces the law. “We’re going to do it simultaneously  —   it’ll be just fine,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff. We’re going to repeal it and replace it. And we’re not going to have, like, a   period and we’re not going to have a   period where there’s nothing. ” Mr. Trump has quietly reached out to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who took an impassioned stand against Mr. Trump during the campaign. The call came after Mr. Trump’s surprise victory on Tuesday night, according to two people briefed on it, although it was unclear how it went and what was said. Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney did not respond to requests for comment. With her eye on the right’s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the   into a legal battle before he takes office. Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat. “  Trump now has the opportunity to act presidential,” Ms. Allred said at a news conference with Summer Zervos, the former contestant on “The Apprentice” who said last month that Mr. Trump tried to seduce her and grabbed her breasts in 2007. Ms. Allred cited a precedent for suing a sitting president: Ms. Jones. “Obviously the lawsuit against President Clinton by Paula Jones did proceed while he was in office for actions that were alleged to take place prior to his becoming president,” she said. The Jones case forced Mr. Clinton into a deposition that resulted in his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern. A sobbing Ms. Zervos sat next to Ms. Allred and offered her own solution: “What happened to a good,   I’m sorry?” Vice   Mike Pence will take the lead on the  ’s transition. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is under a cloud after two aides were convicted of conspiring to shut down traffic on the George Washington Bridge in the   Bridgegate scandal, moves aside. Mr. Trump told advisers that he wanted Mr. Pence’s Washington experience and contacts. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Mr. Pence as the process moves forward. See the full story. Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as Mr. Trump’s campaign manager and then went to work for CNN, even as he continued to consult with the campaign, resigned Friday from his political commentator role, the network confirmed. Mr. Lewandowski is expected to take a position in the Trump administration. He was seen in Trump Tower on Wednesday immediately after Mr. Trump’s victory, chatting with senior aides and attending meetings. Mr. Lewandowski did not return calls for comment. Mr. Lewandowski was viewed as a controversial appointment by the network he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Trump that prevented him from criticizing the candidate publicly, and he was still being paid by the campaign while working for CNN. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, threw his weight behind Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota on Friday to be the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the clearest sign yet that, in defeat, the party will move to the left. After losing the   Rust Belt to Mr. Trump, Democrats could have recruited an   populist like Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who represents the Youngstown area. But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont quickly backed Mr. Ellison, who is black, Muslim and an ardent progressive. Two former governors, Howard Dean of Vermont and Martin O’Malley of Maryland, also expressed interest Friday in being the party’s new committee chairman. So much for a warm welcome to Washington. Groups on social media are trying to coordinate a Million Woman March the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration in protest of the new president. The march will go from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21 to show “strength, power and courage. ” Men are also encouraged to attend. “No woman is free unless all women are free,” the organizers of the march wrote on the Facebook page where it is being organized. State groups for the march have already been formed for people to coordinate travel to the capital. However, some fear that the idea could become a logistical nightmare coming so close to Inauguration Day because of the lack of hotel rooms and the potential for clashes with Trump supporters Among the  ’s most pressing questions as he prepares to take office is where he should live. Mr. Trump, a provincial homebody who divides his time among golf courses in Florida and New Jersey and his townhouse apartment in Manhattan, is weighing how much time to spend in Washington, according to two people familiar with his deliberations. One option is spending weekends in New York and most of the week in Washington. Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, is ultimately planning to move to Washington, according to one person briefed on the discussions, but their    son, Barron, is still in school. Mr. Trump may be triumphant, but Gloria Allred isn’t done with him yet. More than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault after a video bragging about his groping habits emerged last month. Ms. Allred, the lawyer who has been working with many of the women, does not appear to be letting the   off the hook. At 2:30 p. m. Eastern time on Friday, she said that she was going to issue a challenge to Mr. Trump at a news conference with one of his accusers who has already come out publicly to tell her story. Ms. Allred would not reveal the name of the woman before the event or share any details of the challenge. Before the election, Mr. Trump said that the accusers were all lying and that he might sue them. Ms. Allred told ABC News on Thursday that her clients had no plans to sue Mr. Trump at this point, but that they would countersue if he did so. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the departing Democratic leader, added his voice to the postelection statements on the  . Unlike most Democrats, he gave no quarter: Some of the   protesters who have taken to the streets this week are supporters of Mr. Sanders, and on Friday the former Democratic presidential candidate reminded them that creating chaos and disorder should not be their goal. Trump Tower, the skyscraper on Fifth Avenue and the home base of the   has become a fortress in the wake of the election. The lobby, designated a public space by the City of New York, was closed off on Friday morning as Mr. Trump met with advisers. A large police presence surrounded the building. The tower was built with a special permit more than 30 years ago. The city granted Mr. Trump extra space in exchange for maintaining public access to the lobby. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley libertarian who secretly financed a lawsuit against the website Gawker, was named a member of the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee on Friday afternoon.",0,1659,22.41891891891892,74,0.297166968053044,0,0,0,0,93.69459150428318,8.543704164155113,87.27021441487987,50.52200120554551,0.8059071729957806,0.018685955394816153,0.0433996383363472,0.022905364677516575,0.040988547317661245,0.014466546112115732,0.16998191681735986,0.006630500301386378,0.0018083182640144665,0.017480409885473176,0.08921036769138035,0,0.07172995780590717,0.010247136829415311,0.0024110910186859553,0.011452682338758288,0.004822182037371911,0.0699216395418927,0.003616636528028933,0.05183845690174804,0.023508137432188065,0.040988547317661245,0,0.0006027727546714888,0.020494273658830622,0.014466546112115732,0.11392405063291139,0,0.0018083182640144665,0.0024110910186859553,0.02230259192284509,0,0.015069318866787222,0.05244122965641953,0.0006027727546714888,0.0006027727546714888,0.45569620253164556,0.003616636528028933,0.011452682338758288,0.0024110910186859553,0.004822182037371911,0.037371910789632305,0.0018083182640144665,0.0018083182640144665,0.010247136829415311,0.01567209162145871,0.007233273056057866,0.05364677516576251,0.014466546112115732,0.020494273658830622,0.011452682338758288,0.013261000602772756,0.0006027727546714888,0.0012055455093429777,0.01567209162145871,0.21880650994575046,0.0018083182640144665,0,0.02109704641350211,0.07715491259795057,0.07172995780590717,0.05123568414707655,0.02652200120554551,0.07775768535262206,0.1512959614225437,0.08860759493670886,0.012055455093429777,0.0006027727546714888,0.017480409885473176,0.14345991561181434,0.0012055455093429777,0.011452682338758288,0.003616636528028933,0.0024110910186859553,0.006630500301386378,0,0.0030138637733574444,0.03676913803496082,0.14707655213984328,0.06811332127787824,0,0.013863773357444244,0.006027727546714889,0.05726341169379144,0.12718505123568416,0.13743218806509946,0.0030138637733574444,0.048824593128390596,0.0006027727546714888,45.4,0,130.675,1,16.75,7,13,40.875,24,38.425,18.5,40.875,51.5,0,45.4,10,170.025,30,219.3,408.32500000000005,170.025,,0.5413089806597872,0,0.77255849466308,0.025335204951550165,0.30332790667791365,0.15394505720712706,0.2525705458455034,0.5151503472303649,0.3841796846905139,0.4997024015465371,0.3247279369649218,0.5151503472303649,0.5724081396014942,0,0.4032835462772512,0.2063099139372659,0.08682164604955765,0.015319214124315422,0.11198345524874574,0.2085072702437032,-0.6443034337017971,0.7914927297562968,109
97,"The Washington Post tried to compare Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s speech being stopped after she attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and broke the rules in the Senate this week to Breitbart Senior Editor MILO’s    at UC Berkeley last week in an opinion piece citing the Streisand Effect. [“What’s the best way to make sure a message gets heard? Try to muzzle it,” declared The Washington Post‘s Catherine Rampell on Thursday. “Both liberals and conservatives are newly rediscovering the political power of this phenomenon, known as the Streisand Effect. The term refers to what happens when an attempt to censor information backfires and instead unintentionally draws more attention to the censorship target. ”  “After all, suppression of speech not only generates more public interest, as bystanders scramble to learn what all the fuss is about it can also win the speaker sympathy and the moral high ground,” explained Rampell, before comparing Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s attempt to suggest Jeff Sessions was a racist before his confirmation as attorney general to MILO’s Berkeley event, which was violently shut down by   rioters. “The riots didn’t silence Yiannopoulos, however instead, the resulting coverage megaphoned his ugly message to a much broader audience and will help him sell more books, schedule more lucrative speaking gigs and receive more sympathetic tweets from our sitting president. ” Throughout the piece, Rampell failed to go into detail on why Warren, who was stopped from speaking after she broke Senate rules and falsely branded Sessions as a racist, was remotely similar to MILO, who was forced to evacuate UC Berkeley after violent rioters started several fires, smashed up buildings and ATMs, assaulted numerous attendees, and attacked cars passing by. “There are many compelling arguments for why protecting free speech, including speech you disagree with or even abhor, is important,” concluded Rampell. “But one underappreciated argument is  . Forcibly silencing and thereby martyring your opponents  —   rather than employing   to expose them as wrong or, better yet, ridiculous  —   may be exactly what they want you to do. ” Whereas Warren clearly broke the rules of the Senate by slandering Sessions, and was thus punished and not unfairly silenced, MILO was violently stopped from delivering a speech at a college he was invited to. MILO was also threatened with more violence by   activists should he return to Berkeley to deliver his speech, while Warren, as far as Breitbart News is aware, has not been violently threatened by fellow senators should she return to the Senate.",0,414,29.571428571428573,14,0.41545893719806765,0,0,0,0,89.506957776523,13.901281243436255,68.53899240855763,1,0.7801932367149759,0.014492753623188406,0.0893719806763285,0.03864734299516908,0.06763285024154589,0.016908212560386472,0.15458937198067632,0.033816425120772944,0.004830917874396135,0.014492753623188406,0.06521739130434782,0,0.06521739130434782,0,0,0.024154589371980676,0.012077294685990338,0.10144927536231885,0,0.06521739130434782,0.06280193236714976,0.06763285024154589,0,0,0.03140096618357488,0.00966183574879227,0.10386473429951691,0,0,0,0.007246376811594203,0,0.004830917874396135,0.05314009661835749,0.007246376811594203,0.007246376811594203,0.42028985507246375,0,0.03140096618357488,0,0,0.026570048309178744,0,0,0.024154589371980676,0.024154589371980676,0.0024154589371980675,0.016908212560386472,0.007246376811594203,0.012077294685990338,0.00966183574879227,0.050724637681159424,0,0,0.0024154589371980675,0.25120772946859904,0.007246376811594203,0,0.03140096618357488,0.033816425120772944,0.04106280193236715,0.036231884057971016,0.016908212560386472,0.06763285024154589,0.14492753623188406,0.06280193236714976,0.033816425120772944,0.0024154589371980675,0.03140096618357488,0.12077294685990338,0.0024154589371980675,0.00966183574879227,0.021739130434782608,0.00966183574879227,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0.07971014492753623,0.04589371980676329,0,0.012077294685990338,0.004830917874396135,0.06038647342995169,0.10386473429951691,0.12077294685990338,0.0024154589371980675,0.03140096618357488,0.007246376811594203,5,0,121.875,1,3,14.75,8,30,12,48.375,11.875,4,10.875,0,5,0,43.75,22.75,165.375,225.625,43.75,,0.23006275550355904,0,0.8792769802463632,0.05639139975154663,0.15202805015514587,0.4685038290699065,0.3234518715067226,0.6419419098057333,0.4176353409424863,0.7429939639816004,0.415090770468572,0.19292728076790167,0.3939047018987858,0,0.5679881780637586,0,0.07432575918454024,0.038649394775960924,0.2809513697175621,0.3833085580802718,-0.9113411404479196,0.6166914419197282,51
98,"CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.  —   Jasmine Mateen was standing outside her home here on Tuesday afternoon when her cellphone went off: Two of her daughters, who were injured when their school bus crashed on Monday, were being discharged from the hospital. The news pulled her briefly from her grief. Moments before, Ms. Mateen had been talking about her    daughter Zyaira, the girl with the new   coat, who died in the same bus crash that injured two of Ms. Mateen’s other daughters. “My baby’s coming home, but her sister’s dead,” Ms. Mateen said as a single tear rolled down her left cheek. “Even though she was the one who told me my baby was dead, I just didn’t want to believe it,” she said of her other    Zasmyn. The third daughter on board, Zacauree’A Brown, is 10. “I couldn’t believe it. You know how you try to hold on to hope?” This city, just north of Tennessee’s border with Georgia, reeled on Tuesday as it coped with the grim toll of the deadly school bus crash. The authorities said that at least five Woodmore Elementary School students  —   four girls and a boy  —   had died, and that 12 others were still hospitalized. Six of the children were in intensive care. Elsewhere in Chattanooga, the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, 24, was jailed and charged with vehicular homicide after the authorities said he had recklessly sped and swerved during his afternoon route. “We are heartbroken for all of our students and their families,” said Kirk Kelly, the interim schools superintendent in Hamilton County. “Yesterday was the worst day that we have had for Woodmore and for Hamilton County Schools that I can recall in my life as an educator and as a parent and as a member of this community. ” Three of the students who died were in the fourth grade. The other children who were killed were in kindergarten and first grade, Dr. Kelly said, but he did not identify the students. “They will always be with us throughout our lives,” he said. “This is something that we will never forget here as a community. ” The bus was removed from the scene on Tuesday, and crews worked along the blocked street to restore the utility pole that the police said Mr. Walker had struck. A small memorial of stuffed animals and flowers took shape, and investigators reviewed the crash site. The National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation, and it will be months before federal officials reach any conclusions. But the Chattanooga authorities moved quickly to assign blame, and in an arrest affidavit issued on Tuesday, a police officer wrote that Mr. Walker had been driving “at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 m. p. h. ” Eventually, the police said, Mr. Walker “lost control of the bus” and swerved off the narrow roadway. The bus, which ultimately landed on its side, struck a mailbox, an elevated driveway, a tree and a telephone pole. The officer, explaining the decision to charge Mr. Walker with vehicular homicide and other crimes, cited “the reckless nature” of his driving, as well as “his very high speed and weaving within his lane. ” Tests for drugs and alcohol are pending, Chief Fred Fletcher of the Chattanooga Police Department said in an interview on Tuesday. Federal investigators say they expect to interview Mr. Walker, who received his commercial driver’s license in April and was involved in a minor bus crash in September. Mr. Walker’s employer, Durham School Services, which holds a contract to bus thousands of Hamilton County students each day, said in a statement that it was “devastated by the accident. ” The statement did not address questions about the company’s hiring practices, nor did it respond to reports that parents, including Ms. Mateen, had complained about Mr. Walker. A criminal history report from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation indicated that Mr. Walker had no arrests before the crash on Monday, but State Department of Safety and Homeland Security records showed that his license was suspended briefly in 2014 for an insurance violation. No one answered the door at Mr. Walker’s apartment on Tuesday morning, when a woman who said she was a   tried to slip a note under his door. The safety record of Durham, which is based near Chicago and says it transports more than a million schoolchildren in communities around the country each day, was also under scrutiny on Tuesday. A federal regulator, in statistics published late last month, said the company had received 10 “driver fitness violations” over the course of two years  —   a figure better than only a fraction of other similarly sized transportation companies. The federal Department of Transportation said Durham’s drivers had been involved in 346 accidents in two years, but the statistics did not distinguish whether the company’s employees were to blame for the wrecks. And although federal officials had flagged Durham for its record on driver fitness, the company had not drawn special attention for a history of unsafe driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said the company had a “satisfactory” safety rating. A company spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions, but the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Christopher A. Hart, said the panel would look into the company during its investigation. Student fatalities aboard school buses are rare in the United States, where an estimated 25 million children use them daily. In a May report that examined crash data between 2005 and 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 53   children had died in accidents while they were riding in what the government classified as “school transportation vehicles. ” Emotions were raw on Tuesday outside Woodmore, where Demetrius Jenkins stood around daybreak and thought about how he had not yet told his son about the crash. “I don’t know how to explain it,” Mr. Jenkins said while students ran, walked and skipped toward the school for their final day of classes before Thanksgiving break. The school district said that about 100 of Woodmore’s approximately 315 students were in their classrooms on Tuesday. The crash occurred about 16 months after a gunman opened fire at two military sites in Chattanooga, killing five servicemen. “Five is a cursed number in our city right now, and so we are again dealing with unimaginable loss,” Mayor Andy Berke said. “The most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child. There are no words that can bring comfort to a mother or a father. ”",0,1102,21.192307692307693,52,0.3448275862068966,0,0,0,0,91.80814104226083,35.02027738567362,82.73688864069989,22.9471484353517,0.8248638838475499,0.011796733212341199,0.038112522686025406,0.03539019963702359,0.03176043557168784,0.019963702359346643,0.1705989110707804,0.0054446460980036296,0,0.013611615245009074,0.09800362976406533,0.0009074410163339383,0.06261343012704174,0.010889292196007259,0.0027223230490018148,0.0054446460980036296,0.0027223230490018148,0.060798548094373864,0.0009074410163339383,0.05989110707803993,0.021778584392014518,0.05172413793103448,0,0.010889292196007259,0.024500907441016333,0.004537205081669692,0.0925589836660617,0,0.012704174228675136,0.0009074410163339383,0.022686025408348458,0,0.007259528130671506,0.08257713248638839,0,0,0.46098003629764067,0.009981851179673321,0.022686025408348458,0.008166969147005444,0.007259528130671506,0.04446460980036298,0.0027223230490018148,0.0009074410163339383,0.017241379310344827,0.018148820326678767,0.008166969147005444,0.022686025408348458,0.0054446460980036296,0.024500907441016333,0.012704174228675136,0.016333938294010888,0.0009074410163339383,0.0018148820326678765,0.030852994555353903,0.21415607985480944,0.003629764065335753,0,0.02631578947368421,0.05898366606170599,0.08983666061705989,0.045372050816696916,0.014519056261343012,0.05353901996370236,0.1397459165154265,0.08983666061705989,0.008166969147005444,0.0009074410163339383,0.032667876588021776,0.16424682395644283,0,0.0018148820326678765,0.010889292196007259,0.007259528130671506,0.0027223230490018148,0,0,0.021778584392014518,0.1297640653357532,0.08439201451905626,0,0.009981851179673321,0.007259528130671506,0.05898366606170599,0.11978221415607986,0.12341197822141561,0.007259528130671506,0.06261343012704174,0.0018148820326678765,11,0,112,2,19,0,5,22.375,2.83,121,13,1,16,12,11,0,47.83,10,262.375,315.205,47.83,,0.25434095856924505,0,0.77643502510103,0.05839581272817413,0.37073871704078026,0,0.13423167976942957,0.4096182503042989,0.08067497647095948,0.7895645356829278,0.28729897004767463,0.030076064478531474,0.3316128774121265,0.2711923793731366,0.8220733605223791,0,0.035956863791671206,0.007517638258764627,0.1972440338143369,0.2369597167353904,-0.9039239443891754,0.7630402832646096,87

100,"Eleven years ago, Lonnie G. Bunch III was a museum director with no museum. No land. No building. Not even a collection. He had been appointed to lead the nascent National Museum of African American History and Culture. The concept had survived a bruising, racially charged congressional battle that stretched back decades and finally ended in 2003 when President George W. Bush authorized a national museum dedicated to the   experience. Now all Mr. Bunch and a team of colleagues had to do was find an unprecedented number of private donors willing to finance a public museum. They had to secure hundreds of millions of additional dollars from a Congress, Republican controlled, that had long fought the project. And they had to counter efforts to locate the museum not at the center of Washington’s cultural landscape on the National Mall, but several blocks offstage. “I knew it was going to be hard, but not how hard it was going to be,” Mr. Bunch, 63, said in an interview last month. In less than three weeks, though, with President Obama presiding, the new museum, a project that once thirsted for money, land and political support, is scheduled to open on the Mall. Visitors to the $540 million building, designed to resemble a   crown, will encounter the sweeping history of black America from the Middle Passage of slavery to the achievements and complexities of modern black life. But also compelling is the story of how the museum itself came to be through a combination of negotiation, diplomacy, persistence and cunning political instincts. The strategy included an approach that framed the museum as an institution for all Americans, one that depicted the black experience, as Mr. Bunch often puts it, as “the quintessential American story” of measured progress and remarkable achievement after an ugly period of painful oppression. The tactics included the appointment of Republicans like Laura Bush and Colin L. Powell to the museum’s board to broaden bipartisan support beyond Democratic constituencies, and there were critical efforts to shape the thinking of essential political leaders. Long before its building was complete, for example, the museum staged exhibitions   some on the fraught topics it would confront, such as Thomas Jefferson’s deep involvement with slavery. A Virginia delegation of congressional members was brought through for an early tour of the Jefferson exhibition, which featured a statue of him in front of a semicircular wall marked with 612 names of people he had owned. “I remember being very impacted,” said Eric Cantor, then the House Republican leader, who was part of the delegation. Mr. Bunch said that he hoped the Jefferson exhibition   criticism by establishing the museum’s bold but balanced approach to difficult material. “Some people were like, ‘How dare you equate Jefferson with slavery,’” he recalled. “But it means that people are going to say, ‘Of course, that is what they have to do. ’” And the museum began an exceptional effort to raise money from black donors, not only celebrities, like Michael Jordan ($5 million) and Oprah Winfrey ($21 million) but also churches, sororities and fraternities, which, Mr. Bunch said, had never been asked for big donations before. Nearly   of the gifts from individuals were from  . An unusually high amount  —   $4 million  —   came from average people in gifts of less than $1, 000. “We were able to raise a level of awareness that really galvanized people to make small contributions,” said Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, who led the capital campaign. “Based on their income level, some of them on a percentage basis were significant. ” The Alfred Street Baptist Church, in Alexandria, Va. donated $1 million to the museum, while three couples who belong to the church gave individual contributions totaling an additional $4 million. “There is no doubt that we knew you couldn’t build this with   money alone,” Mr. Bunch said, “but we also know that there was much more money in this community than most cultural institutions had ever tapped. ” The idea of a national   museum had been hatched more than a century ago by black Civil War veterans. It picked up a bit of steam in Congress in the 1980s, led by Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who joined the efforts of Mickey Leland, the Texas Democrat. For 15 years, though, a bill to create the museum was defeated. “Once Congress gives the go ahead for ” Senator Jesse Helms, an opponent, warned in a 1994 speech on the Senate floor, “how can Congress then say no to Hispanics, and the next group, and the next group after that?” But in 2003, after winning support from Republicans like Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, the museum escaped from the congressional back burner. “The   community has had a particularly difficult road in the United States,” Mr. Brownback, who is now governor of Kansas, said in an interview. “It was time. ” Even with congressional and presidential support, the battle to find a spot on the Mall dragged on. Congress had rejected a site near the Capitol. Critics said the Mall was already too crowded. The World War II Memorial had only opened there in 2004. “It was bad timing,” said Judge Robert L. Wilkins, who led the   committee on a commission that made recommendations to Congress. He and other museum supporters ultimately argued successfully to the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents that a prime location would, among other things, guarantee the most visitors and the most   success. In 2006, the Regents chose a   site on the Mall near the Washington Monument. Private   had to be much more of a concern for this federal museum, the 19th in the Smithsonian portfolio. Its predecessors had received public funds for all or most of their building costs. But the legislation that created the   museum authorized the government to pay for only half. Mr. Bunch had to raise the other $270 million from private donors. Foundations helped with major gifts, and the museum identified companies likely to give. Some had expressed an interest in diversity or were led by people familiar to the museum’s board. Mr. Bunch made hundreds of trips to meet donors. His pitch: “You don’t get a chance to build a national museum every day. ” The private money was crucial in securing funds from Congress, officials said. It showed politicians how seriously their constituents were taking the museum. A membership program that has become one of the most popular in the Smithsonian demonstrated public support from individual congressional districts. Also crucial, multiple people said, was the canny persistence of Mr. Bunch, who had intimate experience with Chicago politics and who had honed his skills as a facilitator while president of the historical society there. Those skills helped him when he turned to the byzantine entanglements of the Smithsonian, of Washington and of the federal government. “You cannot be a director at a place like the Smithsonian without being political,” Mr. Bunch said. He made allies on the Hill before asking them for money. His first supporters were friends from Chicago, like Senator Dick Durbin, and then others, like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. “He has a really good demeanor for a particularly touchy subject in the United States,” said Governor Brownback. “He needed to have an optimistic outlook. This is not about retribution. ” To maintain   momentum, the museum tried to exist in some fashion long before the construction materials had even been delivered. “We had to be real from the very beginning,” Mr. Bunch said, so that people would understand that the museum was not a dream but inevitable. So the museum put out books, asked IBM to create a website, and staged exhibitions at the National Museum of American History. One of the first, in 2009, focused on the Scurlock family of black Washington photographers. Beyond land and money, the new museum needed things to show and a building to show them in. No Smithsonian museum had ever started life without a collection. The museum’s team collected artifacts from around the nation in an “Antiques Roadshow”  program in 15 cities called “Save Our African American Treasures. ” The program yielded many of the 40, 000 objects the museum now holds  —   3, 500 will be exhibited when the building opens  —   and elevated the museum’s profile. For the design of their new home, museum officials created a selection committee and displayed the final six plans at the Smithsonian Castle in an effort to be transparent about the process. The winning design, by a team led by the   British architect David Adjaye, spoke of “uplift, resiliency and spirituality,” Mr. Bunch said, and the bronze color gave the building the symbolism he sought. “I love the notion of a darker building,” he said, adding: “There’s always been a dark presence in America.

One envisioned a building shaped like a   fist, hardly appropriate for the museum he foresaw or that Congress had agreed to finance.

102,"Waking Times You can only get so far with orders, and the misuse of power. The same goes with the restriction of human action. The war on drugs has been an abject failure , as has been the American ‘democracy.’ It is the same with a corporatized prison system, and so too, will be the attempted overtaking of the American people by a corrupt cabal. If the 2016 elections have taught us nothing else, it is that we should be very careful who we make into our political martyrs. Despots and tyrants can rule effectively for a time, but in the end, they always perish – their civilizations and accomplishments with them. The fall of Rome ring any bells? It doesn’t matter if you voted for Hillary Clinton with her ties to the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, or for Trump who has alienated women, minorities, gays, and educated leftists alike with his misogynistic comments, and brash unpredictable actions. This election is a call to find our inner hero . We need her/him, as never before. This election has caused monumental stress because it has exposed our deep, perhaps subconscious desire to shirk responsibility and off-load it onto a public figure. We want an external hero. What happens when someone truly leads , is a different, and positively inspiring story altogether. 1.) What a Leader Isn’t “When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness.” ~ Joseph Campbell A true hero, or heroin — the quintessential leader of our time is not a politician. The etymology of the word leader comes from the root word ‘lead’, which means, to guide and inspire. The word hero is derived from both Greek and Latin words meaning to watch over and to protect. It doesn’t mean to lord over. It has nothing to do with warnings and chastisements, nor the use of force, either legislatively, financially, socially, or politically to get people to do what you want them to do. A true leader doesn’t divide and conquer. They gather masses without trying in a unified cause by being in service, by acting, as Anthony Robbins once said, ‘as a slave’ to a purpose higher than protecting themselves. This could be family. It could be community. A leader might inspire a few, or several thousand but their work endures, even after they perish because its intent was pure. Many leaders are quiet. Others are bold, but they are never self-serving. A tell-tale sign of a true leader, is one who needs no ‘credit’ for what they have given to society, and who simply thrives on the action of their own internally driven inspiration. They don’t check the poles and they don’t need your ‘vote.’ As Lao Tzu has said, “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” Hitler wasn’t a true leader, nor was Stalin. Their rise to fame and power was brief. Add to that list, George Soros, Bill Gates, The Clinton’s, the Trumps, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, et al. Instead, look to individuals like Edward Leedskalnin , the Latvian emigrant who built one of the most impressive structures on the planet, not for fame, but to honor a lost love. People still can’t surmise how coral castle was created. Look to Nikola Tesla whose work is used in every conceivable manner still today (some of his inventions known and others still hidden by those who seek false power.) As another true leader, R. Buckminster Fuller would say , “ You never change things by fighting existing reality . To change something you create a new model which makes the old one obsolete.” The self-appointed ‘leaders’ of our time fight against the masses. They fight against Mother Nature , and they torment themselves trying to accumulate more power to wield over the world. What could they be reflecting in us is the question we should really be asking. 2.) A True Leader Often Won’t Fit in with ‘Regular’ Society “Men do not accept their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death.” ~ Fyodor Dostoevsky Between the years 325 and 787 A.D., many people were treated poorly by society at large because of the different conflicts that were going on. One of the main conflicts in this era surrounded religion. If you were not like the Roman Catholics, and decided to believe in freedom of religion, you were “excluded” from the Roman Catholic Church and thereby, society. Those seeking religious freedom were deemed sinners, and lawless hooligans. This is just one of many incidents in history that we can look back on and observe that the societal conscience always changes. It isn’t absolute. A leader is never swayed by the ‘popular’ or the ‘common.’ They think only about what is best for society in that time and space. There have been numerous outcasts of various degree who were true leaders. Malcolm X, Bob Marley, Indira Gandhi, Hatshepsut, Aung San Suu Kyi, etc. 3.) A True Leader Can’t Solve All of Your Problems Number three is a big one. A true leader will never solve all your problems, and they don’t even try. Their sole purpose is to help you find the strength to display heroic acts of your own. They inspire. They exemplify, but they realize that by solving your problems they would actually be taking away your opportunity to learn, and grow. You’ve earned whatever lessons you currently face, but you will also receive the gifts hidden in a challenge, only when you take full responsibility and face your shadowed projections. The wicked will shout for you to change your ways. The divine will whisper, and wait for you to heed the encouragement of grace. 4.) A True Leader Will Never Ask You to Follow Them Saints and yogis are notorious for sending aspiring followers away. They’ll ignore them, cajole, them, and even ridicule their seemingly fervent desire to learn from a master. That’s because they want you to do your work first. If you are expecting some miraculous cure or salvation from anyone, even a saint, you’ll be waiting a good long while. This doesn’t mean that divine intervention doesn’t happen, or that we shouldn’t look to others for help or advice, but ultimately, a leader shows the way simply by doing his own work. The one thing we can learn from this example is to do ours, too. A final note — A true leader is ‘God’ in action. As Joseph Campbell has said, “What is a god? A god is a personification of a motivating power of a value system that functions in human life and in the universe.” No credentials or filibusters needed.

103,"They are a group that calls themselves “Public Purity”. Somehow, they have found the audacity to demand the Brits stop taking their dogs out in public because, wait for it… Dogs are considered impure under Sharia Law . Of course, these Muslims feel entitled to make this demand because it appears that they believe the British citizens are required to do certain things in order to keep Muslims from feeling uncomfortable. Somehow, it’s become the responsibility of the Brits to ensure that Muslim residents feel more at home. This intrusive behavior being served up by Muslim immigrants does in part explain British citizens refusal to remain in the European Union. Does that make any sort of sense to you? It’s like you allow guests into your home, and one day you wake up and they start telling you what you can and can’t do in your own home because…you are offensive and you must change your way of life, because YOU are the one who is wrong. @JPexsquaddie Btw this was what is on the other side of the leaflet pic.twitter.com/y3Wzm6Mg0G — Gemma Winter 🐸 (@GEMWINTER) July 12, 2016 It’s inconceivable really.

104,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The lives of the world’s top golfers revolve around a village much smaller than the facilities in and around Olympic Park, where they received a warm reception in the sport’s return to the Olympic program after a   absence. In a typical week on the PGA Tour, the players are handed the keys to luxury vehicles. In Rio de Janeiro, they rode in shuttle buses or were driven around in armored cars by members of a security detail. On Sunday, a week after Bubba Watson finished in a tie for 25th at the PGA Tour stop in Connecticut and collected a $47, 226. 66 check, he earned nothing for finishing tied for eighth at the Rio Games, which he described as “one of the greatest golf trips I’ve ever been on. ” The biosphere that the golfers normally inhabit was broadened immeasurably during the weeklong competition that culminated with the coronation of Britain’s Justin Rose, who closed with a   67 to win the first gold medal awarded in golf since 1904. Rose, the 2013 United States Open champion, finished at 16 under par, two strokes ahead of the reigning British Open champion, Henrik Stenson of Sweden. Rose and Stenson arrived at the 18th hole tied at 15 under. Rose hit his third shot about three feet from the hole and then watched as Stenson   for bogey. Rose made his birdie putt to claim the gold. Matt Kuchar of the United States carded the day’s lowest round, a 63, to claim the bronze at 13 under. As he came off the 18th green, Kuchar pulled his wife, Sybi, into a lingering embrace. When they separated, he told her, “I’ve never been so happy with a   finish in my life. ” Despite not winning a medal, Watson, a   Masters champion, said: “This is the greatest sporting event I’ve ever been a part of. I get to go to the Masters for the rest of my life, but it’s just golf. ” The sport’s return to the Olympics got off to an inauspicious start, with many of the best players, including the top four in the rankings, opting out because of health concerns, security fears and scheduling issues. Those who came appeared prepared to leave with lasting memories and no apparent regrets. “Once we got down here, we realized what a great experience it was,” said Rose, who was inspired to win a medal for his wife, Kate, a former member of the British acrobatic gymnastics team. She was a European champion who rose to fourth in the world before retiring at age 17 without having had a chance to compete in the Olympics because her sport was not included in the Summer Games. “I was very excited about golf in the Olympics,” Kate Rose said. “At least one of us will get to the Olympics. So from the beginning, he really embraced it. ” While golf’s   Big Four  —   Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy  —   stayed home, Rose and his wife ventured out to watch gymnastics. Watson turned up at diving, swimming, women’s field hockey and men’s basketball sessions. Stenson checked in at handball matches. When golfers talk about their team, they typically mean their caddies. At the Olympics, Rose’s support group included all the athletes competing for Britain and every fan on the course waving the Union Jack. A sellout crowd of 12, 000 flocked to the course Sunday. The spectators’   support for their countrymen dispelled the notion that golf is an individual sport. “With the flags and everything, it’s as emotional as I’ve ever felt about a win,” said Rose’s caddie, Mark Fulcher. “Honestly, bless athletics,” he added, referring to track and field. “It looked great, but it was a   stadium. There was nothing   about this place today. It was an amazing atmosphere. ” At the start of the week, Rose and Fulcher added an app to their phones to receive alerts whenever a British athlete wins a gold medal. “It’s going to be pretty amazing seeing the gold flip up with Rosie,” Fulcher said. During his down time, Kuchar attended a bronze medal tennis match featuring the American doubles team of Jack Sock and Steve Johnson. He watched the Americans finish off their Canadian opponents and run toward the players’ box, shouting giddily about getting to wear their “podium jackets. ” The scene stuck with Kuchar, who said he got to thinking about how nice it would be to wear the United States jacket that was reserved for the medals ceremony. On Sunday, his eyes welled up as he talked about his podium jacket moment. “It was just an overwhelming feeling of pride,” he said. Kuchar’s caddie, John Wood, stood by his man all day only to be separated from him for the medals ceremony. Wood did not care that the caddies do not get medals. He choked up and took several seconds to compose himself. “Being a part of this,” Wood said, “I don’t need anything else. ”",0,846,18.391304347826086,46,0.29432624113475175,0,0,0,0,97.11963619539563,21.146340332823435,69.86052009456264,82.78832515002728,0.7777777777777778,0.037825059101654845,0.04018912529550828,0.03546099290780142,0.04373522458628842,0.01773049645390071,0.1879432624113475,0,0.002364066193853428,0.024822695035460994,0.10756501182033097,0,0.0425531914893617,0.01182033096926714,0.004728132387706856,0.00591016548463357,0.013002364066193853,0.05555555555555555,0.001182033096926714,0.07092198581560284,0.022458628841607566,0.041371158392434985,0,0,0.016548463356973995,0.004728132387706856,0.09219858156028368,0,0.0035460992907801418,0.00591016548463357,0.008274231678486997,0,0.00591016548463357,0.06501182033096926,0,0,0.4574468085106383,0.0070921985815602835,0.01182033096926714,0.001182033096926714,0.010638297872340425,0.03309692671394799,0.001182033096926714,0,0.009456264775413711,0.014184397163120567,0.03309692671394799,0.028368794326241134,0.001182033096926714,0.02127659574468085,0.01182033096926714,0.00591016548463357,0.001182033096926714,0,0.03309692671394799,0.21631205673758866,0.004728132387706856,0,0.028368794326241134,0.05319148936170213,0.05673758865248227,0.05555555555555555,0.037825059101654845,0.03900709219858156,0.1690307328605201,0.08865248226950355,0.015366430260047281,0,0.03309692671394799,0.1595744680851064,0.002364066193853428,0.024822695035460994,0.0035460992907801418,0.0035460992907801418,0.010638297872340425,0,0,0.02955082742316785,0.08747044917257683,0.08392434988179669,0,0.0070921985815602835,0.01182033096926714,0.057919621749408984,0.11465721040189125,0.11702127659574468,0.0035460992907801418,0.02364066193853428,0,78.75,0,8,6,5,4,0,8,53.625,17,16,45.725,34,0,78.75,1,192.1,15,44,248.1,192.1,,0.7219372553337694,0,0.20870562407669346,0.16514593965750815,0.141516769699476,0.11651106980622213,0,0.20870562407669346,0.6387236112212296,0.35916882756815444,0.3453373921977398,0.601197779705203,0.5285124559702928,0,0.141516769699476,0.031916759277699894,0.1861253754481155,0.014533475438426511,0.04263152795271776,0.24038368375157448,0.8735009563688183,0.7596163162484255,62
105,"On a frigid February day in Reykjavik, I stood   chested and dripping wet just inside the dressing room at the Vesturbaejar pool, facing a long, cold walk to the outdoor hot tubs. My host was stoic, strong, a Viking. I was whining. “I just don’t want to go out there,” I said. “How do you make yourself do it?” “You must, to swim in the pool,” Valdimar Hafstein said with a shrug. He is a folklorist at the University of Iceland who studies the country’s pools. “Kids hate it, too. I have to haul my kids kicking and screaming. ” I took a deep breath and tried to think of warm things. Wearing only a Speedo bathing suit  —   I had packed three, in honor of the island’s reputation as one of the company’s most avid markets  —   I stepped onto the deck. It was a few degrees below freezing. Imagine the feeling you get when you hold an ice cube tight, that combination of sting and ache, except imagine it all over your nearly nude body. Battling my   ingrained instincts never to run at a swimming pool, I fell into a kind of brisk   aiming for the large set of interconnected hot tubs in the center of the complex. I’m sure I looked ridiculous. The good news: I’d never been less concerned about my appearance while wearing almost nothing in public. Small snowflakes glittered in the sky, which at 4 p. m. was already darkening toward dusk. I reached the largest hot tub and sank to my chin. For one glorious moment, I felt my mind go blank: There was just my body, my big, stupid body in its stupid bathing suit, enveloped in warmth, the cold wind on my ears only heightening my delight. Behind me, Valdimar ambled across the deck, saying hello to a neighbor in another hot pot. Every Icelandic town, no matter how small, has its own pool. There are ramshackle cement rectangles squatting under rain clouds in the   boonies. There are fancy aquatic complexes with multilevel hot tubs and awesomely dangerous water slides of the sort that litigious American culture would never allow. All told, there are more than 120 public pools  —   usually geothermally heated, mostly outdoors, open all year long  —   in Iceland, a country with a population just slightly larger than that of Lexington, Ky. “If you don’t have a swimming pool, it seems you may as well not even be a town,” the mayor of Reykjavik, Dagur Eggertsson, told me. I interviewed him, of course, as we relaxed together in a downtown hot tub. These public pools, or sundlaugs, serve as the communal heart of Iceland, sacred places whose affordability and ubiquity are viewed as a kind of civil right. Families and teenagers and older people lounge and chat in sundlaugs every day, summer or winter. Despite Iceland’s cruel climate, its remoteness and its winters of 19 hours of darkness per day, the people there are among the most contented in the world. The more local swimming pools I visited, the more convinced I became that Icelanders’ remarkable satisfaction is tied inextricably to the experience of escaping the fierce, freezing air and sinking into warm water among their countrymen. The pools are more than a humble municipal investment, more than just a civic perquisite that emerged from an accident of Iceland’s volcanic geology. They seem to be, in fact, a key to Icelandic   being. This past winter, I visited Iceland and swam in 14 pools all over the country. I found them full of Icelanders eager to discuss what role these underwater village greens played in their lives. I met recent immigrants to the Westfjords town Bolungarvik as they mingled with their new neighbors, their toddler carrying fresh handfuls of snow into the hot tub and delightedly watching them melt. I saw Icelandic parents splash with their kids to calm them before bedtime I talked to adults who remembered that ritual from childhood and could summon the memory of slipping their   bodies between cool sheets. I heard stories of divorcing couples splitting their local pools along with their possessions and retired couples bonding by swimming together every day. I watched four steaming septuagenarians swim laps in a northern Iceland pool while the sunrise lit up the mountains behind them and an attendant brought out foam cups of coffee balanced on a kickboard. “I think the swimming pools are what make it possible to live here,” the young artist Ragnheidur Harpa Leifsdottir said. “You have storms, you have darkness, but the swimming pool is a place for you to find yourself again. ” For centuries, Iceland was a nation of seamen who regularly drowned within sight of shore. One local newspaper reported in 1887 that more than 100 Icelanders had drowned that winter alone. In 1931, a boat carrying four farmers capsized while they tried to row a panicking cow across Kollafjordur fjord. Three of the men died one, who had studied swimming, survived. Incidents like this fostered an enthusiasm for swimming education. At the time, the only place to learn was a muddy ditch downstream from the hot spring where the women of Reykjavik did laundry. Inspired by that hot spring, and using a heavily mortgaged drill that had been brought to Iceland to search fruitlessly for gold, the city soon tapped the underground hot water generated by Iceland’s volcanic underbelly. Iceland’s first geothermal heat flowed into 70 homes and three civic buildings: a school, a hospital and a swimming pool. The national energy authority offered   loans to villages across the country to encourage geothermal drilling, and within a generation, the ancient turf house had nearly disappeared from Iceland, replaced by modern apartment buildings and homes, all of them so toasty warm that even on winter nights most Icelanders leave a window open. With hot water flowing through the country and a populace eager to take a dip  —   swimming education was made mandatory in all Icelandic schools in 1943  —   pools soon popped up in every town. “Because of the weather, we don’t have proper plazas in the Italian or French style,” the writer Magnus Sveinn Helgason explained to me. “Beer was banned in Iceland until 1989, so we don’t have the pub tradition of England or Ireland. ” The pool is Iceland’s social space: where families meet neighbors, where newcomers first receive welcome, where rivals can’t avoid one another. It can be hard for reserved Icelanders, who “don’t typically talk to their neighbors in the store or in the street,” to forge connections, Mayor Dagur told me. (Icelanders generally use patronymic and matronymic last names and refer to everyone, even the mayor, by first name.) “In the hot tub, you must interact,” Mayor Dagur continued. “There’s nothing else to do. ” Not only must you interact you must do so in a state of quite literal exposure. Most Icelanders have a story about taking visitors, often American, to the pools and then seeing them balk in horror at the strict requirement to strip naked, shower and scrub their bodies with soap from head to toe. Men’s and women’s locker rooms feature posters highlighting all the regions you must lather assiduously: head, armpits, undercarriage, feet. Icelanders are very serious about these rules, which are necessary because the pools are only lightly chlorinated tourists and shy teenagers are often scolded by pool wardens for insufficient showering. The practice was even the subject of a popular sketch on the comedy show “Fostbraedur,” in which a zealous warden scrubs down a reluctant pool visitor himself. That one of the   naked bystanders in that viral video, Jon Gnarr, was later elected mayor of Reykjavik demonstrates that Icelanders are quite     conscious about nudity in the service of pool cleanliness. This was made most clear to me, perhaps, in a dressing room in the town Isafjordur, where a chatty   store manager named Snorri Grimsson told me a long story about the time a beautiful Australian girl asked him to go to the pool but then revealed that she doesn’t shower before swimming. He mugged a look of comic horror, then brought home the kicker: “It was a very difficult decision. Thankfully, the pool was closed!” I could tell this bit killed with his fellow Icelanders, but my own appreciation of it was somewhat impeded by Snorri’s delivery of it in the nude, his left foot on the sink, stretching like a ballet dancer at the barre. “It’s wonderful,” an actress named Salome Gunnarsdottir told me in the pool one evening. “Growing up here, we see all kinds of real women’s bodies.       olds,   aged, pregnant women. Not just people in magazines or on TV. ” Her friends, all in their 20s and pregaming for a Saturday night out in the bars, nodded enthusiastically. “Especially pregnant women,” Helga Gunnhildursdottir agreed. “You can see: Oh yes, she really got quite big. ” “It’s so important,” Salome said earnestly. “You get used to breasts and vaginas!” As a journalist, I will never forget the uniquely Icelandic experience of shaking hands with handsome Mayor Dagur and then, just minutes later, interviewing him as we each bared all. (In the tradition of politician interviews everywhere, an aide lurked nearby, in a manner I would call unobtrusive but for the fact that he was also naked.) I admit I found this disconcerting at first, but eventually there was something comforting about seeing all those other chests and butts and guts  —   which for the most part belonged to normal   being bodies, not sculpted masterpieces. And that comfort extends out into the pool proper, where you might be covered  —   only a little, in my case  —   but are still on display. But   nudity, by encouraging a slight remove from others, also allows the visitor to focus, in a profound and unfamiliar way, on his own body, on its responses and needs. Despite its being a social hub, the pool also cultivates inwardness. Results of a questionnaire distributed by Valdimar’s research team suggested that women in particular go to the pool to seek solitude. According to women I talked to, most everyone respects the posture of aquatic reverie  —   head tilted back against the pool wall, eyes closed, mouth smiling a tiny smile of satisfaction  —   that you adopt when you come to the pool wanting to be left alone. Sigurlaug Dagsdottir, a graduate student researching the pools, speculated that the sundlaugs’ social utility in Icelandic communities derives in part from the intimacy of the physical experience: In the pool, she said, you can “take off the five layers of clothing that usually separate you from everyone else. ” As such, the pools are a great leveler: Council members in Reykjavik make a point to circulate among the city’s sundlaugs, where they often take   natured grief from their constituents. The filmmaker Jon Karl Helgason, who is shooting a documentary about Iceland’s pools, said, “When people are in the swimming pool, it doesn’t matter if you are a doctor or a taxi driver. ” His girlfriend, Fridgerdur Gudmundsdottir, added, “Everyone is dressed the same. ” On the way from Reykjavik to Keflavik airport is the Blue Lagoon, a luxurious   water spa that is one of Iceland’s most popular tourist destinations. There, for 40 euros, you can shower in private stalls and float in   rich water  —   discharge from the nearby Svartsengi power plant, which uses turbines twice as tall as a man to generate 75 megawatts of electricity and 150 thermal megawatts of heat for the surrounding towns. My final day in Iceland, I turned off the highway just after the Blue Lagoon and instead drove into one of those towns, the port Rekjanesbaer. The lobby of the town’s pool is dotted, fittingly, by a series of   like windows. The woman working at the desk charged me nine bucks and asked, “Is this your first time in an Iceland swimming pool?” “Nope,” I said with some pleasure. The familiar signs in the showers were supplemented by notices in Polish, targeting the new wave of immigrants who have found work in Rekjanesbaer. I snapped on my Speedo, steeled my courage and exited the warm lodge into the chill. The         Celsius hot pot was full of enormous men with   type physiques and also a small girl in a pink ruffled bathing suit. The largest of the Blutos rose from the water, picked up the girl and carried her, giggling, to the family pool. His biceps sported a tattoo of a roaring bear consumed by flames. This time I didn’t approach anyone, didn’t ask any questions. I didn’t speak at all. I concentrated on what I could feel: the water pressing lightly on my skin, the wind prickling my beard. All around me was the soft white noise of a community. The conversation the connection the freedom, within that flurry of sociability, to withdraw and simply be within yourself. It called to mind something a Ph. D. student named Katrin Gudmundsdottir told me on my first day in Iceland. She was describing a certain ineffable emotional state to me, a native Icelander’s sense of comfort while immersed in her neighborhood sundlaug. When I thought of what she said, a perfect G chord strummed inside me. “It’s not exactly like you’re happy,” she had mused. “It’s that you know how to be in the swimming pool. ” The sun was low on the horizon, bright but evanescent. The only other thing in the   blue sky was the contrail of a jet, pointed to the west. I closed my eyes. I was in the pool.",0,2281,19.495726495726494,117,0.30600613765892154,0,0,0,0,92.05278492524634,49.412538360368266,66.31671572618525,49.427444103463394,0.8114861902674265,0.00657606313020605,0.055677334502411226,0.04164839982463832,0.03594914511179308,0.01841297676457694,0.1709776413853573,0.0035072336694432268,0.003068829460762823,0.01709776413853573,0.09557211749232793,0.0008768084173608067,0.05129329241560719,0.027181060938185005,0.01797457255589654,0.00920648838228847,0.01841297676457694,0.08066637439719421,0.004384042086804033,0.06839105655414292,0.020604997807978958,0.04340201665935993,0,0.0021920210434020165,0.01972818939061815,0.00657606313020605,0.05392371766768961,0.0008768084173608067,0.003068829460762823,0.015344147303814117,0.008768084173608066,0,0.004822446295484437,0.04471722928540114,0.0035072336694432268,0.0035072336694432268,0.46514686540990796,0.0035072336694432268,0.0070144673388864535,0.012713722051731697,0.03156510302498904,0.039017974572555895,0.00263042525208242,0.005699254712845244,0.01446733888645331,0.013590530469092503,0.03770276194651469,0.007452871547566856,0.00394563787812363,0.023235423060061378,0.01052170100832968,0.011398509425690487,0,0.0008768084173608067,0.016220955721174924,0.20429636124506795,0.00526085050416484,0.0008768084173608067,0.03857957036387549,0.049539675580885574,0.06795265234546252,0.06532222709338009,0.024112231477422183,0.020166593599298552,0.1433581762384919,0.104340201665936,0.019289785181937746,0.0008768084173608067,0.02367382726874178,0.15914072775098642,0.0008768084173608067,0.007452871547566856,0.00263042525208242,0.0021920210434020165,0.014028934677772907,0,0.004822446295484437,0.00920648838228847,0.08987286277948268,0.09732573432704954,0.0008768084173608067,0.020604997807978958,0.009644892590968873,0.0394563787812363,0.09907935116177115,0.10477860587461639,0.0021920210434020165,0.014905743095133712,0.012713722051731697,90.1875,6,62.2,3,76.34687500000001,6.625,4,46.2,2.73,86.3,75.88,73.125,50.349999999999994,4,90.1875,1,363.4275,24.625,203,577.4275,363.4275,,0.6508863947317597,0.11034777731716484,0.5625215250353087,0.05839581272817413,0.6121441387708043,0.12045772884615628,0.07637443457795405,0.48850869735531216,0.05342094996372432,0.6408088466471166,0.6106867944106071,0.6018590519199685,0.5100100410716762,0.07637443457795405,0.5714359299043875,0.02025376079084707,0.13438241550198704,0.009105439136379142,0.07506209724608998,0.2135119170323479,0.8242574257840285,0.7864880829676522,154
106,"US to Hold Off on Cyberwar With Russia Until After Election Obama wants to do it together with Clinton   Antiwar.com While the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a “time of their choosing,” the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. From President Obama’s standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn’t want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she’d inherit. Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party “certainty” that Russia is behind hacks against them. Rep. Adam Schiff (D – CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release “forged” documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. Earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will “have the greatest impact.” Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks.

107,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had good news on Monday for subway riders worried about the shutdown of the L train: The closing will be shorter than expected. The authority’s board voted to approve a $477 million contract to close the L train tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan for 15 months to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy  —   instead of 18 months as originally planned. The work is set to begin in April 2019. After several board members raised concerns about a company that was awarded the contract, Judlau Contracting, officials assured the board that the company was the best choice for the project and would finish the work on time. “I expect this project to be completed in 15 months,” said Lawrence S. Schwartz, an authority board member. “I want to make sure that Judlau and everybody else who is going to be involved on this project understands that it will not be tolerated or accepted to be 15 months and one day. ” Brooklyn residents who rely on the L line have grown increasingly anxious over how they will commute during the closing. Officials at the authority have discussed several alternatives using nearby subway lines and buses, but they have not outlined a specific plan yet. About 250, 000 people take the line under the East River each day. The L train tunnel, officially known as the Canarsie Tube, was one of several subway tunnels inundated by floodwaters during the hurricane in 2012. Workers must demolish and replace thousands of feet of crumbling walls, tracks and cables. The agency awarded the contract to two companies, Judlau Contracting and TC Electric. Judlau Contracting had been criticized for delays on the Second Avenue subway and in rebuilding the Cortlandt Street subway station, which was damaged on Sept. 11. One authority board member, Charles G. Moerdler, said the company had done a “dreadful job” on the Second Avenue subway. “I am reluctant in the extreme to vote to give Judlau yet another chance,” Mr. Moerdler said at a board committee meeting last month. Stephen Plochochi, an official at the authority who oversees subway and bus procurements, said officials had looked at the company’s “full body of work,” including the rehabilitation of the Montague Tube, which was also damaged during the hurricane. If it takes longer than 15 months to fix the Canarsie Tube, the company will be fined $410, 000 per day, Mr. Plochochi said. Cesar Pereira, a vice president at Judlau Contracting, said in a statement that the company had a “long and successful history” of working with the authority. “With the help of its employees and subcontractors and the M. T. A. ’s very capable staff and designers, Judlau and TC will once again deliver a successful project to the M. T. A. and the riding public,” Mr. Pereira said. Transit advocates have urged the authority to provide robust bus service during the closing, including dedicated bus lanes on the Williamsburg Bridge, 14th Street in Manhattan and Grand Street in Brooklyn. A proposal for a “PeopleWay” on 14th Street would prioritize buses, bike lanes and wider sidewalks over cars. If people use Uber and other car services or private shuttles during the L train shutdown, street congestion will become even worse, said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists that is campaigning for the PeopleWay. The authority should announce its plans for alternative service by this summer so that commuters can plan their lives, he said. “It’s going to completely gum up the streets unless some aggressive bus prioritization measures are instituted,” Mr. White said. “It will lead to catastrophic traffic congestion. ”",0,613,17.514285714285716,35,0.3735725938009788,0,0,0,0,96.55148342685047,23.371100894755056,64.63718204338106,28.48553561718325,0.7699836867862969,0.040783034257748776,0.037520391517128875,0.022838499184339316,0.03425774877650897,0.008156606851549755,0.1631321370309951,0.0032626427406199023,0.0065252854812398045,0.0065252854812398045,0.10603588907014681,0,0.06688417618270799,0.009787928221859706,0.0032626427406199023,0.009787928221859706,0.011419249592169658,0.0701468189233279,0.0016313213703099511,0.05546492659053834,0.01631321370309951,0.05057096247960848,0,0,0.026101141924959218,0.01468189233278956,0.0929853181076672,0,0,0.0016313213703099511,0,0,0.022838499184339316,0.04567699836867863,0,0,0.4176182707993475,0.0065252854812398045,0.01631321370309951,0.0016313213703099511,0.004893964110929853,0.03915171288743882,0,0,0.009787928221859706,0.009787928221859706,0.0016313213703099511,0.008156606851549755,0,0.026101141924959218,0.0032626427406199023,0.01631321370309951,0,0,0.03915171288743882,0.21044045676998369,0.004893964110929853,0,0.022838499184339316,0.06199021207177814,0.06525285481239804,0.011419249592169658,0.01794453507340946,0.05546492659053834,0.13376835236541598,0.05057096247960848,0.011419249592169658,0,0.03262642740619902,0.14192495921696574,0,0.013050570962479609,0.004893964110929853,0,0.004893964110929853,0,0,0.0016313213703099511,0.07177814029363784,0.06851549755301795,0,0.009787928221859706,0.004893964110929853,0.04730831973898858,0.12071778140293637,0.11256117455138662,0,0.06199021207177814,0,29.25,0,27.75,0,9,4,4,8,8,67,8,3,1,0,29.25,1,58.25,8,75.75,131,58.25,,0.5250638265237911,0,0.5119216582276698,0,0.2538249079092297,0.13133048602716904,0.13133048602716904,0.2321699762345397,0.2321699762345397,0.7169033047206979,0.2321699762345397,0.10184159092899815,0.03641990430707569,0,0.522922835399069,0.03641990430707569,0.08297720797720798,0.011396011396011397,0.10790598290598291,0.1866096866096866,-0.48331477354788277,0.8133903133903134,42
108,"It has been a very, very long election season. But we will soon know the result. Hillary Clinton enters Election Day with a clear if not insurmountable advantage over Donald J. Trump. If the polls and conventional wisdom are correct, we might know the result fairly quickly. If not, it could be a long night. The final national polls give Mrs. Clinton a   lead, and her path to the presidency is straightforward: win the states carried by John Kerry in 2004, in addition to New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. She has led in nearly every live interview survey of those states so far this year, though the large number of white   voters in many of these states gives Mr. Trump a shot at an upset. Mrs. Clinton is also competitive in North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. If she won all four, she would have a sizable victory in the Electoral College. The Upshot’s model gives Mr. Trump a 16 percent chance of winning the presidency. It would certainly be a big upset, but it would not even be the most stunning electoral surprise of the last few cycles when you consider   races, from the standpoint of the data. Anything from a narrow victory for Mr. Trump to a decisive victory for Mrs. Clinton seems fairly easy to imagine. We’ll be tracking the results live after the polls close, using early returns to try to infer how the rest of the country might vote. There are two basic paths for how the evening might proceed. Here’s what we’ll know, and when. Mrs. Clinton will probably win the presidency if she can win Florida or North Carolina, states worth 29 and 15 votes in the Electoral College. (The magic number is 270.) A win in Florida would probably allow Mrs. Clinton to survive losses in both Michigan and Pennsylvania, where she’s favored but vulnerable enough to merit late campaign stops. A North Carolina win would let Mrs. Clinton survive the loss of one but probably not both. The polls show a tight race in Florida and North Carolina, as they have for most of the year. The two states are deeply polarized along racial lines, and the result will hinge as much on turnout as on anything else. The early vote has given Democrats a lot of hope in Florida, where Hispanic turnout has shattered previous baselines. North Carolina’s early voting has been more mixed for Democrats. We will know very quickly whether Mrs. Clinton is poised to deliver a knockout blow in either state. The polls close in most of Florida at 7 p. m. and early vote results  —   which could represent 65 percent of the final vote  —   will come in fast. In 2012, half of the vote was counted by 8 p. m. The early vote will be fairly representative of the eventual outcome: If Mrs. Clinton holds a comfortable lead, it will be hard for Mr. Trump to mount a comeback. North Carolina polls close at 7:30 p. m. and the vote is counted quickly there as well. It’s a little less clear whether the early North Carolina results will be representative of the outcome. In the 2014 midterm, the early vote dropped first, and the Democratic senator Kay Hagan had a big early lead that slowly eroded as the Election Day vote came in. The 2012 election was different in North Carolina: Democrats had a big advantage in the early vote, and yet President Obama didn’t take an early lead, suggesting that the early votes were not counted first, or that Election Day votes from the rural part of the state were counted fast enough to cancel it out. Either way, we’ll have a good sense by 9 p. m of whether Mrs. Clinton is poised for a clear win. If Mr. Trump can avoid a knockout blow in the Southeast, his chances will then come down to whether he can break through Mrs. Clinton’s   firewall: states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and New Hampshire. If these states are close and end up deciding the election, it might take a while. Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota  —   three states that lean blue, but perhaps not so overwhelmingly as to allow an early call  —   can take a very long time to count their votes. In 2004, it was well after midnight Eastern before the networks projected that Mr. Kerry would win Minnesota and Michigan. The big Democratic cities in Wisconsin and Michigan usually take a long time to report. Obviously, a more comfortable victory for Mrs. Clinton could permit an earlier call. Michigan, for instance, was called when the polls closed in 2012. Mrs. Clinton’s chances in the “firewall” will depend on how much she improves among   white voters compared with how much she loses among less educated white voters. The situation is different in these states than the brute turnout contests of the racially polarized Southeast, which raises the possibility that these states could go in a different direction: A weak black turnout, for instance, may doom Mrs. Clinton in North Carolina, but she might still win Michigan if she holds up a little better than expected among white   Democrats. Similarly, it’s imaginable that Mr. Trump could stay in striking distance in these states with a surge among white   Democrats, without being able to hold off a big Hispanic vote in Florida. Pennsylvania, where polls close at 8 p. m. Eastern, could be a somewhat faster call. The state counts its vote pretty quickly. And the most Democratic parts of the state tend to report first, in contrast with many states. If Mrs. Clinton wins Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump’s path to victory starts getting very narrow. If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, she might not take the lead in the national popular vote for hours. If she barely wins the popular vote, it could be weeks before she retakes the lead. The vote count in the West Coast and the big urban centers of the Northeast and Midwest usually proceeds far more slowly than the vote count in the rural East and South. In 2012, President Obama didn’t take the popular vote lead until long after he had won the Electoral College. It led Mr. Trump to tweet that Mr. Obama had won while losing the popular vote, and say that “we should have a revolution in this country. ” A little while after that tweet, Mr. Obama took the lead, for good. He would ultimately win by almost four percentage points. A similar pattern could unfold this year, especially with the huge Democratic margin expected in California. Here’s a simple rule of thumb: if Mrs. Clinton is even within four or five points in the popular vote between 9 p. m. and 11 p. m. she’s probably going to win it. If Mrs. Clinton has carried her firewall states, or either Florida or North Carolina, she could win the presidency around 11 p. m. in the East, when polls close on the West Coast.",0,1185,16.690140845070424,71,0.2708860759493671,0,0,0,0,90.87593097741134,37.39339480127103,57.695877961700745,71.68762306610408,0.7721518987341772,0.039662447257383965,0.08016877637130802,0.0379746835443038,0.043037974683544304,0.007594936708860759,0.16286919831223629,0,0.004219409282700422,0.01350210970464135,0.10042194092827005,0,0.07763713080168777,0.0033755274261603376,0,0.02362869198312236,0.007594936708860759,0.12742616033755275,0.00590717299578059,0.05232067510548523,0.031223628691983123,0.06413502109704641,0,0,0.04219409282700422,0.02869198312236287,0.10548523206751055,0,0,0.0016877637130801688,0.027848101265822784,0,0.02278481012658228,0.02278481012658228,0,0,0.4430379746835443,0.002531645569620253,0.0008438818565400844,0,0,0.032067510548523206,0.0016877637130801688,0,0.010970464135021098,0.015189873417721518,0,0.012658227848101266,0.0008438818565400844,0.024472573839662448,0.008438818565400843,0.009282700421940928,0,0.0016877637130801688,0.026160337552742614,0.2489451476793249,0.0033755274261603376,0.0008438818565400844,0.014345991561181435,0.08354430379746836,0.02109704641350211,0.02531645569620253,0.03375527426160337,0.07172995780590717,0.12236286919831224,0.05738396624472574,0.02362869198312236,0,0.0033755274261603376,0.1831223628691983,0.0008438818565400844,0.030379746835443037,0.00590717299578059,0.005063291139240506,0.010970464135021098,0,0.0008438818565400844,0.016877637130801686,0.06329113924050633,0.1029535864978903,0,0.04556962025316456,0.0016877637130801688,0.06329113924050633,0.10464135021097046,0.11392405063291139,0.00590717299578059,0.019409282700421943,0.0008438818565400844,48.15,0,2,1,36.2,12,12.25,0,56.375,33.2,17.49,98.5,12,0,48.15,13,204.34,36.25,59.775000000000006,297.36499999999995,204.34,,0.5609737884787668,0,0.05039955842208127,0.02585122435717656,0.48996460874930897,0.24153185607680447,0.24532929391778013,0,0.599364939832534,0.46837821137359537,0.31700352901562834,0.7232920516479091,0.24153185607680447,0,0.4748606913091604,0.25649683110858196,0.1455034837809259,0.025812377836246275,0.04256372096997576,0.21174338580069993,0.8443683385116444,0.7882566141993,78
109,"The top aid official at the United Nations gave a gloomy assessment of the Syria relief effort on Monday, saying no convoy deliveries had been made to besieged areas this month and that the suffering in Aleppo, once Syria’s commercial epicenter, was the “apex of horror. ” In a briefing to the Security Council, the official, Stephen O’Brien, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said that while he welcomed Russia’s support last week for a     in Aleppo  —   as he had proposed earlier in the month  —   there had been no assurances from other combatants. “This cannot be a   offer,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Plans are in place, but we need the agreement of all parties to let us do our job. ” United Nations officials have said that the fighting in Aleppo  —   pitting Syrian government forces and their Russian backers against an array of insurgents, including Islamist militants  —   has left 275, 000 people in   eastern Aleppo completely cut off from food, water and medicine, and has severely limited aid deliveries to 1. 5 million people in   western Aleppo. Humanitarian access to hundreds of thousands of Syrians in other combat zones has been blocked by fighting, security concerns and the Syrian bureaucracy, Mr. O’Brien said, despite an international agreement reached in May to permit truck convoy deliveries. As a result, Mr. O’Brien said, no convoys were dispatched in August, despite some successful, if limited, deliveries in July. “We unfortunately appear to be, once again, in reverse gear,” Mr. O’Brien said. He described the crisis in Aleppo, portrayed in images of dead and wounded children like that of a    boy pulled from the rubble last week, as “the apex of horror at its most horrific extent of the suffering of people. ” While he said efforts were still underway to secure the proposed     in Aleppo, Mr. O’Brien expressed little hope of avoiding “a humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed and carnage in the Syrian conflict. ”",0,331,27.583333333333332,12,0.37462235649546827,0,0,0,0,98.09220055091522,26.436354481369584,82.55271515996591,30.894907207596027,0.8066465256797583,0.021148036253776436,0.02416918429003021,0.012084592145015106,0.06948640483383686,0.01812688821752266,0.20241691842900303,0.006042296072507553,0.00906344410876133,0.02416918429003021,0.08459214501510574,0,0.06042296072507553,0.015105740181268883,0,0.012084592145015106,0.00906344410876133,0.0634441087613293,0,0.08157099697885196,0.021148036253776436,0.04229607250755287,0,0.0030211480362537764,0.02416918429003021,0.00906344410876133,0.09969788519637462,0,0,0,0,0,0.00906344410876133,0.06042296072507553,0,0,0.43202416918429004,0.006042296072507553,0.02416918429003021,0,0,0.027190332326283987,0.01812688821752266,0.00906344410876133,0,0,0.006042296072507553,0.030211480362537766,0,0.015105740181268883,0.012084592145015106,0.03323262839879154,0.01812688821752266,0,0.030211480362537766,0.18126888217522658,0.012084592145015106,0,0.03323262839879154,0.04833836858006042,0.03927492447129909,0.027190332326283987,0.03625377643504532,0.045317220543806644,0.1782477341389728,0.054380664652567974,0.00906344410876133,0,0.03625377643504532,0.1691842900302115,0.0030211480362537764,0.006042296072507553,0.015105740181268883,0.00906344410876133,0.00906344410876133,0,0,0.012084592145015106,0.11782477341389729,0.1027190332326284,0,0.01812688821752266,0.0030211480362537764,0.0513595166163142,0.10574018126888217,0.11782477341389729,0.012084592145015106,0.027190332326283987,0,2,0,37,1,0,0,1.625,4,0,70.475,23,10,14,3,2,0,45,1.625,137.475,184.1,45,,0.11433841851550565,0,0.7048702079373803,0.060635704539036266,0,0,0.09493522954527585,0.20521309615767264,0,0.8197919505226473,0.5975277929028293,0.39228095605926194,0.47470607699125783,0.16223290110168398,0.7958685107378433,0,0.09531878839228976,0.003442067358610464,0.2911988985384452,0.38995975428934543,-0.8940876991196102,0.6100402457106546,43
110,"The violence that stopped Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the University of California, Berkeley this week happened after some incredibly irresponsible statements by university administrators and local politicians. [Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin tweeted that Milo’s “hate speech” was not “welcome in our community. ” UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said that the university not only opposed Milo’s views, but also his ostensibly harmful presence on campus.  Yet most of the blame must lie squarely with the rioters, who include Black Bloc anarchists and   “Antifa” ( ) activists, who exemplify the very fascism they supposedly want to resist. These groups openly and explicitly declare their intention to disrupt public gatherings where conservatives  —   or, really, anyone they do not like for whatever reason  —   are scheduled to appear. They not only celebrate violence, but they come armed, masked, and prepared to fight and vandalize. Were these groups merely showing up at events to protest  —   to express their views without silencing others  —   they would be perfectly entitled to do so. But lately, they have taken advantage of the timidity of the police  —   which they helped engineer, through their participation in the Black Lives Matter movement  —   to run amok, breaking up events and assaulting innocent people in full view of law enforcement officers and even the media. They are almost never pursued and never punished. Consider this, from the Berkeley campus newspaper, the Daily Californian: while there were three arrests made Wednesday  —    two in connection with violence earlier in the day  —   only one of them was made by campus police at the protest itself, despite the violence. As for the city police, “[a]ccording to Berkeley Police Department spokesperson Officer Byron White, the city of Berkeley did not make any arrests in connection with the protests Wednesday night,” the Daily Californian reported. The groups that showed up Wednesday seem to exist to prevent others from exercising their civil and constitutional rights of free speech and assembly. It is time to treat them the way that the Southern Poverty Law Center  —   before it busied itself with suppressing conservative opinion  —   took on the Ku Klux Klan. It filed a civil suit against the KKK under a theory of agency, wherein the organization was held collectively responsible for any and all of the crimes and civil rights violations its members committed in furtherance of its aims. In this case, that would mean holding radical   groups collectively accountable for damage and civil rights violations by individuals at any particular protest  —   whether of Milo in Berkeley or Gavin McInnes in New York. An objection might be raised: these groups are  . That is, they are just a bunch of kids with Twitter accounts. Unlike the KKK, which had a national headquarters that it was forced to hand over to a black woman because of a $7 million civil judgment over the murder of her son, there are no assets to seize, no institutions to shut down, no one financially liable. Well, maybe. In at least some cases, there is a paper trail connecting disruptive protests to large,   organizations. In October 2016, Breitbart News reported that the George   Democracy Alliance had funded   groups with “materials, food, supplies, stipends and bail funds to sustain and escalate their disruption of business as usual. ” A document obtained by Breitbart News showed the Democracy Alliance taking credit for participating in the “uprising in Baltimore. ” It is well past time for the government, or conservative legal foundations, to pursue the donors behind groups that proudly and deliberately prevent others from exercising their civil rights. And it is time to shame them: the black masks of the Black Bloc and   “Antifa” activists should be regarded like the white hoods of the Klan  —   as the uniforms of extremist hatred. Joel B.

111,"October 31, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Aleksandr Khrolenko, R IA Analytics -  translated by J. Arnoldski -  Hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians. Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. In July 2013, according to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand.  In October 2014, the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200,000.  By October 2015, according to UN figures, the number of killed in Syria was more than 240,000. In September 2016, the UN officially presented the figure of 300,000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees. According to the Dubai news channel “Al-Arabiya,” in October 2015, the number of killed had already surpassed 250,000. The New York Times produced similar figures. After the beginning of the Russian air force’s operation in Syria, the figures of casualties presented by Western sources did not change for the better. Of course, the countries participating in the conflict “correct” the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the Supervisory Board on Human Rights of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights created by the opposition. How objective are these disseminated figures?  The Russian Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences has conducted its own study using data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Syria. This was reported at a press conference entitled “Syria: The Thorny Path to Reconciliation” at the Russia Today media agency by the UN’s senior advisor and representative on Syria, Russian Academy of Science correspondent Vitaliy Naumkin.  In 2011, the population of Syria amounted to 22.51 million people. According to the figures of the Syrian Central Statistical Bureau, the Syrian Arab Republic’s population has declined to 17.87 million.  Given the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees, the total number for today was supposed to be 24.64 million people. As of October 20th, 2016, the number of Syrian citizens (including emigrants) is 24.54 million.  Given correct calculations, the number of Syrians killed over five years of war has been determined, taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left Syria as refugees. According to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the total number of Syrians killed is 105,000. The losses of the government army and militia amount to 45,000. 24,000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed, and 35,000 civilians have been killed. The largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the so-called “moderate opposition.” Around 18,000 in Syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries.  Earlier, the ex-head of the Israeli secret services Nativ, Yaakov Kedmi, presented almost identical figures of Syrian losses (around 40,000 civilians). American assessments, as a rule, range from several hundred thousand to millions killed, which is beyond the boundaries of reality. But the point is not even in the statistics. The death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war. American lies on the number of people killed in Syria is doubly disgusting because it is the US that developed and attempted to realize regime-change projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of Middle Eastern and African “rouge states” by means of terrorists from “moderate oppositions” and fomenting civil wars... The American coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on ISIS in Iraq. And yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population. During the Iraq War (2003-2011), 460,000 Iraqis were killed. The assault on Mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population. Palestinian political analyst Azzam Abu Saud remarked in the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen:  “The US has made a mass of mistakes in Syria. The war in Syria never would have been so bloody if the US had not supplied weapons to rebels. The US, in addition, created the Islamic State, which has now spun out of their control.” Another Norwegian publication, ABC Nyheter , adds: “The US claims that only 55 civilians and 45,000 militants from ISIS and other militant Islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11,000 coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria since 2014…Even when the American leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq and their photographs, they refuse to acknowledge their deaths.”  The Russian approach to resolving the Syrian and other Middle Eastern conflicts remains the same: there is no military solution. Success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation.

112,"It was around 10 a. m. on a   summer morning, and James Altucher, perhaps the world’s least likely success guru, was packing his worldly possessions, about 15 items, into a small canvas   bag. “If I were to die, my kids get this bag,” Mr. Altucher said sardonically as he packed away his laptop, iPad, three sets of chinos, three   and a Ziploc bag filled with $4, 000 worth of $2 bills (“People always remember you if you tip with $2 bills,” he said) and departed a friend’s loft on East 20th Street. A few months ago, the boyish    let the lease expire on his Cold Spring, N. Y. apartment, and dumped or donated virtually everything he owned, more than 40 garbage bags of sheets, dishes, clothes, books, his college diploma, even childhood photo albums. Since then, he’s been bouncing among friends’ apartments and Airbnb rentals. It is not that he is down on his luck. Several of the 16 books he has written, including his 2013   manifesto, “Choose Yourself,” continue to sell briskly. His weekly podcasts, “The James Altucher Show,” featuring interviews with notables as diverse as Ron Paul and Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew, and “Question of the Day,” with Stephen Dubner, are downloaded about two million times a month. Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last   this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a     guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream  —   the   college diploma, the corner office, the   home  —   seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them. “I have ambition,” he said, “to have no ambition. ” “In the past 25 years, income has gone down for the      student loan debt is at an   high,” Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. “We had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed. ” Mr. Altucher’s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump. But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his   conclusions. College, he says, is a waste of money. Although he graduated from Cornell, Mr. Altucher argues that the college degree has become a costly luxury in a world where millennials feel like debt serfs and   professional jobs are scarce. In a 2012   book, “40 Alternatives to College,” he argued that young adults could travel the world, educate themselves online and start a business with the same $200, 000 they may spend on college. Investing the money with even a 5 percent return would offer greater financial benefit over the course of a lifetime, he wrote in a  blog post. Similarly, he believes homeownership is a   foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry. “It’s a total scam,” he said in an online interview. “Nobody should put more than 5 to 10 percent of their portfolio, their assets, in any one investment. But when people buy a home, they go crazy. They put like 50, 60, 70 percent of their net worth into this one investment. It’s illiquid, so when times are hard, you can’t sell it. ” And he think stocks are a racket. It’s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher’s own   life. In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley   whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a   company, Reset Inc. that counted Sony and Miramax as clients. Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010) were living in a    loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1. 8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker. The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. “Nobody should feel sorry for me,” he said. “I was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out. ” As his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001). To reclaim his wealth, he set his sights on the stock market. He read more than a hundred books on investing, and eventually wrangled a job writing for James Cramer’s site, TheStreet, and later The Financial Times. Before long, his trademark hairdo, which looks like carnival cotton candy spun from steel wool, was a familiar sight on CNBC. But his fortunes crumbled once again during the financial crisis that began in 2008. The hedge fund he started ran out of gas, various   withered, writing gigs dried up. With few options open, he decided to chronicle his failures on a personal blog, which he named Altucher Confidential. “I just said, ‘I’ve made every mistake in the book: Here’s what they are,’” Mr. Altucher said. To Wall Street friends, he seemed like Howard Beale, the anchorman in “Network” who had a meltdown  . Instead of touting the latest hot mutual fund, he wrote posts like “10 Reasons You Should Never Own Stocks Again. ” (Reason No. 1: You’re not that good at it.) He confessed thoughts of suicide. “Financial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,” Mr. Altucher said. “I had friends I hadn’t talked to since high school call me and say, ‘Hey, are you O. K.?’” He soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out. “The No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is ‘I want to die,’” Mr. Altucher said. But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N. J. is like the   Robbins, the strapping   star. His   appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his     “life hacker” experiments. There was “the 5 p. m. diet,” in which he eats nothing after that time (“Your face gets more angular. I’ve seen it happen. Not just with me. With everyone on this   diet”). There was “the alien trick” to beat anxiety, in which he pretends to be an alien and wake up every day on another planet with a new body (“I have no worries because tomorrow I will be in a new body. No envies. No worries. Only new things to explore”). There was his zombie email gimmick, when he would respond to unread emails from seven years ago: “Sure! I’ll have coffee today” (“People laugh and all is forgiven,” he said). By writing candidly about his own triumphs and flameouts, Mr. Altucher “shows readers how they can succeed despite their flaws, not because of a lack of flaws,” said Tim Ferriss, author of the   “ ”   series. “This is hugely refreshing in a world of     gurus who are all forced smiles and  . ” It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. “I am an optimist,” he said. “There’s a great novel from the ‘60s by Richard Fariña called ‘Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.’ Basically, I’ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time. ” His philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in “Choose Yourself,” which he summarized over lunch like this: “If you don’t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty. ” Chapters include “How to Be Less Stupid” (“I lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful”) and “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People” (procrastination, he writes, “is your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing”). A key tenet of the book is the Daily Practice, a wellness regimen that comprises the physical (eat well, try to go to sleep by 9 p. m. and rise by 5 a. m. break a sweat for at least 10 minutes a day) emotional (be around people you love, who love you) mental (write a list of 10 ideas each day to exercise the “idea muscle” before it atrophies) and spiritual (feel gratitude every day). He calls them the four pillars of happiness. “A chair needs four legs to be stable,” he said. And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said. You do not have to be Mark Zuckerberg, he said, to be an entrepreneur. “You can learn basic web development,” he said. “You can go to Codecademy. com, learn the basic skills in three months, then sell them on Freelancer. com, where there are millions of jobs. I know    who are making a few thousand dollars a month. ” Thanks to   you don’t have to be Deepak Chopra to write books. “Everybody is or can be an expert on something,” he said. “Take me: I haven’t been in the kitchen in 20 years. I hate eating vegan. But how hard would it be to read every book on veganism, buy some ingredients, write up a little book: ‘The  ’s Vegan Cookbook’?” He would know. “Choose Yourself,” which Mr. Altucher   on Amazon, sold more than a   copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal’s   list. His fans swear by him. One reader, Beck Power, recently wrote an essay on Medium about how he inspired her to ditch a frustrating job to start her own online travel business. “I dance in my underwear,” she wrote. “I don’t have panic attacks anymore. ” A talk he gave at a London church last year drew about 1, 000 people, and fans have organized “Choose Yourself” meetups in cities around the world. On LinkedIn, where he publishes original free essays, Mr. Altucher has more than 485, 000 followers and is ranked the No. 4 “influencer,” after Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Mohamed A.   the financier and author. “He’s the Oprah of the internet,” said Kamal Ravikant, a tech entrepreneur who wrote the   Amazon best seller “Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It. ” Unlike most gurus, “James is on a very personal journey, allowing his readers and listeners to experience it in real time,” said Brian Koppelman, a creator of Showtime’s “Billions,” who also moderates “The Moment,” a podcast on Slate. “He’s telling you the story on Saturday, on Sunday he’s talking about how it failed, and on Monday he’s talking about doing it a different way. ” Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. “I am not a   guy at all,” he said. “Advice is autobiography,” he added. “I only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not. ” Besides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. “It’s like Mike Tyson says,” Mr. Altucher said. “‘Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. ’”",0,1940,15.03875968992248,129,0.27319587628865977,0,0,0,0,80.89416625756832,13.871507545196478,80.23654066437572,26.625773195876288,0.8530927835051546,0.013402061855670102,0.04536082474226804,0.03711340206185567,0.03350515463917526,0.006701030927835051,0.2597938144329897,0.007216494845360825,0.002577319587628866,0.01907216494845361,0.07525773195876288,0.0005154639175257732,0.07061855670103093,0.020618556701030927,0.005670103092783505,0.012371134020618556,0.012371134020618556,0.08762886597938144,0.003092783505154639,0.08247422680412371,0.032474226804123714,0.04536082474226804,0,0.002061855670103093,0.021649484536082474,0.00979381443298969,0.05360824742268041,0.0005154639175257732,0.0010309278350515464,0.005670103092783505,0.002061855670103093,0,0.008247422680412371,0.050515463917525774,0.0036082474226804126,0.0036082474226804126,0.4778350515463918,0.007731958762886598,0.015463917525773196,0.006701030927835051,0.020618556701030927,0.040721649484536084,0.002577319587628866,0.007216494845360825,0.023711340206185566,0.017010309278350514,0.015979381443298968,0.05309278350515464,0.0288659793814433,0.01288659793814433,0.015463917525773196,0.015979381443298968,0.0010309278350515464,0.0005154639175257732,0.04020618556701031,0.26958762886597937,0.006185567010309278,0.006701030927835051,0.0288659793814433,0.07525773195876288,0.09123711340206185,0.08969072164948454,0.016494845360824743,0.027835051546391754,0.13659793814432988,0.13041237113402063,0.02268041237113402,0.0010309278350515464,0.0654639175257732,0.13298969072164948,0.002577319587628866,0.010309278350515464,0.003092783505154639,0.002577319587628866,0.007216494845360825,0,0,0.0443298969072165,0.1283505154639175,0.07010309278350516,0.0005154639175257732,0.016494845360824743,0.00979381443298969,0.051030927835051546,0.14690721649484537,0.14536082474226805,0.0005154639175257732,0.05257731958762887,0.01443298969072165,41.605000000000004,7,107.55,2,15.73,17,22,66.425,9,66,36.43,42,35,0,41.605000000000004,3,173.035,59,250.425,471.46000000000004,173.035,,0.45027689590145314,0.12112046731632091,0.6792186852428308,0.0378833077614916,0.236457080802384,0.2507607624380707,0.30222395454657724,0.5666757929847573,0.1505175284398602,0.5650989717404968,0.4176617116021373,0.4526169321882959,0.40795536080298245,0,0.5415470354822838,0.05576861189825108,0.07561198360469486,0.025781529937162984,0.10942948533074644,0.20601627295211627,-0.6830142330261278,0.7939837270478838,123
113,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday reiterating the administration’s commitment to religious liberty and authorizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to issue guidance for all federal agencies. [The expected order did not go as far as some news outlets had earlier reported it might. The Nation reported a leaked February draft that would have “create[d] wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious objections to   marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity. ”  The text of the actual order hands authority to issue guidance on federal religious liberty law for all federal agencies to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The protection of religious freedom has been seen as a priority for the new   leadership at the Department of Justice. Due to the broad interpretive power of federal agencies, this guidance authorization could yield major changes in federal policy as it relates to the exercise of religious beliefs. For example, the Justice Department, through existing authority, has already been able to halt the implementation of the previous administration’s transgender policy for schools. The order also specifies that the Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies should not pursue adverse action, most prominently revocation of   status, based on the speech of religious individuals and organizations in relation to moral and political issues not “ordinarily   …     treated as participation   …     in a political campaign. ” This language may give religious leaders more leeway in speech on articles of faith, like biblical positions on homosexuality, marriage, and transsexualism, that have entered the public discourse as   political issues, without fear of losing their tax status. The order also directs the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to revisit regulations issued by their agencies relating to “ ” mandates under Obamacare. The specific section referenced in the order has been used by these agencies to require religious employers to provide contraceptives and other types of services in contravention of their beliefs.",0,319,29,11,0.45768025078369906,0,0,0,0,98.4197449355918,11.497126436781608,58.67060525681215,49.078369905956116,0.8056426332288401,0.0219435736677116,0.05642633228840126,0.009404388714733543,0.03134796238244514,0.009404388714733543,0.12539184952978055,0,0.003134796238244514,0.006269592476489028,0.08463949843260188,0,0.047021943573667714,0.018808777429467086,0.003134796238244514,0.012539184952978056,0.012539184952978056,0.09090909090909091,0,0.050156739811912224,0.03134796238244514,0.05642633228840126,0,0,0.018808777429467086,0.012539184952978056,0.11912225705329153,0,0.006269592476489028,0.003134796238244514,0,0,0.009404388714733543,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0.4043887147335423,0.009404388714733543,0.006269592476489028,0,0,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0.0219435736677116,0.003134796238244514,0.003134796238244514,0,0.009404388714733543,0.012539184952978056,0.012539184952978056,0.009404388714733543,0,0,0,0.15047021943573669,0.009404388714733543,0,0.012539184952978056,0.04075235109717868,0.16614420062695925,0.009404388714733543,0.0219435736677116,0.09404388714733543,0.1786833855799373,0.0438871473354232,0.018808777429467086,0,0.018808777429467086,0.109717868338558,0.04075235109717868,0,0.009404388714733543,0.003134796238244514,0.003134796238244514,0,0.009404388714733543,0,0.05329153605015674,0.05642633228840126,0,0.012539184952978056,0.009404388714733543,0.0219435736677116,0.06896551724137931,0.07523510971786834,0,0.11598746081504702,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,10,12,10,0,4,0,36,0,15,48,36,,0.21239994067041815,0,0.21239994067041815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3206244375399958,0.40269974784927715,0.4472205748723146,0.40269974784927715,0,0.21239994067041815,0,0.10315186246418338,0,0.04297994269340974,0.13753581661891118,0.6669188576563992,0.8624641833810889,18

Que ella propuso a Chlimper y Cuba lo confesó el congresista fujimorista Miguel Ángel Torres Morales, al declarar sin ambages al periódico Perú 21, el 2 de noviembre del año en curso. ¡Keiko pidió ayer y tuvo efecto al día siguiente, por una suerte de arte congresal de birlibirloque, manumitido, porque así opera con eficacia y velocidad el fraude procesal (Art. 416, Código Penal) que ella sigilosamente puso en marcha!No dijo Torres Morales si tal proposición de Keiko Fujimori fue oralmente, por escrito, por fax o tuit, ni ante qué autoridad u órgano del Congreso lo hizo, aunque se sabe que fue puesta en conocimiento de la Junta de Portavoces del Congreso, que preside Luz Salgado, recién ese mismo día, 2-11-2016, a las 4 de la tarde, y la meteórica y espasmódica elección fue al día siguiente, 3-11-2016, en horas de la mañana, en menos de 24 horas, sin debate alguno en el Pleno, sin que los congresistas votantes tengan entre manos el Currículum Vitae, o siquiera algunos documentos, que permitieran apreciar o escudriñar sobre si los candidatos propuestos tenían o no los requisitos que la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva exige, como son “reconocida solvencia moral” y una “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”, y que “no representen a entidad o interés particular alguno”. Obviamente, estos requisitos deben acreditarse con documentos, no deducirse, y no inferirse del aire, por tratarse de hechos macizos, sostenidos en el tiempo, tampoco supeditarse el voto a consignas partidarias, amén de la subida trascendencia del elegido.PETITORIOQue, en estricta aplicación del Artículo 40° del Código Procesal Constitucional que permite interponer demanda de amparo, a “cualquier persona”, por violaciones a los “derechos difusos que gocen de reconocimiento constitucional” (como al aire, al agua, al medio ambiente, al patrimonio cultural e histórico, al legítimo ejercicio de la función pública, a la institucionalidad con cabal asidero constitucional, legal y reglamentario, si acaso alguien los ha logrado contaminar o averiar), interpongo esta demanda de amparo por la afectación o lesión, que agravia al Estado o a la sociedad en general, de los siguientes derechos constitucionales:1.- a contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente; 2.- al voto congresal válido, con apego a Constitución Política, Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva y al Reglamento del Congreso; y 3.- a la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso a la información pública.En consecuencia, solicito que, reponiéndose las cosas al estado anterior a la violación de los derechos denunciada, se declare la NULIDAD (dejar sin efecto) de la Resolución Legislativa N° 008-2016-2017-CR, de 27-10-2016, publicada en El Peruano, el 28-10-2016 y del Procedimiento Especial Parlamentario que le sirve de antecedente, de la misma fecha, donde se ¡omitió adrede el debate! y se adoptó ¡acuerdos, vía votación ilegítima, sin previo debate!, que el Reglamento del Congreso exige (Artículo 64°), pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento, por estar previstos en normas especiales, atinentes precisamente a la elección de los miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva que le compete al Congreso, tal como lo prevé el Artículo 86° de nuestra Carta Política.FUNDAMENTOS DE HECHO y JURÍDICOS1.- Derecho a contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamenteEl Artículo 86° de la Constitución Política se ocupa expresamente de la elección, por el Congreso, de tres (3) miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva. Por lo tanto, los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección o elección sea minuciosa, ponderada, responsable y legítima, contando con los elementos de juicio del caso. No se elige a ciegas, por consignas inalámbricas, sin verle la cara al elegido, sin escucharlo y sin examinar quién es, como en realidad se hizo. ¡Se violó, pues, con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional!Como quiera que la propia Constitución Política no consigna otros ingredientes de tal elección, ella misma se remite a que sea el Reglamento del Congreso el que la desarrolle. De eso se ocupa el Artículo 94° de la misma Carta Política, cuando establece: “El Congreso elabora y aprueba su Reglamento, que tiene fuerza de ley”. Con este Reglamento el Congreso opera, actúa o funciona y no a discreción de la presidenta, o pero aún de una persona particular como Keiko Fujimori.Con tal sentido y propósito el aludido y vigente Reglamento del Congreso trata expresamente de la elección de esos tres directores, en un llamado “procedimiento parlamentario especial”, el mismo que ha sido burlado, transgredido o violado, pese a su asidero constitucional y su indiscutido rango legal. Veamos lo que establece su Artículo 64°, inciso c, del “procedimiento especial”, como uno de los 3 “procedimientos parlamentarios”:“Los procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del Congreso destinados a producir leyes y resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político y designaciones y nombramientos. Pueden ser:a.- Procedimiento Legislativo; que comprende el debate y aprobación de leyes ordinarias, leyes orgánicas, leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada, leyes presupuestales y financieras, leyes de demarcación territorial, leyes de reforma de la Constitución Política, del Reglamento del Congreso y de resoluciones legislativas. b.- Procedimientos del Control Político; que comprende la investidura del Consejo de Ministros, la interpelación a los Ministros, la invitación a los Ministros para que informen, las preguntas a los Ministros, la solicitud de información a los Ministros y a la administración en general, la censura y la extensión de confianza a los Ministros, la investigación sobre cualquier asunto de interés público, la dación de cuenta y el antejuicio político.c.- Procedimientos Especiales; que comprende la designación del Contralor, la elección del Defensor del Pueblo, de los miembros del Tribunal Constitucional y de 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, así como la ratificación del Presidente de dicho Banco y del Superintendente de Banca y Seguros”. (Artículo modificado aprobado por el Pleno del Congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998).En consecuencia, el “procedimiento especial”, donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión, vulneró o violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este Artículo 64° del Reglamento del Congreso, aplicable a aquél, respecto de todo “procedimiento parlamentario”, que es definido como el “conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del Congreso destinados a producir...resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político y designaciones y nombramientos”.Lo real y apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección ¡no hubo debate alguno!, por lo que no se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron o escogieron a quienes tenían una “reconocida solvencia moral” o quizá “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”. ¡Todo fue un remedo!Como se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27-10-2016 ¡no se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario!, sino en uno trucado, ¡sin promover el debate!, y, además, ¡sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate!Por lo tanto, no solo se transgredió el Artículo 86° de la Constitución Política, sino también la primera parte y además el inciso c del Artículo 64 del Reglamento del Congreso, de expreso fundamento constitucional, con lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda, de la que formo parte, resultó agraviada en su derecho a contar con funcionarios del Banco Central de Reserva constitucional, legal y reglamentariamente elegidos.¡Por ende, los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos: José Chlimper Ackerman, Rafael Rey Rey y Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, frente a una proposición de Keiko Fujimori con fraude procesal, son ilegítimos!2.- Derecho al voto congresal válido, con apego a Constitución Política, Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva y Reglamento del CongresoComo se sabe la elección de los 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva fue por 84 votos, la de Elmer Cuba; por 72, la de José Chlimper; y por 71, la de Rafael Rey. Ningún guarismo de esa votación puede considerarse válido, legítimo, porque ninguno de los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado, distribuido a cada uno de los parlamentarios y examinada como fundamento de su voto. La propia misteriosa proposición de dos candidaturas por Keiko Fujimori sabemos que no apareja ningún documento de los candidatos, pese a que la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva, en su Artículo 11°, exige como requisitos, de los que aspiren a ser miembros del Directorio del Banco, tener “reconocida solvencia moral” y una “amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas”. Se trata de elementos reales, de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí, para analizar, contrastar, evaluar y decidir su voto con apego a derecho, sin falsear su decisión a través del voto no informado o por intereses vitandos que agreden al país. Reza el violado y desacatado, al votar inválidamente, Artículo 11° de la citada Ley Orgánica: “ Los Directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral y poseer amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas. No representan a entidad o interés particular alguno y su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad y las funciones del Banco”. Si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron, dentro del llevado a cabo “procedimiento especial parlamentario”, al que hemos antes glosado, ningún documento de los 3 propuestos, 2 por Keiko y otro dizque por el APRA, ni hubo debate alguno –el cual se obvió adrede- respecto de sus calidades personales y profesionales, el voto que emitieron fue ciego, inducido por el mentado fraude, sin deliberación mental alguna, al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos reales sobre esa “reconocida solvencia moral”, la necesaria “amplia competencia” y además la “amplia experiencia” que deben favorecer a cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio, válidamente emitido. ¡Si los hechos-requisitos y su prueba concomitante no están ante sí del congresista votante, su voto resulta viciado, por ende ilegítimo y nulo!3.- Derecho a la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso a la información pública.Todo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elección de estos 3 directores del BCRP fue transparente; todo fue turbio, de principio a fin, con un clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada Keiko Fujimori. Tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por Keiko Fujimori, el día 26-10-2016, un día antes de la elección, sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue, ante una Junta de Portavoces que no recibió ni vio los Currículum Vitae de los propuestos; así como la aluvional votación llevada a cabo el día siguiente, el jueves 27-10-2016, sin examinar ningún documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige a los candidatos y sin el debate que el Artículo 64° del Reglamento del Congreso requiere para esta elección específica, en un procedimiento parlamentario especial, en relación a las calidades personales y profesionales, de los 3 futuros miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, no reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar a los actos del Estado, como éste del Congreso, que prevé y regula la Ley 27806, o Ley de Transparencia, a fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso a la información que consagra el numeral 5 del Artículo 2 de la Constitución Política.Cuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión no son transparentes, como en efecto no lo han sido, el derecho fundamental a la información pública resulta vulnerado, lo cual debe ser reparado.¿Fue la bravura de una bravísima KEIKO, su audacia o un interés nefando que la llevó a proponer con fraude a miembros del BCRP? ¡Por lo menos, se sabe que fue Keiko Fujimori quien propuso, ¿oralmente o por escrito?, a su secretario general de su partido político, José Chlimper y a su ocasional asesor Elmer Cuba, como directores del BCRP, ambos activistas de su campaña electoral presidencial última, y ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chistó, rechistó, ni hizo amago de mueca alguna, todos doblegaron la cerviz y designaron, de un día a otro, mediante su voto, a los propuestos, sin trámite ni debate alguno, ciegamente, sin examen de requisitos legales y sin tener a la vista a semejantes candidatos, ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitada!¿Tiene una persona particular, como Keiko Fujimori, lideresa de una agrupación partidaria, el derecho de proponer, con efectos legales e inmediatos, en un procedimiento especial parlamentario, sin ser congresista, a directores del citado Banco, nada menos que al Secretario General de su partido Fuerza Popular y a otro activista de su reciente campaña electoral presidencial?¿Serán los propuestos, de contundente actuación político partidaria, las personas independientes que contribuyan a la autonomía que requiere el BCRP sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad de una sana política bancaria y monetaria en particular?¡Lo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso a estos 2 candidatos, su atento y comedido lugarteniente congresista Miguel Torres Morales, hijo de un antiguo fujimorista, ultramontano, Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, ya fallecido; pero que dejó a su heredero universal en el Congreso y precisamente al lado o detrás de Keiko. ¡Su padre estuvo detrás de don Alberto, hoy preso!Si esta proposición fraudulenta, silenciosa y nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella, significa que Keiko Fujimori ¡maneja a su antojo a los 72 congresistas de su partido Fuerza Popular, ora directamente o por interpósita persona, como lo hacía antes Vladimiro Montesinos Torres (hoy también preso), en los años 90!Además, la proposición y decisión adoptada viola el texto expreso del Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú.INCONSTITUCIONAL, ILEGALIDAD, DELITO y PRODUCTO ILEGÍTIMOLa conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad; y el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta.Los congresistas, mayormente fujimoristas, que designaron a José Chlimper, Rafael Rey y Elmer Cuba, para integrar el directorio del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP), violaron la Constitución Política, las leyes Orgánica de dicho Banco, de Transparencia y el Reglamento del Congreso de la República, en la forma antes anotada.Cuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos, como es designar miembros del directorio del BCRP, o integrantes de otros organismos, están obligados a respetar las normas constitucionales y las legales de todo tipo y no zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad. Su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes.La Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú, en su artículo 11°, obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del Banco a quienes tienen ""reconocida solvencia moral"" y además ""amplia competencia y experiencia en economía y finanzas"", requisitos que son hechos macizos, que deben ser reales y acreditados con los documentos respectivos. El congresista que vota por alguien propuesto no puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza, deducirlos de meros dichos o inferirlos por consigna partidaria. Viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal; comete, pues, una ilegalidad, una arbitrariedad.Del mismo modo, todo parlamentario debe ""velar por el respeto de la Constitución y de las leyes"", porque así lo establece el Artículo 102°, inciso 2, de la Constitución Política. Hasta podríamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la Constitución y lo que dispone toda norma legal. Este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron con su voto a Chlimper, Rey y Cuba, como miembros del BCRP, sin que estén acreditadas las situaciones de hecho que la citada Ley Orgánica ha previsto. Violaron, por ende, esa norma constitucional que les obliga a respetar las leyes en general y la del BCRP en particular. ¡Produjeron una infracción constitucional!Esta acción judicial (proceso de amparo) debe anular el ilegal acto administrativo que surgió sobre la base de dicha ilegalidad e inconstitucionalidad y el quehacer delictivo fraudulento antes reseñado y hacer efectiva la responsabilidad de los infractores si no está cubierta por la inviolabilidad de votos y opiniones.El delito de fraude procesal que se ha cometido está previsto en el Artículo 416° del Código Penal, que sanciona el uso de cualquier medio fraudulento para obtener resolución contraria a la ley. En efecto, se violó el Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva, sin que se conozcan si los propuestos por Keiko reunían los requisitos exigidos.MEDIOS PROBATORIOSOfrezco como medio de prueba puntual, lo siguiente:a.- Copia de la Resolución Legislativa N° 008-2016-2017-CR; b.- Copia de la nota periodística de Perú 21, del 2 de noviembre del 2016. c.- 3 copias de la relación de congresistas demandados que votaron aquel 27-10-2016.ANEXOSa.- Copia del DNI del demandante, Anexo 1; b.- Copia de la Resolución Legislativa, Anexo 2; c.- Copia del periódico Perú 21 del 2-11-2016, Anexo 3; d.- 3 copias de la relación de los congresistas demandados y que votaron aquel 27-10-2016.POR TANTO:Solicito, a vuestro juzgado constitucional, admitir la presente Demanda de Amparo contra Luz Salgado Rubianes, Presidenta del Congreso, Keiko Sofía Fujimori Higuchi y otros más, tramitarla conforme a ley y declararla FUNDADA, en su oportunidad.OTROSÍ DIGO.- Pido al juzgado que se sirva requerir oficialmente la relación de los congresistas que votaron por la elección de los señores José Chlimper Ackerman, Rafael Rey Rey y Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, a quienes también los estoy demandando y el juzgado los considerará como tales, al haber cumplido sumisamente con el sentido de la proposición fraudulenta que les formuló su codemandada Keiko Sofía Fujimori Higuchi.Lo hago de este modo ya que en la web del Congreso no aparece esta relación de los congresistas que votaron del modo cuestionado. Ni siquiera es posible agenciarse del acta de la indicada sesión del Pleno de aquel aciago 27-10-2016.

115,"DAVOS, Switzerland  —   In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade, security and the mission to limit climate change, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration. That a leader of the People’s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months. His message, delivered here in the Swiss Alps at the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum, appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand. He was speaking three days before Donald J. Trump was to be inaugurated president of the United States, raising the prospect of a trade war with China, and on the same day that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain outlined plans to pursue her country’s departure from the European Union. The Chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity. He never mentioned Mr. Trump by name, nor did he even make reference to the fact that the White House is about to gain a new occupant. Yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the   has promised  —   not least, his repeated threat of steep tariffs on Chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices. In myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly   steward of openness and connectivity. Under his direction, China’s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country’s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China’s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas. Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase “economic globalization,” while avoiding unqualified “globalization,” reflecting China’s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections. Indeed, the metaphor he used to reject protectionism  —   “like locking oneself in a dark room”  —   could just as well have been used to describe China’s political path under his leadership, with the Communist Party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels Western notions such as democracy. This month, China’s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary, which he said must be “resolutely rejected. ” Not for nothing, China carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests. Steel producers around the globe complain that Beijing dumps its  steel on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials, costing jobs at mills from Italy to Indiana. But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of   workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of   Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China  —   an institution that rules in the name of   revolution  —   draped himself in the banner of globalization. None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi’s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite. For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China’s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience. “In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,” Mr. Schwab said. That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China’s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil. The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems. The growing electoral strength of populist,   Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure. These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which   people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges  —   from climate change to a weak global economy. “This appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U. K.,” said   Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. “The world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence. ” In keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi’s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements. Yet, in totality, it delivered a striking message: In an era in which the United States and Britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization, China will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade. Mr. Trump has picked as a key trade adviser the economist Peter Navarro, who has long portrayed China as a mortal threat to American prosperity. Mr. Trump has threatened to brand the country a currency manipulator, opening the door to punitive tariffs. Though Beijing has in years past maintained its currency, the renminbi, at artificially low levels to make its goods cheap on world markets, it has in recent months intervened aggressively in the other direction, propping up its value against the dollar. “China has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the RMB,” Mr. Xi said. In another implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump, the Chinese president argued forcefully for   on the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr. Trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change. “The Paris agreement was hard won,“ Mr. Xi said. “All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations. ” Mr. Xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of Chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage, posing for photos as they awaited the president’s arrival. In conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests. China relies on access to the United States, the largest consumer market on earth, as the landing place for its exports. The United States depends upon China for a vast range of finished goods. Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Chinese   giant, said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities. “I don’t think it will happen,” he said of the hostilities. “It’s going to be a disaster if it does. ” More than a decade has passed since the United States Congress effectively prevented CNOOC, a Chinese   oil company, from buying the American energy company Unocal, branding the merger a threat to national security. Fu Chengyu, CNOOC’s chief executive at that time, pointed to the treatment of the merger as an indication of American hypocrisy on free trade. But on Tuesday, as he waited for the Chinese president to deliver his address, Mr. Fu, who recently retired from another major Chinese energy company but retains a party post, expressed confidence that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump would forge common ground. “Eventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,” Mr. Fu said. “At the beginning, Trump will say something very harsh. He will try to do something punishing. But this is a   sword. Once he’s in the White House, he will see things differently. ”",0,1448,23.737704918032787,61,0.3729281767955801,0,0,0,0,98.54351118900598,13.43710465209384,74.86740331491713,25.774193548387096,0.7810773480662984,0.021408839779005526,0.04350828729281768,0.019337016574585635,0.05386740331491713,0.017955801104972375,0.1477900552486188,0.010359116022099447,0.010359116022099447,0.012430939226519336,0.10773480662983426,0.0013812154696132596,0.04558011049723757,0.004834254143646409,0.0020718232044198894,0.020718232044198894,0.008977900552486187,0.07251381215469613,0.0006906077348066298,0.055248618784530384,0.025552486187845305,0.03591160220994475,0,0.0027624309392265192,0.011740331491712707,0.006906077348066298,0.11878453038674033,0,0.0013812154696132596,0.004143646408839779,0.0013812154696132596,0,0.010359116022099447,0.026243093922651933,0,0,0.42955801104972374,0.0006906077348066298,0.011049723756906077,0.008287292817679558,0.0006906077348066298,0.04281767955801105,0.0055248618784530384,0.0020718232044198894,0.013812154696132596,0.009668508287292817,0.0055248618784530384,0.03383977900552486,0.029696132596685083,0.013812154696132596,0.007596685082872928,0.026243093922651933,0.004143646408839779,0.0006906077348066298,0.003453038674033149,0.14986187845303867,0.004834254143646409,0,0.024171270718232045,0.055248618784530384,0.09046961325966851,0.025552486187845305,0.026243093922651933,0.07458563535911603,0.16781767955801105,0.06837016574585636,0.010359116022099447,0,0.019337016574585635,0.1457182320441989,0.0013812154696132596,0.008977900552486187,0.015193370165745856,0.003453038674033149,0.007596685082872928,0,0,0.021408839779005526,0.08701657458563536,0.09461325966850828,0.0020718232044198894,0.019337016574585635,0.0013812154696132596,0.03383977900552486,0.08149171270718232,0.08494475138121547,0.0013812154696132596,0.06284530386740332,0.0006906077348066298,82,0,124.125,3,5,16,6,11,20,129.25,39.5,35,31,0,82,6,179.5,28,232.125,434.625,179.5,,0.7012832724858342,0,0.7803977985645418,0.07909619750572906,0.1252238426491463,0.3141659484339579,0.14659712023553698,0.2395027136711607,0.3641097169059991,0.787252906227067,0.5307106935216298,0.500511247978271,0.47020637138040466,0,0.45576011798873434,0.14659712023553698,0.10177900630803033,0.015876390956127296,0.13161811609610888,0.24643844354667233,-0.6805850627614926,0.7535615564533277,119

In another ten years, he would become known as the American Taliban. While in Afghanistan, he was known as Sulayman al-Faris, one of several Arabic monikers he’s used over the years. Johnny joins the jihad There are moments when one realizes one’s vacation is really starting to suck. When he was twelve, the young Lindh saw Spike Lee’s rather hagiographic film biography about Malcolm X. That began his fascination with Islam. While a teenager, he used the evocative email [email protected] and made several postings about rap music on Usenet. Sometimes he pretended to be Black, even having the nerve to “dis” Dr. Dre : $hort Dog does hip hop no glory Wack like Dr Dre and his made-up gangster stories Sellout house nigga living honkey dory Saying he’s broke in his own pool doing laps All these playground MC’s fall off like scabs Skills disappear like alaka abracadab Dr Dre’s a disgrace selling out to the talcolm He’ll be left dead and naked in the outcome Word to brother Malcolm Dre shirts and hat’s when will we see his cereal? So who’s the poseur there, anyway? I’m not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence, or cry at the abuse of the English language. When he was sixteen, he formally converted, beginning his fateful journey. Meanwhile, his family situation was on shaky ground. His father turned gay , living part-time with his male lover , and eventually divorced. John began his world travels, twice venturing to Yemen, both times for nearly a year. Later, he stayed at a Pakistani madrassa. In May 2001, he went to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban. Unfortunately for him, after September 11, American forces went to war with the Taliban. He was captured on November 25 after his unit surrendered in Kunduz. The CIA questioned him, and he claimed to be an Irishman. (That must have been an interesting conversation, perhaps “Ach, begorrah, top o’ the mornin’ to ye!” Presumably, pretending to be black again wouldn’t have gotten him very far.) Shortly after, the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising , and Lindh escaped. Hundreds died, including Mike Spann, one of his interrogators. After that, he was recaptured and—following some rough treatment, not that I’m shedding any tears about it—questioned again. He announced defiantly that he wasn’t in the Taliban, but rather Al Qaeda. His actions sealed his doom. Fighting for the Taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part. His actions after being captured were even dumber. What could he have done differently? In the beginning, he could’ve said he was interested in Islam, and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad. Then he could have lied and told them he was press-ganged into the Taliban, and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen. He could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attempt—potentially sparing many lives on both sides—as well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself. Had he given a helpful warning about the uprising, likely they would’ve concluded he was small fry and let him go. After that, he could’ve become the star of the daytime TV talk shows. Then he could’ve given speeches on the anti-war circuit, helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really aren’t that bad or whatever. Instead, he ended up faced with ten criminal charges, which could’ve meant three life sentences plus ninety years. Finally getting smart, he copped a plea for twenty years, with the possibility of three off for good behavior. Now, he’s in Federal prison, making the news back in 2012 by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer . What went wrong? As Bush the Elder put it, Lindh was “some misguided Marin County hot-tubber.” Later, he apologized profusely for the remark. Still, I have to say that Bush 41 was onto something with that one; all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts . Things could’ve been different. Lindh didn’t have to become a renegade. If he’d made other choices, he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society, rather than counting the days in a prison cell. Still, his environment bears some responsibility for what he became. He was raised in the Catholic faith, but a stronger grounding in it—as well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about Islam to balance out the picture —might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad. (A liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all that’s bad. Or has liberalism become too wishy-washy to assert its own values?) There wasn’t much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path; his mother converted to Buddhism and his father left for the gay community. For that matter, if he had acquired an appreciation for good music—be it Mozart or Metallica—perhaps he wouldn’t have been so fascinated by irritating rap music. What kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be Black and laughably accuses Dr. Dre of selling out? On that note, as for Malcolm X, didn’t Lindh have some cultural icons of his own? I have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own Irish-American heritage. All this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an “ anything goes ” environment. Islam speaks in absolutes, enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct, and they fight for what they believe in. (I can’t fault them too much for that, although I disagree with their theology and actions on many points.) Going further, Islam offers paradise for believers—promising seventy virgins to their martyrs—and eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned; there’s nothing wishy-washy about it. Indeed, embracing radical Islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the “anything goes” world view. I certainly don’t agree with Lindh’s choices, but I can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism . This certainly isn’t the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Jane Fonda’s North Vietnam adventure comes to mind; an action she now regrets. More recently, there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in Iraq for their pal Saddam. For all their posturing, none of them got themselves blown up over there. (Leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified, 500 fewer Social Justice Warriors would’ve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit.) Then there’s the odd case of Matthew Todd Miller , a Californian who went to North Korea, tore up his visa, and announced he was seeking political asylum. That one’s an iffy case though; later he said “I just wanted to speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things.” Kids these days… In summary Don’t let this happen to our youth. They must not grow up culturally bereft. In times past, children were taught about their country’s heritage, instructed in their culture, and pride in their nation was instilled in them. It was a given that these were presented as good things. These days—at least in much of the Western world—this isn’t happening. We can’t count on the educational system—and certainly the media—to do that any more. Because of decades of cultural Marxism , young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization. “All societies, beliefs, and ways of life are equal, except yours are terrible.” Those who don’t see through that baloney end up rootless, alienated, and disconnected from their own culture. Some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful. This is basically what Social Justice Weenies think, something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue. This will have to change, of course. Hopefully, the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural Marxism are standing in the unemployment line. For now, we’ll have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing, and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity. Teach them about their roots and why that’s important. Don’t let the TV be your child’s babysitter. “Anything goes” is not a standard by which to raise our youth.",1,1581,18.38372093023256,86,0.28526249209361165,0,0,0,0,72.32804433601397,9.392596404335384,76.83978302953635,22.82191938358921,0.8292220113851992,0.0056925996204933585,0.04554079696394687,0.044275774826059454,0.053763440860215055,0.015180265654648957,0.17900063251106893,0.010752688172043012,0.002530044275774826,0.030360531309297913,0.061353573687539534,0.001265022137887413,0.08538899430740038,0.015812776723592662,0.003795066413662239,0.01454775458570525,0.010752688172043012,0.10879190385831752,0.0006325110689437065,0.05502846299810247,0.02530044275774826,0.051233396584440226,0.007590132827324478,0.0031625553447185324,0.027830487033523088,0.017710309930423784,0.06578115117014548,0.0006325110689437065,0.006325110689437065,0.002530044275774826,0.001265022137887413,0.0006325110689437065,0.010120177103099304,0.05502846299810247,0.002530044275774826,0.002530044275774826,0.4838709677419355,0.008222643896268185,0.010120177103099304,0.0018975332068311196,0.008855154965211892,0.044275774826059454,0.008855154965211892,0.001265022137887413,0.02530044275774826,0.017077798861480076,0.010120177103099304,0.055660974067046176,0.002530044275774826,0.02403542061986085,0.017077798861480076,0.027830487033523088,0.001265022137887413,0.0018975332068311196,0.018342820999367487,0.24857685009487665,0.011385199240986717,0.002530044275774826,0.022137887413029727,0.05313092979127135,0.04237824161922834,0.08349146110056926,0.025932953826691967,0.03289057558507274,0.137887413029728,0.12776723592662872,0.02403542061986085,0.004427577482605946,0.010120177103099304,0.13851992409867173,0.013915243516761544,0.006957621758380772,0.007590132827324478,0.006325110689437065,0.008855154965211892,0.0031625553447185324,0.0031625553447185324,0.05186590765338393,0.1252371916508539,0.06641366223908918,0.003795066413662239,0.026565464895635674,0.017077798861480076,0.04933586337760911,0.13219481340923467,0.1461100569259962,0.003795066413662239,0.01265022137887413,0.0018975332068311196,40.455,14.875,167.7,16.125,19.5,40.730000000000004,16,88.525,1.83,81.625,38.2,33.975,30,8,40.455,0,177.49499999999998,56.730000000000004,350.6,568.0950000000001,177.49499999999998,,0.49378793474805155,0.26398507424739603,0.8017291621647864,0.2799582075286381,0.3198143032504431,0.49548140720741846,0.2783921607284748,0.6809726293755077,0.042260465946271475,0.6630902027333313,0.4794604977536351,0.450310847450766,0.4197396112191015,0.16170474737514706,0.724153862628226,0,0.08852199022988934,0.02829292377667891,0.1748545580134607,0.2833257277086622,-0.8551319123132123,0.7166742722913377,144
117,"Dueling court rulings left the fate of a presidential vote recount in Michigan uncertain on Tuesday night, and elections officials in the state said they were “seeking clarity about the next steps. ” A recount of last month’s election had already begun in parts of Michigan, one of three closely contested states where Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential nominee, had called for new counts, when the seemingly conflicting legal decisions emerged late Tuesday from state and federal courts in Michigan. Ms. Stein has cited concerns about computer hacking and the reliability of voting machines, setting off legal fights with lawyers for   Donald J. Trump, his campaign and his allies, who view the recounts as a needless and expensive tactic. A panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals found that Ms. Stein, who finished a distant fourth to Mr. Trump in the election, had not met the state’s requirements for a recount because she had no chance of winning. The panel concluded that the Michigan Board of State Canvassers ought not to have permitted a recount to go forward because Ms. Stein, given the size of the vote for her, could not be deemed “aggrieved,” as required for a recount under state election law. Yet in a separate decision, also announced late Tuesday, a federal appeals court turned down requests from the state’s Republican Party and from Bill Schuette, the state’s attorney general, to block a federal court ruling that had cleared the way for the recount to proceed more swiftly than expected. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that Mark A. Goldsmith, a Federal District Court judge, had not violated his discretion when he ordered the recount to go forward on Monday in order to get it done by Electoral College deadlines in  . Even as the recount has proceeded in conference halls and fairgrounds around the state, the legal fight has been fierce. By late Tuesday, even some officials leading the   recounts seemed puzzled about what the latest court rulings would mean for counting the rest of the ballots. In at least one county, Ingham, Barb Byrum, the county clerk, said her workers were finished with their count. In Pennsylvania, another of the states where Ms. Stein has pressed for a recount, lawyers for Ms. Stein went to federal court on Monday to ask a judge to order a recount on constitutional grounds. Republicans are countering the petition, and a decision is pending. And in Wisconsin, a recount was in its sixth day and proceeding as scheduled, with little change in the statewide results as they were reported on election night. A lawsuit seeking to halt the recount, filed late last week by two “super PACs” supporting Mr. Trump and by a private citizen, is still pending a judge has scheduled a hearing for Friday.",0,475,31.666666666666668,15,0.3389473684210526,0,0,0,0,98.60379809818664,27.842690058479526,67.07518796992481,29.284936479128856,0.7178947368421053,0.008421052631578947,0.042105263157894736,0.029473684210526315,0.018947368421052633,0.008421052631578947,0.13894736842105262,0.00631578947368421,0.002105263157894737,0.010526315789473684,0.11578947368421053,0,0.05263157894736842,0,0,0.01263157894736842,0,0.061052631578947365,0,0.06736842105263158,0.018947368421052633,0.04421052631578947,0,0,0.01263157894736842,0.008421052631578947,0.07368421052631578,0,0,0.002105263157894737,0.016842105263157894,0,0.004210526315789474,0.056842105263157895,0,0,0.4336842105263158,0,0.00631578947368421,0,0,0.021052631578947368,0,0,0.018947368421052633,0.014736842105263158,0.004210526315789474,0.01263157894736842,0.004210526315789474,0.018947368421052633,0.010526315789473684,0.008421052631578947,0,0,0.014736842105263158,0.16842105263157894,0,0,0.01263157894736842,0.04842105263157895,0.05052631578947368,0.021052631578947368,0.010526315789473684,0.061052631578947365,0.16421052631578947,0.042105263157894736,0.008421052631578947,0,0.01263157894736842,0.16631578947368422,0,0.004210526315789474,0,0,0.004210526315789474,0,0,0.014736842105263158,0.06736842105263158,0.08,0,0.01263157894736842,0.00631578947368421,0.07157894736842105,0.09263157894736843,0.09473684210526316,0,0.042105263157894736,0,0,0,17,0,4,3,0,4,4.625,13,4,10,1.8,0,0,0,19.425,3,33,55.425,19.425,,0,0,0.49533066242810353,0,0.1876127897984334,0.14763410387308012,0,0.1876127897984334,0.21074927880679023,0.4287527098011759,0.1876127897984334,0.36602540378443865,0.09413975783879158,0,0.2878229343817586,0,0.03850919363631858,0.005947365812558854,0.06542102393814739,0.10987758338702482,-0.5257053717250425,0.8901224166129752,26
118,"Doubling down on his feud with the Democratic Party leadership, Senator Bernie Sanders said that if elected president, he will not reappoint Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. He made the comments during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper that is set to air on Sunday. Mr. Sanders also said he was supporting Tim Canova, a law professor who has begun an insurgent campaign against Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her South Florida congressional seat. They will face off in a primary this summer. “Well, clearly, I favor her opponent,” Mr. Sanders told Mr. Tapper. “His views are much closer to mine. ” For months, Mr. Sanders has accused the party of favoring Hillary Clinton, often calling her the “anointed candidate. ” He has criticized the party for a debate schedule that his campaign says favors Mrs. Clinton an arrangement under which Mrs. Clinton raises money for the party and the appointment of Clinton supporters as leaders of important convention committees. Most recently, he and the party have sparred over what happened at the Nevada Democratic convention a week ago. There, Sanders supporters disrupted the proceedings in a fight over delegates and the state party chairwoman was later threatened. After the party rebuked Mr. Sanders for not clearly condemning what had occurred, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of “throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning. ” This week, Ms. Wasserman Schultz pushed back against the Sanders campaign in an interview with CNN. “We’ve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama,” she told the network. “These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014. ” In a statement on Saturday, she said that “even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. ” As president, Mr. Sanders would have the ability to appoint the committee chair, though it is not likely he will get that chance, as Mrs. Clinton is close to clinching the nomination. Nevertheless, he can try to draw a little blood from Ms. Wasserman Schultz with his endorsement of her primary opponent, Mr. Canova, the underdog in the race. Mr. Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, has echoed Mr. Sanders’s messages about the need to combat economic inequalities and reform campaign finance. He has also mirrored, on a small scale, Mr. Sanders’s   model by raising more than $1 million through small donations that have averaged about $19 each. “I’m so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our progressive campaign,” Mr. Canova said in a statement on Saturday. “Like Senator Sanders, I’m running a campaign that’s truly backed by the people, not big corporations  —   one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them. ” Mr. Sanders spent Saturday campaigning across the Western states. At a rally in Vado, N. M. he offered a series of familiar attacks against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing her use of “super PACs,” her stances on trade agreements and her support of fracking. He also talked about the need to improve the poverty and high school graduation rates in the state. Mr. Sanders then went to California, where he planned to hold an evening rally in National City and where he visited International Friendship Park, an area on the United States border with Mexico. There, he walked along two large walls separating the countries with an immigration activist and Maria Puga, a woman whose husband was killed by border patrol agents as he attempted a crossing from Mexico. Mr. Sanders vowed that if elected, he will push for comprehensive immigration reform. He called a proposal by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, to build a wall along the entire border both “immoral” and “impractical. ”",0,638,19.9375,32,0.38087774294670845,0,0,0,0,94.46877643429367,9.15650957264049,84.59068517689208,70.05339963247216,0.7601880877742947,0.012539184952978056,0.034482758620689655,0.03605015673981191,0.05172413793103448,0.02037617554858934,0.20376175548589343,0.0109717868338558,0.001567398119122257,0.0109717868338558,0.09247648902821316,0,0.048589341692789965,0.003134796238244514,0.003134796238244514,0.003134796238244514,0.007836990595611285,0.061128526645768025,0,0.06739811912225706,0.0219435736677116,0.03761755485893417,0,0.001567398119122257,0.025078369905956112,0.007836990595611285,0.13793103448275862,0,0.001567398119122257,0,0.02821316614420063,0,0.007836990595611285,0.03605015673981191,0,0,0.43260188087774293,0,0.007836990595611285,0,0.0109717868338558,0.03134796238244514,0.001567398119122257,0,0.007836990595611285,0.0109717868338558,0.014106583072100314,0.05642633228840126,0.0109717868338558,0.009404388714733543,0.006269592476489028,0.014106583072100314,0,0.001567398119122257,0.0109717868338558,0.15673981191222572,0.004702194357366771,0,0.009404388714733543,0.08307210031347963,0.06739811912225706,0.06426332288401254,0.03761755485893417,0.10658307210031348,0.14576802507836992,0.09561128526645768,0.01567398119122257,0,0.03761755485893417,0.14106583072100312,0.001567398119122257,0.001567398119122257,0.001567398119122257,0,0.001567398119122257,0,0,0.047021943573667714,0.14106583072100312,0.0987460815047022,0,0.01567398119122257,0.003134796238244514,0.034482758620689655,0.08463949843260188,0.0877742946708464,0.003134796238244514,0.0438871473354232,0,26.525,0,40,1,6,10,0,19,1.83,10,4,14,36,0,26.525,1,88.35499999999999,10,61,156.35500000000002,88.35499999999999,,0.5118361874109756,0,0.6125741132772068,0.03802538541681852,0.19170418491404337,0.28330039409901914,0,0.42891112668671555,0.06745742675205472,0.28330039409901914,0.1365270594958143,0.3562502205830146,0.5872927345602237,0,0.19170418491404337,0.03802538541681852,0.11790806760480678,0.013344809869821379,0.08140334020591042,0.2086527747195922,0.6046166522417432,0.7913472252804078,45
119,"Zach Cartwright | November 11, 2016 The Democrats’ staggeringly piss-poor performance Tuesday night resulting in Donald Trump’s victory can be summed up in one word: Turnout. Hillary Clinton would have won had she focused her message more on appealing to white, working-class voters in rust belt states like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As this New York Times map of the 2012 election shows, President Obama won all of those states in 2012. Obama also won roughly 2.6 million more votes than Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Donald Trump’s narrow margin of victory in the Electoral College was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states . There was hardly any enthusiasm behind Hillary Clinton when examining exit poll results. In an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos exit polling, Times writer Sarah Jaffe found several revealing trends showing why Clinton was a poor choice for the Democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party’s nominee: 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” The numbers bear out that argument — Clinton’s turnout was lower than Obama’s turnout in both 2008 and 2012, even though she still won the popular vote this year. No matter how you slice it, Clinton wasn’t enough of a draw to make the difference, particularly in key states like Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states Obama won in 2012. As the Washington Post reported, three traditionally blue states Trump won in 2016 that Obama won in 2012 — Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — Clinton got between 5 and 15 percent fewer votes than Obama. The Democratic primaries were a harbinger of things to come in a general election matchup featuring Clinton and Trump. As US Uncut reported in March, Hillary Clinton’s victories in the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries all depended on voter turnout numbers lower than 2008 figures — the last time there was a contested Democratic primary. In all seven states Clinton won that day, each state had turnout anywhere between 4 percent and 50 percent lower than in 2008 . The data makes the argument all by itself. No amount of scapegoating heaped on Jill Stein supporters can explain Hillary Clinton losing traditional Democratic strongholds that Obama won not only once, but twice . In Detroit, Michigan, for example, Hillary Clinton got roughly 120,000 fewer votes than President Obama in 2012. Those votes made the difference in securing Trump’s victory, as Clinton lost Michigan by roughly half that number. Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell — one of the most senior officials within the Democratic Party apparatus — argued in a radio interview that even though Hillary Clinton was beloved by Democratic Party leadership, Bernie Sanders would have likely prevailed among the white, working-class rust belt constituency specifically due to his anti-establishment message. “It would be interesting to think of how Bernie Sanders would’ve done. Bernie Sanders would’ve lost a few Republicans who voted for Hillary because of some of his economic views but he would’ve fought Donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers,” Rendell said on 1210 WPHT in Philadelphia. Had the Democratic Party nominated a candidate more attuned to the mood of voters in one of the most anti-establishment elections in generations, turnout could have been much higher, and America would have averted Trump’s victory.

120,"  Russia  —   Standing ankle deep in mud in a swampy grassland more than 4, 000 miles from his home, Yuri A. Bugaev surveyed a   wasteland that the Russian government is offering to   pioneers under its own   version of the 1862 Homestead Act in the United States. “This is not really what I had in mind,” said Mr. Bugaev, who had traveled across seven time zones from St. Petersburg, Russia, to scout the possibilities for settlers in the country’s sparsely populated Far East, a territory roughly   the size of the United States. The nine Far Eastern regions targeted for settlement in the government’s land giveaway, which began on June 1, encompass more than a third of Russia but are home to only 6. 1 million people. This is just 4 percent of the country’s population and compares with the 110 million Chinese living across the border in the three provinces that make up Manchuria. Mr. Bugaev is a dedicated, if largely sedentary, Cossack, a   fraternity of Slavic warriors, freebooters and   rebels. A romantic throwback to earlier generations of Cossacks who settled and secured the borders of the Russian empire, he sees getting his Cossack brethren and other Russians to move out east as the only way to keep mostly empty Russian lands safe from China. For years, he said, he had dreamed of Russia embracing, or rather   the pioneer spirit, and he was delighted by the Kremlin’s backing of a program meant to reassert the country’s manifest destiny as a   power. All the same, he conceded that not many Russians living in the European side of Russia, who dream of a house in London or Paris, not a shack in a swamp near China, share his zeal for a new life in wild eastern regions that many associate with labor camps and convicts. “Most people these days don’t want an adventure,” he said. The Russian government, however, is intent on proving otherwise and on giving some substance to a command by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2013 that the development of Siberia and the Far East must be “our national priority for the entire 21st century. ” How to get people to settle in the Far East is a question that has preoccupied and confounded Russian rulers since the establishment of a Russian naval base on the Pacific Ocean at Okhotsk in the 17th century. Cossacks, convicts and desperate peasants have often been the only takers. In Communist times, labor camps, heavy investment in remote industrial sites and the construction of a second railroad across Siberia and the Far East revived the eastward flow of people. But this ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and residents began to drift away. A population of more than eight million dwindled by about two million. Russia’s Ministry for the Development of the Far East, the agency managing this latest development gambit, cited a survey it commissioned, saying that 20 percent of Russians would be ready to move east if given free land. Younger Russians, the ministry said, were even more enthusiastic, with more than 50 percent expressing an interest in heading east to take advantage of the offer  —   one free hectare, about two and a half acres, a person. But as often happens in Russia, grandiose hopes and plans have run far ahead of the reality on the ground, where bureaucrats, appalling weather and immense distances conspire to smother the Kremlin’s ambitions. “It is all pie in the sky,” said Vladimir V. Mishchenko, the head of the Khankaisky district, one of nine pilot areas chosen by Moscow to test the free land program. He complained that the whole thing had been dreamed up by people in Moscow who had no understanding of the Far East but needed to show the Kremlin that they were doing something. For the moment, the free land is restricted to small areas, like the Khankaisky area around   an isolated settlement north of Vladivostok, and is open only to Russians already living in the Far East. Starting in February, however, all Russian citizens can apply, and Mr. Bugaev wants to make sure he is ready to “help save Russia. ” At the start of his scouting mission, after a   flight to Vladivostok from Moscow, he found his hotel packed with Chinese, mostly tourists. Donning his Cossack fur hat, he declared his mission even more urgent than he had thought. He set off the next day for   to inspect the land on offer, driving for hours in torrential rain through sodden taiga and mostly empty villages. Undaunted, he said he thought there were enough hardy souls ready to join his organization, the Far Eastern Hectare Social Movement, a private outfit set up in St. Petersburg to drum up interest in the free land program and to organize new settlements. Its website explains that it is possible to be a pioneer without even leaving home, at least to start with. People can simply apply for free land and pool what they get so a larger plot can be developed by a few adventurous souls. If this works, those who contribute land but stay behind in St. Petersburg can move east later, after most of the hard work is done. “Virtually nobody wants to come out here right now,” Mr. Bugaev conceded, complaining that the available plots  —   about 12, 000 square yards a person  —   cannot possibly support sustainable agriculture or any other business venture. (American pioneers got more than 60 times that amount  —   160 acres  —   under the Homestead Act.) The Russian plan has been derided as a dreamy patriotic stunt cooked up by Kremlin image makers or a scam that will end up enriching officials, who have the right to take back the land after five years if they decide development targets have not been met. The Kremlin, however, has thrown its weight behind the program, set in motion this summer with a blitz of publicity on state news media presenting the Far East as an El Dorado of opportunity, and the start of a government website that allows citizens to view plots of land and make online applications. The official website went down as soon as it was unveiled, a mishap that Aleksei A. Navalny, the renowned anticorruption campaigner, said was probably a deliberate malfunction engineered by officials so they could grab the best land for themselves. Mr. Navalny, in a report last month, noted that coveted plots on the shore of a picturesque lake outside   had been snapped up by the time the website started working again. Yan P. Ovodenko, a local official, denied that the lakeside plots had all been taken. A more serious blow to Mr. Bugaev’s hopes was delivered by Mr. Mishchenko, the district head. While the area might look empty, he explained, nearly all the land is already owned or at least claimed by somebody. And even if Mr. Bugaev were to get allotted land, developing it would require cooperation from 22 different government agencies responsible for enforcing a thicket of rules and regulations. “The water code, you have to abide by it town planning code, you have to abide by it land code, you have to abide by it border area rules, you have to abide by them prescriptions of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, you have to abide by them forest regulation, you have to abide by it,” the district chief said. Of the 460 people who have applied since June 1, Mr. Mishchenko said, 390 have been rejected outright because they failed to provide the necessary information. In all, only four people, all from Vladivostok, have thus far secured plots. “For any meaningful agriculture, you need 5, 000 hectares to start off,” Mr. Mishchenko said. “And those lands don’t exist. They’ve been snapped up a long time ago. ” Undeterred by his initial finding in Khankaisky district, Mr. Bugaev pressed on. A Cossack leader in the regional administration in Vladivostok, Oleg Melnikov, assured him that the land giveaway was on track and faced no serious problems. A local company involved in agriculture also liked Mr. Bugaev’s plans for an updated version of collective farming and urged him to focus on trying to find people in St. Petersburg ready to apply for plots of land. “I think this will all work out,” Mr. Bugaev said, warily eyeing Chinese tourists crowded in the lobby of his Vladivostok hotel. “This is not just for adventure but to save Russia. ”",0,1417,23.229508196721312,61,0.3119266055045872,0,0,0,0,96.71727609017658,29.992082998726477,67.66841415465268,50.81721947776994,0.7882851093860268,0.013408609738884969,0.051517290049400144,0.030345800988002825,0.03458009880028229,0.008468595624558928,0.15031757233592097,0.0014114326040931546,0.0007057163020465773,0.008468595624558928,0.09527170077628794,0,0.05434015525758645,0.009880028228652082,0.0028228652081863093,0.0077628793225123505,0.009880028228652082,0.08045165843330981,0,0.06986591390261115,0.026817219477769938,0.043754410726887794,0,0,0.028228652081863093,0.012702893436838392,0.06986591390261115,0,0,0.004234297812279464,0,0,0.009174311926605505,0.04234297812279464,0,0,0.4509527170077629,0.0035285815102328866,0.008468595624558928,0.0035285815102328866,0.0014114326040931546,0.04022582921665491,0,0.0035285815102328866,0.011291460832745237,0.008468595624558928,0.0077628793225123505,0.028228652081863093,0.0056457304163726185,0.012702893436838392,0.008468595624558928,0.01058574453069866,0,0,0.029640084685956247,0.21312632321806635,0.004234297812279464,0.0007057163020465773,0.01834862385321101,0.051517290049400144,0.051517290049400144,0.032462949894142556,0.02399435426958363,0.04022582921665491,0.16302046577275936,0.07268877911079746,0.022582921665490474,0,0.015525758645024701,0.16937191249117856,0.0035285815102328866,0.01058574453069866,0.0035285815102328866,0.004234297812279464,0.0056457304163726185,0,0,0.019054340155257588,0.07833450952717008,0.11926605504587157,0,0.025405786873676783,0.006351446718419196,0.03881439661256175,0.11150317572335922,0.10938602681721948,0.0007057163020465773,0.032462949894142556,0.004940014114326041,14.75,0,20,10.75,21,18.28125,13,10,24.678125,28.675,40,17,21,0,14.75,0,125.053125,33.28125,98.175,245.228125,125.053125,,0.2969091352816539,0,0.3641097169059991,0.2353404857462003,0.3754794175302506,0.34356956294788343,0.27123737308363227,0.2225758785102318,0.4140164900338523,0.4508399808883795,0.5338422744056883,0.3273732252239327,0.3754794175302506,0,0.4405039478415395,0,0.07878711511617147,0.020968157932559316,0.06185311263936934,0.15450086924335465,0.5211332220396361,0.8454991307566453,75
121,"WASHINGTON  —   When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘destroy’ the Johnson Amendment, he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the   divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations. But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954,   entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their   status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it. Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas, he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954. Like many things Johnson did, the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent, in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist. Though there was no church involved, according to PolitiFact, churches were covered by the bill as well. Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives, a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right. Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship. Courts have not agreed. Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year, Jerry Falwell Jr. the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter, said it would “create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech. ”",0,336,17.68421052631579,19,0.37202380952380953,0,0,0,0,95.00224618149147,1.7900326797385615,66.16666666666667,59.59428571428572,0.7916666666666666,0.02976190476190476,0.03571428571428571,0.023809523809523808,0.047619047619047616,0.017857142857142856,0.13095238095238096,0.008928571428571428,0.002976190476190476,0.002976190476190476,0.11011904761904762,0,0.07738095238095238,0.002976190476190476,0,0.011904761904761904,0.01488095238095238,0.08333333333333333,0,0.05654761904761905,0.017857142857142856,0.05357142857142857,0,0,0.02976190476190476,0.017857142857142856,0.11904761904761904,0,0,0.002976190476190476,0,0,0,0.050595238095238096,0,0,0.49404761904761907,0.002976190476190476,0.011904761904761904,0.002976190476190476,0,0.050595238095238096,0.005952380952380952,0,0.002976190476190476,0.01488095238095238,0.002976190476190476,0.02976190476190476,0.020833333333333332,0.002976190476190476,0.005952380952380952,0.01488095238095238,0.002976190476190476,0.002976190476190476,0.011904761904761904,0.19345238095238096,0.002976190476190476,0,0.017857142857142856,0.05654761904761905,0.10714285714285714,0.03571428571428571,0.03273809523809524,0.06845238095238096,0.15773809523809523,0.08630952380952381,0.020833333333333332,0.002976190476190476,0.008928571428571428,0.09523809523809523,0.02976190476190476,0.008928571428571428,0.008928571428571428,0.002976190476190476,0.002976190476190476,0,0,0.026785714285714284,0.07738095238095238,0.05952380952380952,0,0.020833333333333332,0.008928571428571428,0.03571428571428571,0.08630952380952381,0.10416666666666667,0,0.05357142857142857,0,7,0,17,1,1,0,10,2,1,7,15,4,15,0,7,0,40,10,31,81,40,,0.2642148665478112,0,0.4658352497088437,0.04879574852141934,0.04879574852141934,0,0.339056738914926,0.09305100366818048,0.04879574852141934,0.2642148665478112,0.43486342157592855,0.17025921636942778,0.43486342157592855,0,0.17025921636942778,0,0.10204081632653061,0.025510204081632654,0.07908163265306123,0.2066326530612245,0.3950131997138715,0.7933673469387755,25
122,"President Donald Trump signaled his support for   activists attending the March for Life on Friday. [“The #MarchForLife is so important,” he wrote on Twitter. “To all of you marching  —   you have my full support!”  The President confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the   event. According to organizers, Pence is speaking around noon. Trump set big expectations for the March for Life during an interview with ABC’s David Muir when asked to compare possible crowd size to that of last week’s Women’s March on Washington: “You will have a large crowd on Friday, too, which is mostly   people, too, and I didn’t realize this, but I was told. You will have a very large crowd of people —  as large or larger, Trump said. Some people said it will be larger —    people, and they say the press doesn’t cover them.",0,148,18.5,8,0.22297297297297297,0,0,0.006756756756756757,0,76.55235755235755,49.63963963963965,92.19604111153407,64.2042042042042,0.8716216216216216,0,0.060810810810810814,0.0472972972972973,0.02027027027027027,0.006756756756756757,0.22297297297297297,0,0,0.033783783783783786,0.060810810810810814,0,0.0945945945945946,0.02027027027027027,0,0,0.006756756756756757,0.060810810810810814,0.006756756756756757,0.060810810810810814,0.02702702702702703,0.0472972972972973,0,0,0.02027027027027027,0.006756756756756757,0.07432432432432433,0.006756756756756757,0,0.006756756756756757,0.006756756756756757,0,0.033783783783783786,0.0472972972972973,0,0,0.47297297297297297,0.02027027027027027,0.033783783783783786,0,0.02027027027027027,0.033783783783783786,0.006756756756756757,0,0.006756756756756757,0.013513513513513514,0.006756756756756757,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.006756756756756757,0.013513513513513514,0,0.006756756756756757,0,0,0.25675675675675674,0.033783783783783786,0,0.04054054054054054,0.0472972972972973,0.060810810810810814,0.07432432432432433,0.02027027027027027,0.06756756756756757,0.14189189189189189,0.10810810810810811,0.013513513513513514,0,0.033783783783783786,0.18243243243243243,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013513513513513514,0.16891891891891891,0.08783783783783784,0,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,0.08783783783783784,0.16891891891891891,0.16891891891891891,0,0.04054054054054054,0.02702702702702703,1,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2.73,0,1,0,3.73,2,2,7.73,3.73,,0.07326484679668878,0,0.1365270594958143,0,0,0,0.1365270594958143,0,0,0,0,0,0.17751351581930236,0,0,0,0.02491150737995058,0.013357376611233554,0.013357376611233554,0.05162626060241769,0.1620719440713719,0.9483737393975823,6
123,"A New York City police official was found dead on Friday in a car on Long Island, where he is believed to have shot himself, the authorities said. The official, Inspector Michael Ameri, the commanding officer of the Police Department’s Highway District, was found in Suffolk County with what appeared to be a   gunshot wound, Stephen P. Davis, the department’s top spokesman, said in a statement. The authorities in Suffolk County said detectives were investigating a death that was reported shortly before 1 p. m. in Babylon. Inspector Ameri, 44, was a friend of Deputy Inspector James Grant, the commander of the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, who had been reassigned as part of a wave of discipline amid a sprawling federal inquiry into municipal corruption in New York. Inspector Grant was placed on modified duty last month. There has been no indication that Inspector Ameri was under investigation. It was unclear whether investigators were seeking Inspector Ameri’s cooperation with their inquiry focused on Inspector Grant. Mr. Davis declined to comment on the investigation. “We’ve consistently said this is an ongoing investigation and we would not comment whatsoever,” he said. A law enforcement official said that as of Friday, Inspector Ameri’s duty status had not changed. On Friday evening, police cars were parked in front of Inspector Ameri’s home in West Babylon. Inspector Ameri was the commanding officer of the 78th Precinct in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, from 2011 to July 2014, when he left to lead the Highway District. “We are saddened to learn of the passing of Inspector Michael Ameri,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. ” City Hall officials said that Mr. de Blasio knew Inspector Ameri in passing from the time when the inspector was commander of the 78th Precinct. Roy T. Richter, the president of the union that represents police captains, inspectors and deputy chiefs, said the group was “heartbroken” by Inspector Ameri’s death and asked “that you keep his family in your prayers during this traumatic time. ” “Inspector Ameri is known as a dedicated police officer who excelled in all of his command assignments,” he said.",0,375,17.857142857142858,21,0.3466666666666667,0,0,0,0,96.09304029304029,34.85596707818931,85.09090909090908,17.957264957264957,0.7973333333333333,0.010666666666666666,0.02666666666666667,0.013333333333333334,0.010666666666666666,0.02666666666666667,0.17333333333333334,0,0,0.018666666666666668,0.08533333333333333,0,0.072,0.0026666666666666666,0,0.005333333333333333,0.0026666666666666666,0.05333333333333334,0,0.06133333333333333,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0,0.008,0.008,0.0026666666666666666,0.14666666666666667,0,0.005333333333333333,0,0,0,0.008,0.10666666666666667,0.0026666666666666666,0.0026666666666666666,0.4106666666666667,0.0026666666666666666,0.029333333333333333,0.008,0,0.034666666666666665,0,0,0.029333333333333333,0.018666666666666668,0.005333333333333333,0.02666666666666667,0.016,0.016,0.008,0.008,0,0,0.018666666666666668,0.21066666666666667,0,0,0.032,0.06133333333333333,0.08,0.04,0.0026666666666666666,0.11733333333333333,0.14666666666666667,0.07466666666666667,0.008,0,0.032,0.17333333333333334,0.005333333333333333,0,0.0026666666666666666,0.0026666666666666666,0.0026666666666666666,0,0,0.021333333333333333,0.104,0.112,0,0.005333333333333333,0.0026666666666666666,0.04533333333333334,0.14133333333333334,0.13866666666666666,0.010666666666666666,0.056,0.005333333333333333,13,0,14,0,0,4,8,2,0,26,12,2,8,2,13,0,35,12,50,94,35,,0.38813035822689074,0,0.40586884574494986,0,0,0.16330595576157622,0.28076183217795947,0.0889129881342269,0,0.5592131256644566,0.3693000666051825,0.0889129881342269,0.28076183217795947,0.0889129881342269,0.6612236768840951,0,0.07882882882882883,0.02702702702702703,0.11261261261261261,0.21171171171171171,-0.5086232538105614,0.7882882882882882,25

125,"Nevada: Rep. Election Workers Intimidated November 08, 2016 Myla Gibson, 3, waits as her father Ken Gibson fills out a ballot for the presidential election at the James Weldon Johnson school in East Harlem, Republican volunteers called 911 claiming Clinton supporters were Harassing them. Volunteers canvassing and dropping off literature at houses Monday for Nevada Republican senate candidate Rep. Joe Heck were followed by supporters of Hillary Clinton, who then subsequently pulled down the literature, a source within the Nevada Republican Party told The Daily Caller in an exclusive report. The staffers following them were wearing HRC buttons and HRC stickers. Beyond following them, the HRC workers began going up to houses and illegally removing Heck literature from the doors,” the Nevada GOP source said. “When the Heck volunteers noticed this going on, they stopped to take pictures of the illegal action.” The source said that, “Within a few minutes, more HRC campaign workers showed up. At this point, the Heck volunteers began to feel threatened and called 911 to report HRC workers illegally removing campaign literature and harassing the Heck volunteers.” Reports like the case in Nevada may seem minor to some, but those that have been called to pray over this election know that it only confirms the need for prayer. The kind of anger and even violence that can manifest during and after elections is something to be taken seriously. We have seen violence erupt during elections in other countries, and it certainly isn't something we want to see in the United States. The call is to pray without ceasing Church!

126,"79   GOLD , KWN King World News On the heels of continued chaos in key markets, radical changes are in store for the world and global markets. Radical Changes Are Coming On the heels of the release of his KWN audio interview covering the gold smash and urging investors to remain strong, KWN did a follow-up interview with Dr. Leeb because of the intensity of the recent takedown in gold, silver, and the mining shares: “If you’re worried that gold’s post-election drop means the bull market in the metal that we’ve been predicting is a mirage, relax. The current dip in gold, while it could last a month or two longer, is merely a slight head fake in a bull market more on course than ever to be of momentous proportions… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. If we had to sum it up in a single (albeit long) sentence, here it is: Trump’s victory and the market’s subsequent turbulence signals a seismic shift in market leadership to commodity-led growth; U.S. imports of increasingly scarce and ever more costly commodities will rise drastically and so will inflation that a behind-the-curve Fed will be helpless to curb; the eventual, inevitable upshot will be that commodity producers will become increasingly reluctant to take paper money for their ever scarcer resources and will want some more durable asset like, you guessed it, gold. That’s the case for gold in broad outline. Now for the supporting evidence. Let’s start with the reality that the U.S. has been blindly complacent about commodities, which will be required in massive amounts for the big infrastructure push Trump has promised. The U.S. Geological Survey tracks around 65 vital commodities and minerals. For over 40 of them we import more than half our needs; for 25 (about 40 percent), we import at least 90 percent of our needs. We used to be far less dependent on other nations. At the beginning of this century we imported 90 percent or more of our needs for only a quarter of important commodities and imported 50 percent or more for about half. If you wonder why that’s a big deal, the problem is that those resources will be increasingly difficult and costly to obtain as they become scarcer. And scarcities are inevitable – in fact, they’ve begun. The chart of the index of raw industrials, the prices businesses pay in real time for the commodities they use (as opposed to futures trading) is revealing. Remarkably, it shows that even at the nadir of the Great Recession, when capitalism’s very existence seemed precarious, the index stood 20 percent higher than its average during the 1990s. There is no way to explain this other than by realizing that commodities had become scarcer than in the previous decade. Since the 2008 crash, global growth has been strong only in 2010 and the first half of 2011. In this period, the index far surpassed its 2008 high. After 2011, world growth retreated to recessionary levels until mid-2016, when just a hint of growth sent commodities almost to their pre-Great Recession peak. Now with commodity-intensive infrastructure a worldwide imperative, they are destined to go well past their all-time highs. But What About Gold? So why hasn’t gold gotten the message yet? One reason is that with gold rightfully seen more as a currency than a commodity, and with inflation still low, the market has some illusions that perhaps we’re going back to the 1990s Goldilocks era of strong growth and low inflation. But the emergence of commodity scarcities will nix that possibility. The only reason the markets haven’t already caught on is one recalcitrant commodity: oil. With oil prices lagging, headline inflation has remained low and the Fed still behaves as if it will remain low forever. But once oil gets into the act, headline inflation will jump and everything that requires oil – including virtually every other commodity – will jump as well. Here is a look at a few key reasons why oil will rise. Right now, with virtually every producer producing at full throttle, oil is about 750,000 barrels a day in oversupply. That will change either because OPEC at its meeting later this month acts to cut production or because increased demand overtakes the world’s ability to produce. Above is a sign from the 1970s warning consumers about gas shortages OPEC Will Move To Raise Oil Prices We think OPEC will act, and it won’t have to cut by much to reverse the current situation of oversupply. OPEC currently produces about 34 million barrels a day, a record amount, and is estimated to have no more than about 1 million barrels of excess supply – and even that could be overstating it. Over the past five years the cartel’s production has averaged about 31 million barrels a day. At its peak in 2015 it was producing less than 33 million barrels. Even returning to that previous peak would easily turn a glut into a deficit. And with the IEA estimating demand in 2017 will grow by 1.2 million barrels a day – likely an underestimate in light of the push for infrastructure – it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that we’re headed for an oil deficit. That means big-time gains in oil prices and in inflation. If you think fracking will fill the gap, it won’t. Even with three-digit oil, frackers will find it tough to add even half a million barrels of oil to current production. Remember, fracking is resource-intensive, so its costs rise when commodity prices go up – and much of the recent gains in fracking productivity come from vast increases in the amount of sand and water used to frack the wells. Gold Liftoff! Once oil joins the party, all the commodity pieces will be in place for gold to take off. Remember, gold was far stronger than industrial commodities during the 2001 to 2008 boom and again during the second commodity upleg between 2009 and 2011. As for the Fed, we don’t expect it to take a strong stand against inflation, not with a Trump administration that has little fear of debt and that will likely view even high inflation as better for business than slow or even negative growth. Protracted slow growth has fractured America and the world, and the 1970’s high inflation harmed Wall Street. Not much of a choice for a populist administration. Bottom line: the world has taken another giant leap to a future with little place for paper currencies and in which gold will become the monetary center. So stop worrying about gold’s current weakness and buy gold, which will be by far your best protection in a tumultuous future. While commodities and commodity-levered stocks will lead the market for the foreseeable future, gold (and other precious metals) will end up winning the race…As mentioned in the opener, KWN also released a completely separate audio interview today with Dr. Leeb covering the takedown in the gold and silver markets.

127,"They met at 18, the worst dancers in a college ballet class, and sought refuge in a basement practice room, taking a first stab at songwriting with a tune about adolescents playing hooky and footsie at a suburban diner. They went viral before going viral was a thing  —   their undergraduate years coincided with the birth of Facebook, and the first song cycle Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote, called “Edges,” was discovered, shared and performed by musical theater majors around the country. Now, at the age of 31, after a decade of being touted as promising,    and    Pasek and Paul have arrived. Their first original musical, “Dear Evan Hansen,” a daringly   show that explores the charged interplay between collective grief and social media after a misconstrued high school suicide, begins previews Monday, Nov. 14 and is generating prize chatter even before it opens on Broadway Dec. 4. Five days later, their first   Hollywood movie, “La La Land,” a romantic Ryan   Stone musical fantasia for which they wrote the lyrics, opens that film was the hit of this year’s festival circuit. But that’s not all. In an era in which the film and television industries are showing a renewed interest in musicals, they have written all the songs for a movie starring Hugh Jackman  —   a P. T. Barnum biopic called “The Greatest Showman”  —   which is now in rehearsal and scheduled for release late next year by 20th Century Fox. Disney has hired them to write new songs for a   remake of “Snow White. ” Oh, and they even have a song in “Trolls,” the DreamWorks Animation comedy that opened early this month. “I love them,” said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, who hired the pair to write three songs for the television show “Smash,” and became so enamored that he is now a   on “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “To me, they’re the future of the musical, on stage or screen. ” Musical theater history is peopled by   pairings. And even before they graduated from the University of Michigan, Pasek and Paul  —   that’s the branding they fell into as    their surnames in alphabetical order  —   have been prospectively placed in the pantheon. “Rodgers  Hart. Lerner  Loewe. Pasek  Paul? It has a nice ring to it,” said a university publication in 2006. They are handsome and charming,   and exuberant, observant, obsessive, and, of course, neurotic. Mr. Pasek writes words, and Mr. Paul writes music, but they have opted, right from the beginning, to share credit for both elements of their songs. They estimate that they spend 350 days a year together, for six to 12 hours at a stretch, sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room, and even sometimes when they are. “Everything that we’ve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this,” Mr. Paul said during a joint interview at Sardi’s, surrounded by caricatures of the industry’s greatest talents. “Our goal was always, if we could just write songs and tell stories, and get to do that every day, that’s our dream. ” [A Pasek and Paul primer: six videos to watch] Although their sensibility is contemporary, they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition, and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop  —   they are not part of the   revolution on Broadway. They have proven especially deft at musicalizing emotional yearning: The 11 o’clock number in “Dear Evan Hansen” is a poignant effort by an apologetic single mother (Rachel Bay Jones) to comfort her disconsolate son (Ben Platt). In “La La Land,” the climactic song is a stirring recollection by an aspiring actress (Ms. Stone) reflecting on inspiration at a casting call. “I think we’re attracted to material that’s hopeful and messy, and in that mess, there’s an attempt at getting at truth,” Mr. Pasek said. They are, on the surface, quite different from each other. Mr. Paul, who lives in Harlem, is a churchgoing Christian from Westport, Conn. straight married and the father of a    daughter. Mr. Pasek, who grew up in Ardmore, Pa. and now lives on the Upper West Side, is gay, Jewish and single. But they both began as little boys who loved to sing. Mr. Paul, a talented pianist, started early. At age 3, he was singing gospel music with his father, a pastor, in church. Later, he sang and danced at senior centers with Music Theater of Connecticut and then, at Staples High School, he performed in “Into the Woods,” conducted the orchestra in “Hello, Dolly!” and spent his free time poring over Broadway “fake books,” which help pianists master melodies. Mr. Pasek also sang with a parent: His mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song. (“She’s like a   musical theater character, in the best possible way,” he said.) She wrote and performed songs from a child’s point of view (“They were a big hit on the synagogue circuit,” he said) and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7. Mr. Pasek sang and traveled with the Philadelphia Boys Choir  Chorale, and then, as a student at Friends Central School, performed in musicals including “Bye Bye Birdie” and “42nd Street. ” They compare themselves to brothers, who bicker and bond, knowing their relationship will endure. A recent fight, over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in “Dear Evan Hansen,” sent Mr. Pasek stalking out of their Columbus Circle studio into the street, but then, 10 minutes later, calling Mr. Paul for a lengthy   that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul met the summer before college, at a freshman orientation weekend, and connected over a shared sense of humor, a passion for the work of Jason Robert Brown and an obsession with “Merrily We Roll Along. ” (The title “Edges” alludes to a “Merrily” lyric.) Mr. Pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior, and he recruited Mr. Paul as an arranger and accompanist with that, their collaboration began. They mined their own experiences, and those of their friends, for material, acting out songs as they wrote. “I kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it,” said Nick Blaemire, a fellow Michigan student who is now an actor in New York, recalling a night when he told Mr. Pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend, and seeing that become “I Hmm You. ” Raised in the digital age, and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity, they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work  —   at first with CDs and a homespun tour of “Edges,” and more recently with producers, performers and journalists  —   that has served them well. “They’re salesmen, and always have been  —   they know how to explain what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” Mr. Blaemire said. Michael Gracey, the director of “The Greatest Showman,” had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film, but, as he talked with Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul about the movie, abandoned that plan to give them all the work. He even videotaped their songwriting sessions, convinced that they would be of significance for posterity. “I can’t even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film,” he said. The director of “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle, had a similar experience: He was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by Justin Hurwitz when Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, seeking the gig, gave him proposed lyrics for a song called “City of Stars. ” That became a signature number. “It was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys, and we brought them on right away,” Mr. Chazelle said. Their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together. Brent Wagner, the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the University of Michigan, still remembers the night in 2005 when Mr. Blaemire, then a junior, persuaded him to stop by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to see “Edges. ” “It was a youthful work, and it wasn’t completely advanced  —   there wasn’t even music written down  —   but it was marvelous, and at that moment, you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft,” Mr. Wagner said. “By the time they left school,” he said, “we knew it would just be a matter of time. ” Jeff Marx, the Tony     of “Avenue Q,” was equally convinced  —   so sure that he placed a bet on them. A Michigan alumnus, he had taken on Mr. Pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005. (“I looked at his Friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid. ”) The next year, when Mr. Pasek asked to return, Mr. Marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul couldn’t afford to write full time  —   he needed to earn money for school  —   but Mr. Marx was so intent that he offered to give Mr. Paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job. Then, when Mr. Paul said he was unwilling to accept charity, Mr. Marx repositioned his offer as a wager, staking him $7, 000, to be repaid only if Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul made it to Broadway within the next decade. It happened, but in an unexpected way. They had a frustrating experience adapting the Roald Dahl children’s book “James and the Giant Peach,” which was mounted at Goodspeed Musicals in 2010, and has been revised since. They remain proud of their songs, and the show is still being produced at small theaters, but the Dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation. Their musical version of the 1991 film “Dogfight” was presented at Second Stage, Off Broadway, in 2012, and was generally admired, but not well enough to make the leap to Broadway. But after the initial songwriter for the adaptation of the 1983 family film “A Christmas Story” was let go, they were brought in  —   and nominated for a Tony Award  —   when the show, which was developed to tour, ended up transferring to Broadway in 2012. Six years after Mr. Marx’s bet, Mr. Paul handed him a check at the opening night party. “My money was safe,” Mr. Marx said. Other mentors have stepped in, too. Stephen Schwartz, the writer of “Pippin” and “Wicked,” has been advising them since Mr. Paul met him as an undergraduate. Mr. Schwartz recommended them to Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (“Ragtime”) who admitted them to a Dramatists Guild fellowship. Ms. Ahrens and Mr. Flaherty assigned them to observe the development of “Next to Normal,” where they met the director Michael Greif (best known for “Rent”) who is now directing “Dear Evan Hansen. ” The new show was borne from an observation Mr. Pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly he noted the desire of many, including himself, to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer, Stacey Mindich, who had helped commission “Dogfight,” offered to finance their dream project. She introduced them to the work of a playwright, Steven Levenson, who became the “Dear Evan Hansen” book writer, turning their musings into a narrative. The show, developed through   productions last year at Arena Stage in Washington and this year Off Broadway at Second Stage, features a   performance by the    Mr. Platt (“Pitch Perfect”). As a high school student he had discovered Pasek and Paul via YouTube, and sang one of the “Edges” songs at a senior concert. (Mr. Platt is not the only Pasek and Paul fan in his family  —   his father, Marc Platt, is the producer of “La La Land” and “Snow White. ”) The duo’s work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers, but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents. “The insight they seem to have into the heart of a   mother has been there as long as I’ve known them,” said Ms. Jones, who has played Pasek and Paul mothers in “A Christmas Story” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “They use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words  —   a lyric about a Ninja Turtle   or glow stars on the ceiling,” she said, referring to a song that was used during the early stages of “Dear Evan Hansen. ” Both Ms. Jones and Mr. Platt distinctly remember the day Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul brought in a new song, “So   Small,” in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his character’s childhood. “It makes you die inside because it’s so real,” she said. Mr. Platt agreed. “Everybody was a big wreck. ” As they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie, Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence. They have been working on “Dear Evan Hansen” for six years, they finished writing songs for “Trolls” and “La La Land” more than a year ago, and they haven’t yet begun work on “Snow White. ” But still  —   on one particularly busy recent day, they started in Dumbo, Brooklyn, at 8:30 a. m. for a “Greatest Showman” script meeting traveled to Midtown to tweak “Dear Evan Hansen” arrangements with their orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire split up so Mr. Paul could go to a Chelsea studio to record tracks for “Showman” while Mr. Pasek sat in on auditions for Mr. Platt’s understudy went to MoMA for a screening of “La La Land” hosted by Jennifer Lawrence and then to an   at the Rainbow Room’s Bar SixtyFive. Most days aren’t nearly that varied or that glamorous. And at the start of each project, it is still the two of them, trying to figure out how to tell a story through music. “Nothing changes  —   the next time we have to write a song we’re going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be,” Mr. Paul said. Mr. Pasek jumped in, finishing the thought: “Facing the blank page doesn’t get any easier. ”",0,2456,23.844660194174757,103,0.2683224755700326,0,0,0,0,91.24732433690089,23.234231566479117,89.2701214095351,66.60679385760818,0.8253257328990228,0.011807817589576547,0.04275244299674267,0.028501628664495113,0.037866449511400654,0.02728013029315961,0.23412052117263843,0.0016286644951140066,0.0012214983713355048,0.013436482084690555,0.08631921824104234,0,0.05456026058631922,0.006514657980456026,0.0012214983713355048,0.01017915309446254,0.008550488599348535,0.06351791530944625,0.0024429967426710096,0.07614006514657981,0.02239413680781759,0.06473941368078176,0,0.002035830618892508,0.015879478827361564,0.006514657980456026,0.09527687296416938,0.00040716612377850165,0.006921824104234527,0.00040716612377850165,0.007328990228013029,0,0.006514657980456026,0.06229641693811075,0.006514657980456026,0.006514657980456026,0.4584690553745928,0.0016286644951140066,0.03257328990228013,0.004071661237785016,0.004071661237785016,0.033794788273615636,0.002035830618892508,0.0012214983713355048,0.018322475570032574,0.015879478827361564,0.048452768729641695,0.04478827361563518,0.005700325732899023,0.010993485342019544,0.0061074918566775245,0.008143322475570033,0.00040716612377850165,0.002035830618892508,0.01750814332247557,0.20643322475570033,0.009364820846905538,0.004478827361563518,0.048452768729641695,0.06555374592833876,0.10830618892508144,0.06392508143322476,0.029723127035830618,0.0500814332247557,0.1461726384364821,0.0981270358306189,0.008550488599348535,0.00040716612377850165,0.06188925081433225,0.15553745928338764,0.003257328990228013,0.008550488599348535,0.0028501628664495114,0.0016286644951140066,0.011807817589576547,0,0.0008143322475570033,0.021172638436482084,0.14332247557003258,0.08102605863192182,0,0.008957654723127036,0.03175895765472313,0.06351791530944625,0.1262214983713355,0.12337133550488599,0.005293159609120521,0.0492671009771987,0.0016286644951140066,127,11,53.4,1,21.175,23,45.5,30,18.73,34,21,39,116.6,0,127,7,334.505,89.5,164.6,572.605,334.505,,0.7367135329662101,0.19507965528006682,0.5405557363363201,0.021557660452472496,0.3181233902124038,0.3363201345837623,0.5006204234478504,0.3979454190941605,0.29212119865978015,0.42828050623428054,0.31632592977421764,0.4621552727161297,0.7198098586602363,0,0.6686755018446546,0.13362036802659677,0.11620385568704285,0.031091448809405946,0.05718047457014769,0.1989175312347474,0.8411196364978962,0.8010824687652526,150
128,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Tuesday nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal, partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation’s highest court. Mr. Trump announced his selection during a   evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House. He described Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge based in Denver, as “a man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. ” “Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support,” Mr. Trump said, standing beside the judge and his wife, Louise, as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on. “It is an extraordinary résumé  —   as good as it gets. ” But Democrats  —   embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama’s choice to succeed Justice Scalia, and inflamed by Mr. Trump’s aggressive moves at the start of his tenure  —   promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump’s eventual nominee, leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president, and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution. Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch, calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled. The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump’s presidency. Just a day earlier, he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his   immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims. “Now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights and will stand up to a president who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Mr. Schumer said. He said he would insist that Judge Gorsuch meet the   threshold needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster for his confirmation to move forward. That would either require eight Democrats to join the Senate’s 52 Republicans to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to escalate a parliamentary showdown  —   as Mr. Trump has already urged them to do  —   to change longstanding rules and push through his nominee on a simple majority vote. Republicans and conservative groups signaled they relished a war over Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. “I hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an    vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four   nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He noted that the Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that immediately started a $10 million campaign to defend Mr. Trump’s nominee, said the coalition would mount intensive campaigns in crucial states to “force vulnerable senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats. ” If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by Justice Scalia, but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. As an Episcopalian, Judge Gorsuch would be the only Protestant seated among five Catholics and three Jewish jurists. He would restore the    split between conservatives and liberals on the court, returning the swing vote to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose rulings have fallen on both sides of the political spectrum. At 49, Judge Gorsuch (pronounced  ) is the youngest nominee to the Supreme Court in 25 years, underscoring his potential to shape major decisions for decades to come. In choosing him, Mr. Trump reached for a reliably conservative figure in Justice Scalia’s mold, but not someone known to be divisive. Mr. Trump, who recognized Justice Scalia’s wife, Maureen, in the audience as he announced his choice, heaped praise on the “late, great” jurist, saying his “image and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. ” Judge Gorsuch said he was humbled by his “most solemn assignment. ” “I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country,” he said. He also praised Justice Scalia as “a lion of the law. ” The announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over Mr. Obama’s nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans refused to even consider  —   much less support  —   his nomination in the thick of a presidential campaign. A Colorado native who was in the same class at Harvard Law School as Mr. Obama, Judge Gorsuch is known for his   measured opinions that are normally, though not exclusively, conservative. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Kennedy. That Judge Gorsuch has a personal connection to Justice Kennedy is no accident. By choosing a familiar figure, several officials said, the White House is sending a reassuring signal to Justice Kennedy, 80, who has been mulling retirement. Choosing a more ideologically extreme candidate, the officials said, could have tempted Justice Kennedy to hang on to his seat for several more years, depriving Mr. Trump of another seat to fill. Still, Judge Gorsuch’s conservative credentials are not in doubt. He has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who invoked religious objections for refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. And he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives,” he said on Tuesday. “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ” Judge Gorsuch is the son of Anne Gorsuch Burford, who became the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington, before going to Columbia University. There had been some speculation that Mr. Trump would choose someone with a less elite background for the court. The other finalist for the post, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and helped pay for his education by driving a taxi. The White House stoked suspense over Mr. Trump’s court choice in the hours before announcing it. A senior Trump administration official said both Judge Gorsuch and Judge Hardiman were summoned to Washington for the nomination ceremony. But only Judge Gorsuch appeared at the White House gathering shortly after 8 p. m. In an allusion to the intense foreshadowing he and his team did to encourage interest and speculation over the pick, Mr. Trump interrupted his own announcement to marvel at his showmanship: “So was that a surprise?” the president said after announcing Judge Gorsuch’s name. “Was it?” As he looked out into an audience that Democrats had refused to join  —   several senior lawmakers declined his invitation to attend the East Room ceremony  —   the president expressed hope that he could avoid a partisan battle. “I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,” Mr. Trump said. But progressive groups had already gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court to protest a nominee they predicted would be extreme. Nan Aron of the   Alliance for Justice called Judge Gorsuch “a disastrous choice,” adding that his record showed “no sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration. ” Conservatives were as ardent in their support. Tom Fitton, the president of the   group Judicial Watch, called Mr. Trump’s nomination “a major step in the right direction in defining his presidency and moving the Supreme Court away from dangerous and destructive judicial activism. ”",0,1449,23,63,0.378191856452726,0,0,0,0,97.34152771437803,3.1100794535577156,79.23207576106127,35.40934999872198,0.7605244996549344,0.01518288474810214,0.04485852311939269,0.020703933747412008,0.04416839199447895,0.015873015873015872,0.16149068322981366,0.008971704623878536,0.002070393374741201,0.011732229123533472,0.10213940648723258,0,0.04485852311939269,0.003450655624568668,0.0006901311249137336,0.008281573498964804,0.005521048999309869,0.07039337474120083,0.0006901311249137336,0.057971014492753624,0.022774327122153208,0.04002760524499655,0,0.0006901311249137336,0.017943409247757072,0.01725327812284334,0.14837819185645273,0,0.0027605244996549345,0.0013802622498274672,0.0027605244996549345,0,0.008971704623878536,0.037267080745341616,0,0,0.42581090407177363,0.002070393374741201,0.010351966873706004,0.004830917874396135,0.003450655624568668,0.029675638371290544,0.0013802622498274672,0.0006901311249137336,0.01725327812284334,0.00966183574879227,0.0027605244996549345,0.049689440993788817,0.0027605244996549345,0.01518288474810214,0.005521048999309869,0.018633540372670808,0.0013802622498274672,0,0.011732229123533472,0.17391304347826086,0.00759144237405107,0.0006901311249137336,0.022084195997239476,0.053830227743271224,0.05866114561766736,0.04692891649413389,0.024154589371980676,0.10835058661145618,0.147688060731539,0.07660455486542443,0.020013802622498276,0.0013802622498274672,0.027605244996549344,0.11249137336093858,0.004830917874396135,0.00966183574879227,0.008281573498964804,0.0013802622498274672,0.00966183574879227,0,0,0.035886818495514144,0.10628019323671498,0.06418219461697723,0,0.011042097998619738,0.005521048999309869,0.033126293995859216,0.09109730848861283,0.09178743961352658,0.002070393374741201,0.04623878536922015,0,75,0,93,1,15,6,28,37.75,24.505000000000003,51.7,41,21,45.525,2,75,10,192.03,50,178.925,412.28,192.03,,0.6787546615361221,0,0.7237552417147672,0.027399903652579584,0.2970504159217057,0.14459058185587106,0.4409693352116292,0.5153831374657294,0.408406601495518,0.592913851242842,0.5359723832719583,0.3717045820153255,0.5618880416803346,0.05333834187674792,0.39807378953443506,0.21979723016032496,0.11021764584337765,0.02869802787152467,0.10269589273825104,0.2366324586174438,0.34301971812308035,0.7633675413825562,119

130,"Companies have expressed numerous concerns over the proposed border walls. With the lack of funding in the 2017 budget, those concerns are growing. [Construction of President Trump’s proposed border wall along the U. S.  Border is slated to kick off in June when 20 selected bidders will be asked to build prototypes based on the proposals they submitted, Breitbart Texas previously reported.  However, The Arizona Republic reports that some bidders are starting to have serious doubts with some already giving up on the project due to how poorly the government is managing details. Michael Hari, the founder of Crisis Resolution Security Services in Illinois, submitted a proposal but is now one of its skeptics. “From the beginning it’s not a serious process, it’s not going to get the wall built,” Hari said. “Right from the   there were conflicts, there was not enough time given to it, to develop a reasonable process that would result in a wall getting built. ” Hari, a former sheriff’s deputy, described to the Chicago Tribune in April his vision and reasons for wanting to work on the border wall, which is about more than money. “We would look at the wall as not just a physical barrier to immigration but also as a symbol of the American determination to defend our culture, our language, our heritage, from any outsiders,” Hari said. M3 Federal, a consulting firm for contractors that has over 40 years of experience working on government contracts, warned that Washington not have a specific concept in mind for what exactly they seeking, as evidenced by multiple changes made to the requests for proposals. “The fact that things are being delayed and the fact that there are seven amendments out there just verifies the fact that the government does not have a confirmed concept about what they want to put in place,” said Patrick Malyszek, owner of M3 Federal. “The way the government is handling this is actually going to create a very high risk in terms of the overall project. ” Among those bidders who have already given up on the border wall project is Christopher Dillon, owner of a construction management company based in Alaska. “From the outset of the project, I have been tracking it and it’s a political stunt,” Dillon said. “It’s burning a lot of money. It’s really jerking the contracting community around. ” Building a wall on the U. S.  Border was a hallmark for Donald Trump’s campaign. During the campaign launch at Trump Tower, he said, “I would build a great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. ” Despite this promise, President Trump said that he was “very happy” with the $1. 2 trillion spending bill that he signed on May 5 which included $0 for a border wall. President Trump has reassured supporters that the wall is going to get built despite the setbacks in the 2017 budget in which he blamed Democrats for being “obstructionists. ” “Look, the Democrats are obstructionists that’s all they can do is obstruct. They have no leadership. And we have to agree, and I think both  —   both sides agree, we have to keep government going, we don’t want to shut government,” he said.

131,"United States By ORIENTAL REVIEW The outcome of the 2016 presidential election will show that the American political system – as we have known it – will apparently cease to exist. Trump is nothing like those Republican pawns who, along with the puppets of the Democratic party, have spent the last 40 years erecting the facade of American democracy. It really looks like he is ready to make good on the threat he made even prior to the Republican National Convention – to send millions of his supporters into the streets. Today Trump represents an entirely new party made up of half of the American electorate, and they are ready for action. And whatever the eventual political structure of this new model, this is what is shaping America’s present reality. Moreover, this does not seem like such a unique situation. It rather appears to be the final chapter of some ancient story, in which the convoluted plotlines finally take shape and find resolution. The circumstances are increasingly reminiscent of 1860, when Lincoln’s election so enraged the South that those states began agitating for secession. Trump is today symbolic of a very real American tradition that during the Civil War (1860-1865) ran headlong into American revolutionary liberalism for the first time. Right up until World War I traditional American conservatism wore the guise of “isolationism.” Prior to WWII it was known as “non-interventionism.” Afterward, that movement attempted to use Sen. Joseph McCarthy to battle the left-liberal stranglehold. And in the 1960s it became the primary target of the “counter-cultural revolution.” Richard Nixon Its last bastion was Richard Nixon , whose fall was the result of an unprecedented attack from the left-liberal press in 1974. And this is perhaps the example against which we should compare the present-day Trump and his current fight. And by the way, the crimes of Hillary Clinton, who has failed to protect state secrets and has repeatedly been caught lying under oath, clearly outweigh the notorious Watergate scandal that led to Nixon’s forced resignation under threat of impeachment. But the liberal American media remains silent, as if nothing has happened. By all indications it is clear that we are standing before a truly epochal moment. But before turning to the future that might await us, let’s take a quick glance at the history of conflict between revolutionary liberalism and traditional white conservatism in the US. *** Immediately after WWII, an attack on two fronts was launched by the party of “expansionism” (we’ll call it that). The Soviet Union and Communism were designated the number one enemy. Enemy number two (with less hype) was traditional American conservatism. The war against traditional “Americanism” was waged by several intellectual fringe groups simultaneously. The country’s cultural and intellectual life was under the absolute control of a group known as the “ New York Intellectuals .” Literary criticism as well as all other aspects of the nation’s literary life was in the hands of this small group of literary curators who had emerged from the milieu of a Trotskyist-communist magazine known as the Partisan Review ( PR ). No one could become a professional writer in the America of the 1950s and 1960s without being carefully screened by this sect. The foundational tenets of American political philosophy and sociology were composed by militants from the Frankfurt School , which had been established during the interwar period in Weimar Germany and which moved to the US after the National Socialists took power. Here, retraining their sights from communist to liberal, they set out to design a “theory of totalitarianism” in addition to their concept of an “authoritarian personality” – both hostile to “democracy.” Max Shachtman The “New York Intellectuals” and representatives of the Frankfurt School became friends, and Hannah Arendt , for example, was an authoritative representative of both sects. This is where future neocons (Norman Podhoretz, Eliot A. Cohen, and Irving Kristol) gained their experience. The former leader of the Trotskyist Fourth International and godfather of the neocons, Max Shachtman , held a place of honor in the “family of intellectuals.” The anthropological school of Franz Boas and Freudianism reigned over the worlds of psychology and sociology at that time. The Boasian approach in psychology argued that genetic, national, and racial differences between individuals were of no importance (thus the concepts of “national culture” and “national community” were meaningless). Psychoanalysis also became fashionable, which primarily aimed to supplant traditional church institutions and become a type of quasi-religion for the middle class. The common denominator linking all these movements was anti-fascism . Did something look fishy in this? But the problem was that the traditional values of the nation, state, and family were all labeled “fascist.” From this standpoint, any white Christian man aware of his cultural and national identity was potentially a “fascist.” Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology at California State University, analyzed in detail the seizure of America’s cultural, political, and mental landscape by these “liberal sects” in his brilliant book The Culture of Critique , writing: “The New York Intellectuals, for example, developed ties with elite universities, particularly Harvard, Columbia, the University of Chicago, and the University of California-Berkeley, while psychoanalysis and anthropology became well entrenched throughout academia. “The moral and intellectual elite established by these movements dominated intellectual discourse during a critical period after World War II and leading into the countercultural revolution of the 1960s.” It was precisely this intellectual milieu that spawned the countercultural revolution of the 1960s. Riding the wave of these sentiments, the new Immigration and Nationality Act was passed in 1965, encouraging this phenomenon and facilitating the integration of immigrants into US society. The architects of the law wanted to use the celebrated melting pot to “dilute” the “potentially fascist” descendants of European immigrants by making use of new ethno-cultural elements. The 60s revolution opened the door to the American political establishment to representatives from both wings of the expansionist “party” – the neo-liberals and the neo-conservatives. Besieged by the left-liberal press in 1974, Richard Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment. In the same year the US Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik Amendment (drafted by Richard Perle ), which emerged as a symbol of the country’s “new political agenda” – economic war against the Soviet Union using sanctions and boycotts. At that same time the “hippie generation” was joining the Democratic Party on the coattails of Senator George McGovern’s campaign . And that was when Bill Clinton’s smiling countenance first emerged on the US political horizon. And the future neo-conservatives (at that time still disciples of the Democratic hawk Henry “Scoop” Jackson) began to slowly edge in the direction of the Republicans. «If there is any doubt about the power of your ideas, just look at the number of members of the Center that have been appointed to posts in this administration -especially in the Department of Defense- to dispel that doubt». Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, September 5, 2002 In 1976, Mr. Rumsfeld and his fellow neo-conservatives resurrected the Committee on the Present Danger , an inter-party club for political hawks whose goal became the launch of an all-out propaganda war against the USSR. Former Trotskyists and followers of Max Shachtman (Kristol, Podhoretz, and Jeane Kirkpatrick) and advisers to Sen. Henry Jackson (Paul Wolfowitz, Perle, Elliott Abrams, Charles Horner, and Douglas Feith) joined Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and other “Christian” politicians with the intention of launching a “campaign to transform the world.” This is where the neocons’ “nonpartisan ideology” originated. And eventually today’s “inalterable US government” hatched from this egg. American politics began to acquire its current shape during the Reagan era. In economics this was seen in the policy of neoliberalism (politics waged in the interests of big financial capital) and in foreign policy – in a strategy consisting of “holy war against the forces of evil.” The Nixon-Kissinger tradition of foreign policy (which viewed the Soviet Union and China as a normal countries with which is essential to find common ground) was entirely abandoned. The collapse of the USSR was a sign of the onset of the final phase of the “neocon revolution.” At that point their protégé, Francis Fukuyama, announced the “end of history.” *** As the years passed, the influence of the neo-conservatives (in politics) and neoliberals (in economics) only expanded. Through all manner of committees, foundations, “think tanks,” etc., the students of Milton Friedman and Leo Strauss (from the departments of economics and political science at the University of Chicago) penetrated ever more deeply into the inner workings of the Washington power machine. The apotheosis of this expansion was the presidency of George W. Bush, during which the neocons, having seized the primary instruments of power in the White House, were able to plunge the country into the folly of a war in the Middle East. By the end of the Bush presidency this clique was the object of universal hatred throughout the US. That’s why the middle-ground, innocuous figure of Barack Obama, a Democrat, was able to move into the White House for the next eight years. The neocons stepped down from their central rostrums of power and returned to their “influential committees.” It is likely that this election was intended to facilitate the triumphant return of the neoconservative-neoliberal paradigm all wrapped up in “new packaging.” For various reasons, the decision was made to assign this role to Hillary Clinton. But it seems that at the most critical moment the flimsy packaging ripped open … What happened? Why is this clique’s triumphant return to power erupting in massive scandal this time around? Probably because we are living in an era during which much that was mysterious is suddenly becoming clear. Probably because Trump’s “silent majority” suddenly saw before them someone they had been waiting for for a long time – a man ready to defend their interests. Perhaps also it is because the middle class is choking on its growing exasperation with the “elite caste” occupying its native country. And it finally became clear to the sober-minded American patriots in law enforcement that the return to power of the people responsible for the current global chaos could be a big threat to the US and rest of the world. Because, in the end, everyone has children and no one wants a new world war. How will this new conservative revolt against the elite end? Will Trump manage to “drain the swamp of Washington, DC” as he has promised, or he will end up as the system’s next victim? Very soon we can finally get an answer to these questions.

132,"JERUSALEM  —   The Israeli government on Sunday approved about $20 million in additional financing for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, underlining its strengthened   orientation and raising the ire of political opponents and the Palestinians. The move came as the Israeli   Avigdor Lieberman was to arrive in Washington on his first visit in his new role as defense minister, during which he is expected to meet with Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. Mr. Lieberman, a settler, was appointed last month in a coalition deal that brought his ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party into the government. The new money would add to what the settlements already receive from various parts of the government’s budget. It was approved days after blistering condemnations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by two former Israeli defense ministers and military chiefs of staff. Speaking at a prestigious security conference, they accused the prime minister and his government of pushing a divisive agenda that threatened Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy and undermined its core values. In remarks before the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud Party, said the assistance plan was intended to strengthen security for the settlements, as well as to bolster small businesses and encourage tourism. Yariv Levin, the tourism minister, said in a statement that some of the money would “provide financial support for the construction of hotels in the main tourism areas in Judea and Samaria,” referring to the West Bank by its biblical name. The settlements have long been a source of friction between Israel and the United States, along with much of the rest of the world. Most countries view settlement construction as a violation of international law and an impediment to a resolution of the   conflict the Obama administration has described the settlements as “illegitimate. ” Israel considers the West Bank territory that it conquered from Jordan in the   War of 1967 to be disputed, not occupied, and says the fate of the settlements should be determined in negotiations. Under growing international pressure, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lieberman recently affirmed their commitment to the principle of “two states for two peoples,” meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but the Palestinians and others are skeptical about the Israelis’ motives. “Israel is doing everything possible to sabotage every effort to achieve a just and lasting peace,” Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement after the Israeli government approved the settlement financing. “It is time for the international community to assume its responsibilities towards this extremist government that openly supports apartheid and stands against the   solution. ” While strengthening the settlements, Israel has continued to demolish unlicensed Palestinian homes and livestock pens in the part of the West Bank known as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the territory where Israel exercises full security and civil control. The financing measure was approved after months of deadly Palestinian attacks in and around the settlements, as well as in Jerusalem and in cities around Israel. But Amir Peretz, an Israeli legislator from the   Zionist Union and a former defense minister, said of the financing measure, “They are using the name of security baselessly, because the defense establishment will not abandon the settlers even without getting the millions it is getting today. ” Mr. Peretz added that the allocation was “rubbing the salt in the wounds of those who need every shekel. ” He pointed to a   protest march led by mayors of towns far from the center of Israel as they campaign for a fairer distribution of government funds for education and welfare. Moshe Yaalon, a Likud politician and a former military chief of staff who resigned from his post as defense minister last month after it was promised to Mr. Lieberman, said at the annual Herzliya security conference near Tel Aviv last week that he intended to run for prime minister in the next elections, which are to be held by late 2019. Mr. Yaalon, who has supported settlement growth, accused the Israeli leadership of scaremongering. Citing the nuclear agreement with Iran, which Mr. Netanyahu strenuously opposed, and the capabilities of the military, he said, “I can say that today and in the foreseeable future, there is no existential threat on the State of Israel. ” Ehud Barak, another former military chief and defense minister, who, as the leader of the   Labor Party, served a short and largely unsuccessful term as prime minister, said at the conference that “a fanatic seed of extreme ideology has taken over the Likud. ” He added that Mr. Netanyahu’s priority was not security but “a slow and cunning advancement of the   solution agenda. ” Mr. Barak said that would lead to either an apartheid state or a binational state “in which the Jews will become a minority within a couple of generations. ” Likud dismissed Mr. Barak, who also gave a lengthy television interview on Friday night, as a failed politician who was seeking attention. Mr. Netanyahu rejected Mr. Yaalon’s criticism as politically motivated, saying in a statement, “You cannot express full confidence in the leadership when you are on the inside and say the absolute opposite when you are on the outside. ”",0,869,29.96551724137931,29,0.39355581127733025,0,0,0,0,98.54895816209107,20.21943059284831,73.2801304181051,42.47304594140037,0.7974683544303798,0.023014959723820484,0.05753739930955121,0.01611047180667434,0.05868814729574223,0.00805523590333717,0.13693901035673187,0.00805523590333717,0.0034522439585730723,0.005753739930955121,0.12197928653624857,0,0.04372842347525892,0.004602991944764097,0,0.01380897583429229,0.00805523590333717,0.06329113924050633,0,0.05408515535097814,0.03682393555811277,0.05983889528193326,0,0.0011507479861910242,0.01611047180667434,0.006904487917146145,0.12888377445339472,0,0,0.0011507479861910242,0,0,0.009205983889528193,0.0379746835443038,0,0,0.4476409666283084,0.0023014959723820483,0.01611047180667434,0.0011507479861910242,0.0011507479861910242,0.04142692750287687,0.0034522439585730723,0.0023014959723820483,0.019562715765247412,0.01611047180667434,0.00805523590333717,0.026467203682393557,0.01611047180667434,0.01611047180667434,0.006904487917146145,0.024165707710011506,0.0011507479861910242,0.0023014959723820483,0.011507479861910242,0.17951668584579977,0.0023014959723820483,0,0.019562715765247412,0.047180667433831994,0.09205983889528194,0.020713463751438434,0.0333716915995397,0.08515535097813579,0.16570771001150747,0.06214039125431531,0.01726121979286536,0,0.02761795166858458,0.14154200230149597,0.01726121979286536,0.010356731875719217,0.018411967779056387,0.005753739930955121,0.0011507479861910242,0,0,0.011507479861910242,0.08285385500575373,0.07364787111622555,0,0.006904487917146145,0.004602991944764097,0.05293440736478711,0.08860759493670886,0.08170310701956271,0,0.05983889528193326,0.0034522439585730723,27,0,54,1,11,0,11,12,2,20,23,15,26,6,27,0,93,11,106,204,93,,0.5285496157397049,0,0.691570113651726,0.039867338786847305,0.31354048090072006,0,0.31354048090072006,0.3325648391995759,0.07667774013050205,0.45368768417606564,0.48849707106756063,0.383796724968363,0.5191362698208399,0.19944693923806533,0.5093393568974495,0,0.09207920792079208,0.01089108910891089,0.10495049504950495,0.201980198019802,-0.4329092789838282,0.7980198019801981,63
133,"On Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” Gov. Greg Abbott ( ) said he will confront the issue of cities that refuse to comply with immigration law by signing legislation that could jail sheriffs of sanctuary cities.  Abbott said, “We have been pushing a piece of legislation in Texas that is going to pass that I will be signing into law that imposes even sterner penalties on counties. It will include things such as further defunding them. It will impose fines. And it could impose jail time for these sheriffs to enforce the laws. Oddly enough these sheriffs could wind up behind the very bars they are releasing these criminals from. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,116,14.5,8,0.3103448275862069,0,0,0,0,79.3635741652983,2.7772241047106503,75.48922413793103,13.977511244377812,0.6810344827586207,0,0.017241379310344827,0.02586206896551724,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.13793103448275862,0.008620689655172414,0,0.008620689655172414,0.04310344827586207,0,0.10344827586206896,0.008620689655172414,0,0.008620689655172414,0,0.034482758620689655,0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0,0,0,0.02586206896551724,0.07758620689655173,0,0,0,0,0,0.04310344827586207,0.02586206896551724,0,0,0.4827586206896552,0,0.017241379310344827,0,0.008620689655172414,0.10344827586206896,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0,0,0.02586206896551724,0.008620689655172414,0,0.034482758620689655,0,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0,0,0.1896551724137931,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724,0.0603448275862069,0.0603448275862069,0.04310344827586207,0,0.0603448275862069,0.15517241379310345,0.14655172413793102,0.008620689655172414,0,0.034482758620689655,0.1206896551724138,0,0,0,0,0.008620689655172414,0,0,0.008620689655172414,0.06896551724137931,0.07758620689655173,0,0,0.017241379310344827,0.008620689655172414,0.12931034482758622,0.16379310344827586,0.008620689655172414,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0,20,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,7,20,28,1,,0,0,0.6125741132772068,0,0,0.3562502205830146,0,0,0,0.3562502205830146,0,0,0.07326484679668878,0,0,0,0.007407407407407408,0.05185185185185185,0.14814814814814814,0.2074074074074074,-0.6799246751246121,0.7925925925925926,9
134,"  Donald J. Trump thanked supporters at a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, and announced that he intends to nominate James N. Mattis as defense secretary. Watch the video below. After claiming credit for saving jobs in Indiana, Mr. Trump held a rally in Cincinnati to say thank you to Ohio, which he carried and where no recount is being demanded. Mr. Trump exulted in rallies during the campaign and seems to be itching to return to the adulation of the crowds. Other states are expected to be added to the tour in the days and weeks ahead. Mr. Trump revealed at the rally that he had chosen James N. Mattis, a   retired Marine Corps general who led a division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, to serve as his secretary of defense. Read more. The decision by Gov. Jerry Brown of California to name Representative Xavier Becerra to be the state’s attorney general has set off another round of   among Democrats  —   and opened a crucial post in the Trump era. Mr. Becerra, like Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland before him and former Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois (now the mayor of Chicago) before them, had risen as far as he could in the House leadership. Mr. Becerra faced a blockade of older members of Congress, like Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny H. Hoyer, and James E. Clyburn, in the top ranks. Unlike Mr. Van Hollen, who was elected to the Senate last month, Mr. Becerra opted against running for his state’s open Senate seat, but he has found his own way to statewide office. Mr. Becerra was in line for a huge consolation prize in the House, however. The veteran Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan had just stepped aside as the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee  —   and he recommended the telegenic Californian for the post. That would have put Mr. Becerra on the front lines as Mr. Trump tries to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes, overhaul the tax code and possibly convert Medicare into a system that offers fixed sums to seniors to buy private health plans. Instead, it looks as if that role will go to Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, who may be less camera ready but is actually better versed on the intricacies of tax policy. So far Representative Keith Ellison’s drive to be the next Democratic National Committee chairman has gone swimmingly, with no strong competition in sight. But CNN went where other outlets have feared to tread, printing old writings of Mr. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, in defense of the   Nation of Islam and other contentious black activists. As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Mr. Ellison, writing under the name Keith E. Hakim in the student newspaper, said: “Whether one supports or opposes the establishment of Israel in Palestine and Israel’s present policies, Zionism, the ideological undergirding of Israel, is a debatable political philosophy. Anyone, including black people, has the right to hear and voice alternative views on the subject  —   notwithstanding our nominal citizenship. ” He continued: Mr. Ellison long ago renounced his associations with the Nation of Islam, and has had Jewish groups defend him. But the report could prove troublesome, to say the least. The   League, which has been mildly supportive, reacted strongly. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, is paying a visit to Trump Tower on Friday, and Senator Chuck E. Schumer of New York, the incoming minority leader, is having heart palpitations. To Democrats, that last line can mean two things, neither of them good. If she is in line for an administration job, her Senate seat would turn Republican. If not, she seems to be indicating she is a possible vote for the Trump agenda. And no matter what, her seat is up in 2018  —   in a state that went to Mr. Trump with 62 percent of the vote. The great chronicler of this year’s presidential vote, Dave Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, declared it official on Thursday: Jill Stein is the Ralph Nader of 2016. Her vote tallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania now exceed Mr. Trump’s margins in the three Rust Belt states that gave him the presidency. Another point: In the end, the difference between a Trump presidency and another Clinton administration came down to 79, 646 votes  —   fewer than a sellout for a Wisconsin Badgers football game. For the record, Mrs. Clinton’s overall lead in the popular vote  stands at 2, 544, 817.   Trump took phone calls Wednesday from Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. The results were instructive. According to Kazakhstan, Mr. Trump said “that under the leadership of Nursultan Nazarbayev our country over the years of Independence had achieved fantastic success that can be called a ‘miracle’. ” Through some rather circuitous paths, Mr. Trump’s real estate empire has been tied to Kazakhstan in ways a Financial Times investigation labeled “dirty. ” Mr. Nazarbayev has run Kazakhstan since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1989. Last year, he won a fifth consecutive term with 97. 7 percent of the vote. The Pakistani government released its own account of the telephone conversation between and Mr. Trump and Mr. Sharif that sounded, well, Trumpian. While not exactly confirming the content, the Trump transition team did acknowledge both calls. The White House has been trying its best not to criticize Mr. Trump, but after those two phone calls, a top administration official suggested that Mr. Trump get some expert help. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, noted that the relationship between Pakistan and the United States was “quite complicated” and got more so after the American raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. And then Mr. Earnest mentioned where Mr. Trump could get some assistance. “I’m just making the observation that there are dedicated experts, public servants at the State Department that have years of experience that they have amassed that they’re prepared to use to advise the incoming president,” Mr. Earnest said. Ten Democratic senators have sent a strongly worded letter to Mr. Trump criticizing the number of “lobbyists and others with extensive ties to the fossil fuel industry” in his transition team and among potential nominees for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior. Citing advisers like Myron Ebell of the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute and the former fossil fuel lobbyist Thomas Pyle, the senators argued that “you have raised serious questions about your desire to ‘drain the swamp’ with respect to energy and environmental issues. ” The letter, signed by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and others, quoted a 2009 advertisement signed by Mr. Trump calling climate change “scientifically irrefutable,” with “catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. ” Chalk up another tradition broken in the Trump era: the practice of cabinet picks going mum once they are named, shunning the news media until confirmed by the Senate. Steven Mnuchin, the newly named choice for Treasury secretary, made that break most evident on Wednesday, appearing on CNBC and before reporters at Trump Tower, musing at length on tax policy. Others including Wilbur L. Ross, tapped for commerce secretary, have been similarly voluble. This has surprised people in both parties familiar with the tortuous Senate confirmation process  —   and with what they see as the good reasons to stay silent. Talking to the press is “an opportunity to fail  —   it can only kind of cause you more headaches and questions,” said Dean Zerbe, a former adviser to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, on the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Mnuchin, for example, said the Trump tax plan would give a big tax cut to the middle class but not to the wealthy, though a range of nonpartisan analyses have concluded the opposite. “As soon as I saw that,” Mr. Zerbe said, “my immediate thought was, ‘O. K. you’ve just now given about a dozen questions to senators to ask about. ’” Not that the 1, 000 workers whose jobs were saved will care, but the deal to keep that Carrier plant in the United States, which included a multiyear, $7 million incentive package from Indiana, is starting to take flack from the right and the left. To conservatives, government intervention at such a microlevel is just bad economics. The   Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, weighed in early: Now it’s coming from more intellectual circles. “This is all terrible for a nation’s economic vitality if businesses make decisions to please politicians rather than customers and shareholders. Yet America’s private sector has just been sent a strong signal that playing ball with Trump might be part of what it now means to run an American company,” wrote James Pethokoukis, the DeWitt Wallace Fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Liberals have latched onto the tax breaks and incentives offered to Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies, by Gov. Pence of Indiana just before he leaves for Washington. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, put it this way in The Washington Post: If companies can extract tax concessions by threatening to move to Mexico, they may have found a partner willing to play ball with the new president, the critics say. Economists call that “moral hazard. ”",0,1573,20.166666666666668,78,0.343928798474253,0,0,0,0,96.90602684029257,11.096634717264086,72.69805043441407,53.243483788938335,0.7520661157024794,0.020343293070565798,0.04767959313413859,0.020343293070565798,0.03814367450731087,0.01144310235219326,0.17800381436745072,0.003178639542275906,0.0012714558169103624,0.012078830260648443,0.08773045136681501,0.0006357279084551812,0.052765416401780035,0.00572155117609663,0.0012714558169103624,0.01144310235219326,0.003178639542275906,0.06738715829624921,0.004450095359186269,0.06802288620470438,0.02733630006357279,0.04450095359186268,0,0.0006357279084551812,0.02542911633820725,0.009535918626827717,0.10553083280356007,0,0.0012714558169103624,0.0025429116338207248,0.0050858232676414495,0,0.009535918626827717,0.03496503496503497,0.0012714558169103624,0.0012714558169103624,0.4132231404958678,0.003814367450731087,0.01080737444373808,0.0025429116338207248,0.0019071837253655435,0.03877940241576605,0.0019071837253655435,0.0012714558169103624,0.013350286077558804,0.008900190718372537,0.008900190718372537,0.029879211697393517,0.01652892561983471,0.018436109345200253,0.00572155117609663,0.01144310235219326,0.0012714558169103624,0.0006357279084551812,0.01652892561983471,0.182453909726637,0.0050858232676414495,0.0006357279084551812,0.02288620470438652,0.06802288620470438,0.08328035600762873,0.02542911633820725,0.026064844246662427,0.06929434202161475,0.1519389701207883,0.06420851875397329,0.014621741894469168,0,0.019707565162110616,0.12015257469802924,0.004450095359186269,0.012714558169103624,0.006993006993006993,0.0006357279084551812,0.009535918626827717,0,0,0.014621741894469168,0.08836617927527018,0.06166560712015257,0,0.017164653528289893,0.003814367450731087,0.03877940241576605,0.10298792116973936,0.09853782581055308,0.0019071837253655435,0.06357279084551812,0.003178639542275906,59.075,0,43,4,9,0,21,22.8,10.58,30.75,20.125,12.75,34,0,59.075,10,148.07999999999998,34,100.55,280.88,148.07999999999998,,0.5993091212156161,0,0.5212321155733255,0.09196071325456735,0.18557911957158013,0,0.34712559574756296,0.3659896989028576,0.21127533186115757,0.43774213972143167,0.33754412109669696,0.24403391942920757,0.46260495235876714,0,0.3969657445959705,0.2020331186045411,0.08361944344054932,0.019199494036863027,0.05677968015901698,0.15861040838453197,0.6298828169459734,0.841389591615468,83
135,"WASHINGTON  —   The sudden death of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act has created an opening for voices from both parties to press for fixes to the acknowledged problems in President Barack Obama’s signature health law, as lawmakers and some senior White House officials appealed for bipartisanship. But the White House, still smarting from a disastrous defeat on Friday, appeared uncertain on the path forward. President Trump predicted that “Obamacare will explode” and offered no plan to stop it, but his was not the only voice from the White House. The president “wants to make sure that people don’t get left behind” in the search for affordable, quality health care, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on “Fox News Sunday. ” “I think it’s time for our folks to come together,” Mr. Priebus said, adding that it is time to “potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board, as well” as they try to bring down premiums and stabilize insurance markets. That appeal was echoed by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who opposed the House Republicans’ health bill and has also worked with Democrats to explore changes to the Affordable Care Act without repealing it. “With the demise of the House bill, there’s a real window of opportunity for a bipartisan approach to health care,” she said. In the wake of the Republican failure to make good on the    promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders find themselves at a political crossroads. They could sabotage the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets, betting that Democrats would be blamed for collapsing coverage choices and spikes in insurance premiums and would then come to the negotiating table ready to toss the law and start fresh. Or they could work with Democratic lawmakers and moderate Republicans, who for years have discussed improvements to the Affordable Care Act, which, unlike many social welfare programs, has not been significantly updated or revised. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said he wants to move on to other issues, and indicated that Democrats would have to come to him if they want to cooperate on health care. After insisting that the health law had to be eradicated “root and branch,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has been remarkably quiet since Friday’s debacle. The messages from the White House, so far, have been mixed. “You cannot fix a broken system,” the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “You are never going to fix that. This system must be removed. ” Mr. Trump appeared to endorse the    strategy on Saturday morning, saying on Twitter: “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!” But Mr. Priebus’s softer vision gave some in Congress hope that a bipartisan approach could be found  —   possibly to alleviate the health law’s burdens on small business, repeal some of its more unpopular taxes, give employers more leeway on which employees they have to offer insurance to, and foster more competition among insurance companies. “I believe that there is a group of centrist Democrats who recognize that the Affordable Care Act has flaws that must be fixed,” Ms. Collins said. “Until there was a repudiation of the House bill, they felt constrained from negotiating. Now that the House bill has died, I hope they will feel free to come to the table. ” Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, also called for bipartisanship. His state has benefited from its expansion of Medicaid under the health law, and would have been punished under the House Republican bill because its high premium costs would not have been offset by larger tax credits, as they are under current law. “The reason why Obamacare failed was because it wasn’t a bipartisan bill,” Mr. Young said. Republicans, he said, made the same mistake, writing their bill without Democrats. “We were very frankly guilty of that,” he said. Democrats also sounded more conciliatory. “Until now, we haven’t talked at all about compromise on the Affordable Care Act,” said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. “From the moment it passed, Republicans started their mantra of ‘repeal and replace.’ Now that repeal seems to be off the table, I think it’s in everybody’s interest to make the law work better for our constituents. ” Representative Jim Cooper, a centrist Democrat from Tennessee who has often worked with Republicans, said: “We need to fix the flaws in Obamacare. I hope Republicans are willing to do that, instead of just destroying Obamacare. ” But, he added, “before we can work with them, the Republicans have to bargain in good faith and stop sabotaging Obamacare. ” Mr. Obama’s health care law may not be imploding, as President Trump says. But in states as diverse as Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, the public insurance marketplaces  —   a central innovation of the Affordable Care Act  —   are in trouble. Consumers have seen big premium increases for health plans sold by a shrinking number of insurers. “People will have to come to the bargaining table sooner rather than later,” said Chris Jacobs, a health policy analyst. Within a few weeks, insurers must decide whether they will participate in the marketplaces in 2018. Insurance markets could quickly unravel if the House wins a court case challenging the legality of subsidies paid by the government to insurers on behalf of   people. “The comments by President Trump and Speaker Ryan predicting the collapse of the A. C. A. and health insurance exchanges could become a   prophecy,” said Kevin J. Counihan, who was the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, HealthCare. gov, under Mr. Obama. Mr. Counihan said he saw a risk that some counties might not have any insurers on the exchange next year as major insurers like Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth pull back from the program. Republicans in Congress, especially those from rural areas, share that concern. The Obama administration worked hard to keep insurers in the market, and to promote   during open enrollment season. Whether the Trump administration will do so is unclear. Mr. Counihan suggested several areas where Republicans and Democrats in Congress could work together. They could, he said, give insurers more discretion to charge higher premiums for older adults, reflecting their medical costs. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can charge older adults no more than three times the rates for young adults. The House Republican bill would have allowed them to charge five times as much, or more if states wanted. A ceiling somewhere between those numbers might be appropriate, Mr. Counihan said. In addition, he said, Congress could shorten the length of “grace periods” during which insurers must provide coverage to consumers who fail to pay their premiums. Lawmakers from both parties have also expressed a desire to give states more freedom to pursue their own ideas for expanding coverage, controlling health costs, reducing premiums and stabilizing insurance markets. Giving states more flexibility is consistent with Republicans’ federalism philosophy. It also has potential appeal to Democrats because many states, including some with Republican governors, are to the left of the Trump administration on health policy. One section of the Affordable Care Act, added at the behest of Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, already allows waivers for innovations in state health policy. But states say the requirements are so stringent that the waivers are of limited use. “As Republicans, we know that     works for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets,” said Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health. Lawmakers of both parties also support legislation to help small businesses get insurance. As a possible model for bipartisan cooperation, they point to a bill signed by Mr. Obama in 2015 that changed the definition of “small employer” to protect such companies against increases in health insurance premiums. The possibility of bipartisan cooperation may not last long. Some conservative Republicans like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Sean P. Duffy of Wisconsin said they would redouble their efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act. “Rip it all out by the roots!” Representative Steve King of Iowa said Friday in a Twitter post. But other Republicans said that Democrats should be involved in efforts to rewrite the law. Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, opposed the House bill and said its demise could “prove to be a catalyst” for forging a consensus. “Seeming stopping points can ultimately prove to be beginning points in life,” he said.",0,1444,19.513513513513512,74,0.3462603878116344,0,0,0,0,93.69689380012322,7.429271845291511,72.64976915974147,68.88068856351406,0.7998614958448753,0.022853185595567867,0.05193905817174515,0.022853185595567867,0.0443213296398892,0.018698060941828253,0.1786703601108033,0.002077562326869806,0.002770083102493075,0.011772853185595568,0.07686980609418283,0,0.07132963988919667,0.01592797783933518,0.0006925207756232687,0.013157894736842105,0.0110803324099723,0.0997229916897507,0.0013850415512465374,0.06509695290858726,0.024238227146814405,0.04778393351800554,0,0.002770083102493075,0.024930747922437674,0.025623268698060944,0.1128808864265928,0.0013850415512465374,0.0006925207756232687,0.004847645429362881,0.0013850415512465374,0,0.018005540166204988,0.04362880886426593,0,0,0.42728531855955676,0.014542936288088643,0.022853185595567867,0.01038781163434903,0.0034626038781163434,0.03462603878116344,0.002077562326869806,0.0006925207756232687,0.01592797783933518,0.009002770083102494,0.004155124653739612,0.01592797783933518,0.04362880886426593,0.014542936288088643,0.012465373961218837,0.01038781163434903,0.0013850415512465374,0.0006925207756232687,0.004155124653739612,0.2299168975069252,0.002770083102493075,0,0.036011080332409975,0.05817174515235457,0.1128808864265928,0.0332409972299169,0.0332409972299169,0.061634349030470915,0.15096952908587258,0.0685595567867036,0.024238227146814405,0,0.038088642659279776,0.1128808864265928,0.0013850415512465374,0.013157894736842105,0.007617728531855956,0.002077562326869806,0.008310249307479225,0,0,0.008310249307479225,0.09418282548476455,0.06371191135734072,0,0.024238227146814405,0.014542936288088643,0.036703601108033244,0.14681440443213298,0.14681440443213298,0.00554016620498615,0.062326869806094184,0.0013850415512465374,44.2,0,60,3,5,12,46.075,13.875,23.25,66.175,55.5,16,127,0,44.2,6,245.95,72.075,155.03,467.355,245.95,,0.5346508929741008,0,0.6093178833016221,0.0723401117403318,0.11501982172969998,0.23776139032942536,0.5449710969895241,0.2650644072564996,0.37669654326947516,0.6323714870342544,0.5906091980343576,0.29373553102408745,0.7675071641979302,0,0.5746772645326546,0.13492008915516354,0.13837978344224985,0.04055183123236495,0.0872251182234275,0.2629497202303423,0.7697065380936675,0.7370502797696576,134
136,"Taking advantage of almost a decade of political victories in state legislatures across the country, conservative advocacy groups are quietly marshaling support for an event unprecedented in the nation’s history: a convention of the 50 states, summoned to consider amending the Constitution. The groups are an amalgam of     and   proponents, often funded by corporations and deeply conservative supporters like the billionaire Koch brothers  and Donors Trust, whose contributors are mostly anonymous. They want an amendment to require a balanced federal budget, an idea many conservatives have embraced, many economists disdain and Congress has failed to endorse for decades. But as the groups near their goal, critics and some skeptical constitutional scholars are warning that holding an   meeting with no historical parallel and no written rules could open a Pandora’s box of constitutional mischief. The process, which is playing out largely beyond public notice, rests on a clause in Article 5 of the Constitution that allows the states to sidestep Congress and draft their own constitutional amendments whenever   of their legislatures demand it. That will by no means be easy. Even if the   threshold were reached, a convention would probably face a court battle over whether the legislatures’ calls for a convention were sufficiently similar. And as with any amendment that Congress proposes,   amendments would need approval by   of the states  —   either by their legislatures or by state conventions  —   to take effect. But as Republicans have surged to control of state legislatures and moved sharply rightward during the Obama years, what was once a pet project of the party’s fringe has become a proposal with a plausible chance of success. Some of the former Republican presidential candidates, including comparative moderates like John Kasich and Jeb Bush, have endorsed a state amendment convention. So far, 28 states have adopted resolutions calling for a convention on a   amendment, including 10 in the past three years, and two, Oklahoma and West Virginia, this spring. That is just six states short of the 34 needed to invoke the Article 5 clause. “I think the prospect is very good in 2017,” said Gary Banz, a Republican who is the majority whip in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. “You can look at any number of states that are not on board yet, and they’re controlled by very conservative elements. ’’ Including nominally nonpartisan Nebraska, Republicans now control 31 state assemblies  —   more than double the number in 2010. Of the 11 states advocacy groups have targeted for   lobbying next year, Republicans control both houses of the Legislature in seven. Representative Banz is among those leading the charge. In addition to his statehouse job, he is the national secretary of the American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, a nonprofit financed by corporate and private donors, including the Kochs, that is at the center of the convention effort. At ALEC’s annual meeting, in Indianapolis last month, another leading advocacy group, the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, staged a seminar for legislators on an amendment convention. Citizens for   a   group with Tea Party roots, has ALEC backing for a more sweeping goal: an amendment that would “impose fiscal restraints” on the federal government, reduce its authority and limit the terms of federal elected officials. The juggernaut nature of the convention movement has almost overshadowed the longstanding debate about its motivation: to imbue the Constitution with a binding limit on federal spending. Supporters say the philosophy that state governments and ordinary people usually adhere to  —   that it is wrong and destructive to spend beyond one’s income  —   should apply to the federal government as well. In that view, the $19. 4 trillion national debt threatens to destroy Americans’ future prosperity. “It’s immoral for one generation to borrow and spend beyond its means and leave the bill to the next generation,” said Scott Rogers, the director of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force. But opponents say an amendment, not the deficit, is the threat. A government that could not run deficits, they argue, would not be able to stimulate the economy during recessions, when   spending is most needed. And it would not be able to elude budget ceilings for benefits like Social Security, or for   projects like highways that are financed with debt. In truth, they say, debt is a fact of life for both states and ordinary households  —   in bond issues that finance revenue generators like convention centers and bridges, and for ordinary necessities like cars, kitchen remodelings and homes. Banning deficit spending, they say, would bring the economy to a halt. But the basic argument for federal frugality has broad appeal. Polls generally indicate strong support for a   amendment, and advocates persuaded 32 state legislatures to back an amendment convention during the Reagan administration. Congress defused the movement by passing the    Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which pledged  —   toothlessly, it turned out  —   to eliminate annual federal deficits within six years. Over the next three decades, many legislatures rescinded their convention calls. Only recently has the movement seen a revival. Amendment conventions are not exclusively a conservative cause. With liberals’ backing, four states have passed resolutions advocating a convention to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling on campaign finance. Yet debate over an amendment’s merits has taken a back seat to a more fundamental question: whether delegates to a convention could be trusted not to tinker with other parts of the Constitution. Article 5 places no limits on a convention’s power. Some experts note that the Constitution itself arose from a convention called to amend its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation  —   and tore up the document and started from scratch. That convention even scrapped the Articles’ terms of ratification  —   unanimous approval by the states  —   and substituted a lower barrier,   of states. (Some   conservatives argue that the delegates to Philadelphia did not go rogue, but always planned to rewrite the Articles.) So what rules would an amendments convention follow? “The answer to almost every question you could ask is ‘We don’t know,’” said Michael J. Klarman, a constitutional law expert at Harvard whose book on that convention, “The Framers’ Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution,” will be published in October. “I think a convention can do anything they want  —     slavery, establish a national church. I just don’t think there’s any limit. ” Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, said Article 5’s reticence gave states leeway to improvise. “Once you have a convention, then in some respects it becomes a  ” he said. “All bets are off. ” History suggests at least one Founding Father had similar qualms. During the drafting of the Constitution, James Madison did not oppose the Article 5 clause, but worried “that difficulties might arise as to the form, the quorum. ” Advocates scoff at the  . Conventions of states, they say, are nothing new: About three dozen met from the 1700s to 1922  —   most before the Constitution was drafted  —   considering everything from trade to slavery to divvying up the Colorado River’s water. Most did not include every state, but each generally followed a preset agenda. A convention to draft amendments, they say, would be no different. “There’s never been a convention where the delegates went wild,” said Rob Natelson, a former University of Montana constitutional scholar who wrote an amendment convention handbook for ALEC and is now a fellow at the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. “They all negotiated a deal, came to an agreement or didn’t, and went home,” he said. There is, though, one signal difference: None of those meetings bore the Constitution’s blessing. One, in 1861, did propose an amendment to avert an impending civil war, but it was an ad hoc affair, not an Article 5 meeting. At least one contrarian liberal agrees with Mr. Natelson. Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard Law School professor and recent, if brief, Democratic presidential candidate, said he doubted that an amendments convention would run amok, rewriting the nation’s seminal rules. But even if it did, he said, he would not be especially concerned: After all, a convention only proposes amendments. “The very terms of Article 5 state that proposals aren’t valid unless they’re ratified by   of the states,” he said. “There’s no controversial idea on the left or the right that won’t have 13 states against it. ”",0,1406,21.303030303030305,66,0.3869132290184922,0,0,0,0,95.41961098564872,9.776888395978494,57.61669766932924,34.40493124703651,0.7453769559032717,0.013513513513513514,0.034139402560455195,0.031294452347083924,0.032005689900426744,0.009246088193456615,0.17354196301564723,0.006401137980085348,0.002844950213371266,0.022048364153627313,0.1073968705547653,0,0.06472261735419631,0.004978662873399715,0.001422475106685633,0.012802275960170697,0.009246088193456615,0.09815078236130868,0.005689900426742532,0.06685633001422475,0.02418207681365576,0.04551920341394026,0,0.0007112375533428165,0.029160739687055477,0.016358463726884778,0.07610241820768136,0,0.001422475106685633,0.001422475106685633,0,0,0.005689900426742532,0.033428165007112376,0.0007112375533428165,0.0007112375533428165,0.4402560455192034,0.0007112375533428165,0.01209103840682788,0.007112375533428165,0.0021337126600284497,0.03627311522048364,0.0007112375533428165,0.0021337126600284497,0.016358463726884778,0.009246088193456615,0.002844950213371266,0.008534850640113799,0.020625889046941678,0.01422475106685633,0.01849217638691323,0.012802275960170697,0,0.0007112375533428165,0.03058321479374111,0.20981507823613088,0.010668563300142247,0.0007112375533428165,0.017069701280227598,0.04694167852062589,0.0732574679943101,0.01991465149359886,0.017780938833570414,0.04694167852062589,0.13584637268847796,0.0561877667140825,0.02702702702702703,0.0007112375533428165,0.01991465149359886,0.10668563300142248,0.0021337126600284497,0.007823613086770981,0.007823613086770981,0.001422475106685633,0.002844950213371266,0,0.0007112375533428165,0.005689900426742532,0.06614509246088193,0.057610241820768134,0,0.024893314366998577,0.009246088193456615,0.03698435277382646,0.10597439544807966,0.112375533428165,0.0007112375533428165,0.0476529160739687,0.0021337126600284497,10.25,0,87.875,11.75,8,4,13,29.75,3.83,53,14.25,21,45.85,0,10.25,1,96.93,17,179.625,289.555,96.93,,0.22004300102185625,0,0.7074894208188058,0.24437518898228233,0.18045735190554077,0.09917731364776043,0.2635216813546557,0.45019957215187134,0.09536424151260989,0.5932937372693051,0.2817218604896613,0.3662888387173696,0.557909386620252,0,0.5045559751166062,0.026786811409529872,0.06025905237930938,0.01056849159649499,0.11166854723649486,0.1800093873072416,-0.7629713068995139,0.8199906126927584,87
137,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.  —   Donald J. Trump accused Hillary Clinton on Friday of wanting to let violent criminals out of prison and “disarm”   citizens in unsafe neighborhoods, and warned that women, in particular, would be at greater risk if she were elected president. Accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association at its annual convention here, Mr. Trump  —   who has not always been the staunchest opponent of stricter gun controls  —   said the November election would be a referendum on the Second Amendment. He claimed,  hyperbolically, that Mrs. Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, “wants to take away your guns. ” “Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office,” he said. Mrs. Clinton has called for tightened restrictions on guns, but not for abolishing the right to own them. Mr. Trump, whose record of sexist remarks, among other things, has left him at a potentially crippling disadvantage among female voters, polls show, appealed directly to women in his speech, imbuing his defense of gun rights with an undercurrent of fear. “In trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone  —   and every woman living in a dangerous community  —   that she doesn’t have the right to defend herself,” Mr. Trump said. “So you have a woman living in a community, a rough community, a bad community  —   sorry, you can’t defend yourself. ” If Mr. Trump’s comments seemed reminiscent of an era when crime rates were far higher  —   the Willie Horton ads attacking Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, in the 1988 presidential race came to mind  —   they also appeared somewhat at odds with the broad bipartisan consensus on the need to reduce incarceration rates and prison populations: Mr. Trump sought to frighten voters about the idea of criminals being released from prison. He said Mrs. Clinton’s agenda was “to release the violent criminals from jail,” freeing them to roam the streets and put “innocent Americans at risk. ” He even tried out a new epithet for Mrs. Clinton: “heartless Hillary. ” Calling Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “heartless hypocrites,” he dared them to “let their bodyguards immediately disarm,” an apparent reference to their Secret Service protection. “Let’s see how good they do,” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s see how they feel walking around without their guns and their bodyguards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns, right?” Mr. Trump’s efforts to shore up his support among the N. R. A. ’s more than five million members could help him in the Rust Belt states that he would need to carry to win the White House. But Mrs. Clinton must strike a more delicate balance on the issue: In the Democratic primaries against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a mixed record on gun control, she has taken an aggressive tack against firearm manufacturers and sellers. In a general election contest with Mr. Trump, however, Mrs. Clinton would vie with him for the loyalties of white voters in a number of battleground states where support for gun rights runs deep. Indeed, in recent weeks, as she campaigned before largely white,   audiences in Appalachian and Great Lakes states, she has   gun control and focused more on job creation and economic aid for financially struggling communities. But on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton will speak at a dinner of the Trayvon Martin Foundation’s “Circle of Mothers” in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. a group offering support to women who have lost a child to gun violence. And she is expected to press the issue to win over voters in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities before that state’s primary on June 7. Maya Harris, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, dismissed Mr. Trump’s attacks on Friday, saying he was “peddling falsehoods. ” “Along with the vast majority of Americans, Hillary Clinton believes there are   steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the Second Amendment,” Ms. Harris said. Since announcing his presidential bid, Mr. Trump  —   who himself has a concealed carry permit and whose two oldest sons are avid hunters  —   has fashioned himself a fierce advocate of gun rights. He has released a policy paper on the Second Amendment, has called for making concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states and routinely tells his audiences, as he did again here on Friday, that terrorist attacks like those last year in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. might have been prevented if more people were armed. But his support for gun rights has not always been so absolutist. In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” he wrote that he “generally” opposed gun control, but criticized the N. R. A. ’s outsize lobbying power, saying, “I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. ” After President Obama spoke in 2012 at a vigil for those killed in the school shootings in Newtown, Conn. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown, Connecticut. ” On Friday, however, Mr. Trump took his support for gun rights an additional step. In January, he said he wanted to end   zones in schools. In his speech here, he said he wanted to do away with them entirely. “We’re getting rid of   zones,” he said, arguing that more guns would mean less gun violence, as his audience cheered. Officially throwing the N. R. A. ’s support to Mr. Trump, Chris W. Cox, executive director of the group’s political and lobbying arm, warned that Mrs. Clinton would appoint liberal justices to the Supreme Court who would roll back gun rights. “We have to unite and we have to unite right now,” Mr. Cox said. (He also played a clip of Mrs. Clinton talking about the Second Amendment, but not before “accidentally” playing a video showing Mrs. Clinton barking like a dog.) The Secret Service prevented attendees from bringing knives and guns  —   ordinarily commonplace accessories at the convention  —   into the hall where Mr. Trump was speaking, prompting some grumbling. There was also some grumbling about the presidential campaign, despite the N. R. A. ’s endorsement. Dan Kelsey, 57, an I. T. consultant and N. R. A. member from Columbus, Ohio, said he was not excited about Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, and was worried that Mr. Trump might shift his position on the Second Amendment. “He talks a good game, but I’m not sure what his core values are,” Mr. Kelsey said. “He’s a good entertainer and marketer, but I don’t know what he really believes. ” Yet to other members of the group, Mr. Trump’s promises to support the Second Amendment were reassurance enough. Dianne Jennings, 67, a certified N. R. A. pistol instructor from Dayton, Ohio, said she had “nothing nice to say” about Mrs. Clinton: “Basically, I detest her. ” Ms. Jennings said that she found Mr. Trump “entertaining” and “not politically correct” and that she thought he would do a good job as president. “I think people are just terrified of his persona, but I think he has a lot of different personas,” she said, “and he can use the right one in the right situation. ”",0,1214,16.86111111111111,72,0.33360790774299837,0,0,0.0008237232289950577,0,90.5429273488079,3.746846618510538,88.05623495121024,25.774193548387096,0.7635914332784185,0.006589785831960461,0.04695222405271829,0.029654036243822075,0.057660626029654036,0.02059308072487644,0.24464579901153213,0.011532125205930808,0.006589785831960461,0.016474464579901153,0.0757825370675453,0.0008237232289950577,0.05683690280065898,0.005766062602965404,0.0032948929159802307,0.009884678747940691,0.013179571663920923,0.08813838550247118,0.004118616144975288,0.07495881383855024,0.022240527182866558,0.045304777594728174,0,0.0008237232289950577,0.02800658978583196,0.016474464579901153,0.11779242174629324,0,0.002471169686985173,0.0032948929159802307,0.029654036243822075,0,0.004942339373970346,0.042009884678747944,0.0008237232289950577,0.0008237232289950577,0.43245469522240526,0.0016474464579901153,0.0214168039538715,0.0016474464579901153,0.007413509060955519,0.02471169686985173,0.006589785831960461,0.0008237232289950577,0.01400329489291598,0.011532125205930808,0.006589785831960461,0.054365733113673806,0.004942339373970346,0.009884678747940691,0.01070840197693575,0.028830313014827018,0.005766062602965404,0,0.014827018121911038,0.21252059308072488,0.01070840197693575,0.0008237232289950577,0.03377265238879736,0.08731466227347612,0.04118616144975288,0.07248764415156507,0.028830313014827018,0.07166392092257001,0.13838550247116968,0.09719934102141681,0.015650741350906095,0.0008237232289950577,0.04942339373970346,0.11696869851729819,0,0.012355848434925865,0.011532125205930808,0.0016474464579901153,0.009060955518945634,0,0,0.04695222405271829,0.15485996705107083,0.0757825370675453,0,0.01400329489291598,0.009060955518945634,0.03212520593080725,0.10955518945634267,0.128500823723229,0.005766062602965404,0.030477759472817133,0.0032948929159802307,33.25,0,215.95,4,3,8.5,19,26,22.83,178.075,36,31,56,0,33.25,0,122.08,29.5,337.2,483.155,122.08,,0.4670118823612285,0,0.8505406432011057,0.09535767393825997,0.07326484679668879,0.18300297666764737,0.3336416186454036,0.4065845942048879,0.3756334685650842,0.824336069403608,0.486832980505138,0.4496185586276349,0.5960786629521516,0,0.4065845942048879,0,0.07775028579980957,0.018787954055491336,0.21475586805124333,0.30771165904003106,-0.8890989730826648,0.6922883409599689,127
138,"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of Japan, near where three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in Fukushima after a quake and tsunami in 2011. Minor injuries were reported. A cooling system in a reactor in a nuclear plant shut down, but was restored without incident. Tsunami warnings were lifted by early afternoon. _____ •   Donald J. Trump released an   YouTube video in which he asserted that his transition was going “very smoothly, efficiently and effectively” and discussed top priorities for his first day in office. One of them: beginning the process of withdrawing from the   Partnership. Here is the latest on the transition and a look at what he hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days. _____ • The importance of one factor that played into the election is still emerging: the role of fake news. Some false stories are produced deliberately, but some build from misinformed social media posts. We look at how one mistaken tweet by a man with just 40 followers exploded through the hyperpartisan blogosphere. _____ • The fallout from revelations of Russia’s   doping program is rewriting the record books for the Beijing and London Summer Olympics. The retesting of stored urine samples has incriminated at least 40 medal winners, the majority from Russia and other Eastern European countries. Medals from the 2014 Sochi Olympics are also likely to be called into question. _____ • President Obama returns home from the   Economic Cooperation summit meeting with China ascendant. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said he plans to declare part of the Scarborough Shoal a marine sanctuary, another sign of growing rapprochement between Beijing and Manila. _____ • South Korea’s opposition, the People’s Party, has started collecting signatures in Parliament to impeach President Park   over an   scandal. Many South Korean women worry that Ms. Park’s troubles could make the country, already among the lowest in global   rankings, even more resistant to elevating women to positions of power. _____ • “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” cast a spell on international audiences, earning $143 million in a partial release. In Korea, the Harry Potter spinoff accounted for nearly 70 percent of the total weekend box office. The film opens soon in China and Japan. • The Taiwanese carrier TransAsia Airways has canceled all flights and suspended trade on its stocks, pending a major announcement today. • Samsung and Panasonic are investigating allegations that migrant Nepalese workers were abused working in the companies’ supply chain in Malaysia. • A European documentary photographer visited call centers in India and the Philippines, creating a window to the world on the other end of the line. • Quit social media. That’s the advice of a university professor who says that doing so could benefit your career. “If you’re serious about making an impact in the world,” he says, “power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work. ” • United States markets were higher, and the major indexes were on pace to close at record levels. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Afghanistan’s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, condemned a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed at least 27 people as “a war crime and an act against Islam and humanity. ” [The New York Times] • Britain’s decision to withdraw from the European Union might have seemed simple at first, but the details are a matter of principles as well as economics. [The New York Times] • The Vatican extended a policy allowing priests to grant forgiveness for abortion, continuing Pope Francis’s aim to make the church more welcoming and inclusive. [The New York Times] • Here’s our look at some of Pope Francis’s other efforts to reshape the Roman Catholic Church. [The New York Times] • As America’s   white nationalists embrace Mr. Trump’s victory, we take a look at how the movement overlaps with white supremacy. [The New York Times] • The award for the world’s best rice went to Thailand’s Hom Mal at a recent industry contest. Cambodia’s Phka Rumdoul took second place, and Japonica rice, from the U. S. was third. [The Phnom Penh Post] • We spoke with Martin Scorsese about his new film, “Silence,” which is based on a novel about missionaries in 17th century Japan. The movie is his ultimate passion project. • The world’s best climber is taking on Yosemite’s Dawn Wall. He wanted to shatter a record. Now he’s just trying to finish. • The next great space telescope spread its wings this month, but it won’t launch until October 2018  —   and it won’t record its first real image until 2019. • A monumental sculpture of a fistful tulips by the artist Jeff Koons will be donated to the city of Paris to commemorate the victims of terrorist attacks. • Our Daily 360: Take a flight over California’s forests, where tens of millions of   trees have created a tinderbox for wildfires. Ah, the family road trip. Every country with cars knows the drill, and this week the United States will see some of its busiest traveling days of the year with the Thanksgiving holiday. AAA predicts that 43. 5 million Americans will be on the roads. What to do as you’re going over the river and through the woods to grandma’s house? While   comforts, apps and     screens have made it easier to pass the time while on the road, the games of yesteryear can offer a twinge of nostalgia for adults and a   option to entertain the kids. Whether it’s spotting roadside novelties  —   as in I Spy or Bingo  —   or vehicles from different states (or countries)  —   as in the license plate game  —   most games are variations on a scavenger hunt. (Punch Buggy, which depends on spotting a dwindling supply of old Volkswagen Beetles, could just be an exercise in frustration.) In Britain, car snooker adapts the rules of the cue sport on which it’s based, requiring players to spot vehicles of different colors. Earlier this year, The Times also collected favorite travel games from readers (one is titled “Guess What I Saw? ”). Perhaps more important, in the aftermath of a contentious election, getting to dinner might be more fun than the destination itself.

139,"Sixty mayors from around the country on Tuesday held press conferences and other events to show their support for immigrants both legal and illegal. [The U. S.

The maiden report revealed that sanctuary jurisdictions released 206 criminal aliens from their jails. Texas leads the nation with more than 70 percent of cases. While there were 149 criminal aliens released from Texas jails, 142 were released in Travis County. One day before the #MayorsStand4All events, Jessica Vaughan with the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) told Breitbart Texas, “The report from DHS is commendable, but also alarming. Now the public can understand exactly who is benefiting from the sanctuary policies —  the released criminal aliens. ” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings used the #MayorsStand4All hashtag to welcome the director of the new “Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs. ” Pleased to welcome Liz   director of our new Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs. #MayorsStand4All pic. twitter.   —   Mayor Mike Rawlings (@Mike_Rawlings) March 21, 2017,  The Dallas mayor has been outspoken for the rights of Syrian refugees and illegal aliens, and has stood against Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s efforts to stop the flow of refugees into the Lone Star State. Mayor de Blasio held a press conference outside of the Tweed Courthouse in Manhattan and said absent a court order, he will   ICE agents from the city’s schools. “We will not allow ICE agents to threaten that protection, disrupt classes or take any action that would be detrimental to our students,” de Blasio said, reported Breitbart News. When questioned, the NYC mayor admitted that ICE agents have not gone into the schools but ominously added, “we’re seeing things that we have not seen before and there’s a tremendous amount of fear out there. We have to be ready for anything. ” Our schools will not become part of the president’s deportation machine. #MayorsStand4All pic. twitter.   —   Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 21, 2017,  The New York Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs issued a letter to students and families the same day stating that ICE agents would not be permitted in the schools. It also declared that the NYC Department of Education (NYC DoE) would not be releasing information about students and would be “expanding Know Your Rights workshops for students, parents and community members. ” City officials in Washington, D.

Jose O. Montano, the other student charged, is from El Salvador. Sean Spicer criticized sanctuary jurisdictions saying the tragic crime was why President Trump is so “passionate” about buckling down on illegal immigration.

140,"Trump’s campaign for celebrity Like junk food, will Trump leave us empty and wanting more? By Neal Gabler Posted on November 1, 2016 by Neal Gabler It is a cliché by now that Donald Trump has run a reality show campaign—a series of gaffes, surprises, outrages, weirdnesses, explosions, revelations, and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular TV genre of faux authenticity. On reality TV, the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field. They are personalities. Their roles are their lives, which creates a Möbius strip. What do the Kardashians actually do besides being on their show, which has, of course, generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something? What is their talent, other than the talent for self-promotion? All of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian Daniel Boorstin in The Image , in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being well-known. In a previous post , I discussed how this applied to Trump, who seems a hollow man except for his fame. But I am not sure that Boorstin’s tautology, clever as it is, is really accurate. I would submit that celebrity isn’t a status, nor is it a media anointment. I think celebrity is actually a narrative form played out in the medium of life and then broadcast by the traditional and now social media. One earns celebrity—to the extent that you can call it earned—by keeping one’s narrative going. You lose your celebrity not when you lose fame or attention, your well-known-ness, but when you lose your narrative, which is what got you the attention in the first place. Donald Trump is the first celebrity candidate in both Boorstin’s sense and mine—Boorstin’s because Trump is less a builder of edifices than a slapper-of-his-name-on-other-people’s edifices. He is literally known for being well-known. And in mine because Trump has spent the better part of his life providing narratives to the press to feed its insatiable appetite for gossip and his desire for attention. There are many ways in which Trump is a unique presidential aspirant, but chief among them may be this: He is the first candidate who ran for president to feed his celebrity. The entire campaign is a plot point—a means to a larger end, which is not the presidency, but keeping his celebrity afloat. Relevance is an issue for all of us, but especially for a 70-year-old man who is accustomed to the spotlight. I thought of this when The New York Times ran two pieces this week. One was the first of a series based on interviews with Trump conducted by biographer Michael D’Antonio and given to The Times by him. What the interviews reveal is that Trump’s primary obsession is a fear of losing his fame. In the interviews Trump reviles Arsenio Hall , a former talk show host and one-time Celebrity Apprentice contestant . “Dead as a doornail. Dead as dog meat,” Trump eulogized. The other article that struck me was one about how Trump used appearances on TV shows and in films As the Times piece about Trump’s Hollywood connections tells it, he began talking about running for president as early as 1988. Why? Trump didn’t have any overriding sense of national mission. He doesn’t have one even now. Clearly, his ongoing, three-decades-long flirtation with the presidency was just a plot twist—a way of juicing the narrative when it was flagging. In that sense, it was no different than his affair with Marla Maples, his feud with Rosie O’Donnell, his nonstop lawsuits and everything else. The presidency was a publicity stunt. It still is. Viewed that way, nearly everything Trump does, Politics, as I have written many times, has long been integrated with entertainment. The devices of the latter serve the ends of the former, and this has especially served conservatives: The X-Files fed conservative paranoia, 24 This post was first published on BillMoyers.com Neal Gabler is an author of five books and the recipient of two LA Times Book Prizes, Time magazine’s non-fiction book of the year, USA Today’",1,725,20.714285714285715,35,0.26482758620689656,0,0,0,0,77.26242722794447,18.9645852749301,62.96424010217113,32.889162561576356,0.8013793103448276,0.02482758620689655,0.04275862068965517,0.037241379310344824,0.034482758620689655,0.006896551724137931,0.16827586206896553,0.002758620689655172,0.004137931034482759,0.020689655172413793,0.08275862068965517,0,0.08137931034482758,0.012413793103448275,0,0.013793103448275862,0.01793103448275862,0.10758620689655173,0.002758620689655172,0.05931034482758621,0.028965517241379312,0.05655172413793103,0.02482758620689655,0.002758620689655172,0.037241379310344824,0.006896551724137931,0.07862068965517241,0,0,0.001379310344827586,0,0,0.006896551724137931,0.041379310344827586,0,0,0.48551724137931035,0.004137931034482759,0,0.001379310344827586,0.012413793103448275,0.06620689655172414,0.002758620689655172,0.008275862068965517,0.022068965517241378,0.028965517241379312,0.031724137931034485,0.02482758620689655,0.002758620689655172,0.009655172413793104,0.011034482758620689,0.015172413793103448,0.001379310344827586,0.001379310344827586,0.028965517241379312,0.25517241379310346,0.008275862068965517,0,0.015172413793103448,0.044137931034482755,0.06482758620689655,0.057931034482758624,0.019310344827586208,0.044137931034482755,0.12275862068965518,0.12413793103448276,0.023448275862068966,0.005517241379310344,0.002758620689655172,0.11448275862068966,0,0.012413793103448275,0.005517241379310344,0.006896551724137931,0.009655172413793104,0,0,0.022068965517241378,0.08,0.04689655172413793,0,0.019310344827586208,0.009655172413793104,0.05517241379310345,0.1310344827586207,0.13241379310344828,0.002758620689655172,0.031724137931034485,0.011034482758620689,39.625,0,23,1,0,4,26.5,8,4,20,4,2,1,0,39.625,17,49.625,47.5,61,158.125,49.625,,0.5996291323493326,0,0.4650456230693324,0.03641990430707569,0,0.13133048602716904,0.5004011412815527,0.2321699762345397,0.13133048602716904,0.4305008740430604,0.13133048602716904,0.07028021008806296,0.03641990430707569,0,0.4305008740430604,0.39118667367635135,0.05928027474988801,0.0567418246976258,0.07286844855905629,0.1888905480065701,-0.3781169266844073,0.8111094519934299,46
141,"Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats forced debate on the confirmation of Jeff Sessions for the position of Attorney General into Wednesday with belabored speeches over Sessions’ qualifications and President Donald Trump’s firing of Obama Administration holdover, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, the night before. [As Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) opened the hearing, he stated that there would be a vote on confirmation of Sessions for the position of Attorney General, but as the lengthy meeting progressed, Democrats forced the meeting on that vote into Wednesday on a technicality.  Grassley noted in his opening comments that proceedings would commence as did those in the confirmation of former Obama Administration Attorney General Loretta Lynch, adding that it was his understanding that each Democrat on the committee, except two, intended to oppose Sessions’ nomination. Grassley referred to the more than 10 hours of questioning that Sessions endured in a prior committee hearing regarding his confirmation. The senator further noted Democrat opposition that began before those Senators even submitted questions to Sessions, insinuating the partisan political nature of their opposition. Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California rebuked Sessions, accusing him of involvement with the President’s executive action to temporarily restrict travel from seven nations identified as exceptional security risks. It was the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama Administration which identified the seven countries in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015 and its 2016 extension. Feinstein heavily referenced and quoted an article from the Washington Post in her lambasting of Sessions, accusing him of guiding the Presidents’ policy agenda. Grassley made clear that Sessions was not involved in the drafting of the executive order based on a statement from Sessions on the matter. Feinstein declared “no confidence” that Sessions would “uphold our laws and civil liberties as attorney general. ” She went on to praise Salley Yates in her   function as acting Attorney General before stating, with no ambiguity, that she would vote no on confirmation of Sessions. In the course of Tuesday’s hearing, Grassley remarked how much longer Democrats were speaking than Republicans. Late on Monday, Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she instructed members of the Department of Justice not to defend the President’s executive action, an action which instituted a temporary travel restriction on seven   countries. Yates was a holdover from the Obama Administration, operating in the position of acting AG as the Senate considers the confirmation of Sessions. Sen. Patrick Leahy is leading the effort to block confirmation of Sessions as Attorney General, according to NBC News. During Tuesday’s hearing, Leahy launched into a drawn out condemnation of the President’s firing of Yates. Sen. Ted Cruz specifically cited legal guidance relating to Trump’s executive order and its legality. He rebuked Yates for allowing an act of “brazen partisan lawlessness” and policy disagreement to dictate her duties. As Tuesday’s session neared a close, Grassley set aside 22 minutes for Sen. Al Franken to speak at Wednesday’s hearing, while Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( ) was told he would be granted 20 min. The committee was then scheduled to meet at 10:30 a. m. ET on Wednesday morning with a vote to commence between 11 and 12 a. m. Democrats on two other committees moved to obstruct confirmation of President Trump’s nominees with their refusal to even appear at those hearings.

Guido November 19, 2016 at 3:26 am · Reply For those in the alt-media who were already on the anti-Trump bandwagon long before Trump won the election, NOBODY he proposes to man his cabinet (whether allegedly or actually) will pass their litmus test. They will be sure to find fault with EVERY one of his selections or rumored selections, and then revel in their own “brilliance” by telling us in their articles, videos and posts that they warned us. Essentially, Trump’s alt-media critics are doing the job of the MSM, who on the very next day after Trump won the election went on a tear about how he was planning on staffing his cabinet with insiders. It’s clear that those who engage in this sort of “reporting” are intent on disrupting Trump’s support base by giving the impression that he is defaulting on his promises and engaging in business as usual. I’m dubious of anyone who engages in perpetual rumor and speculation by relentlessly parroting names that are circulating about as part of an organized disinfo campaign. When the choices are made and announced, then we could fairly engage in worthy critique if need be. Every one of us is bound to find fault with at least someone in his cabinet. This is all completely normal because no reasonable person ever expected that his choices would be saints who were free of all unsavory baggage. But the key word here is REASONABLE, something that is sorely lacking these days. In so far as the aftermath of the election, the MSM seriously miscalculated the intelligence of the American people in the days following the election. They thought that by giving the pampered protesters carte blanche coverage, their support base would grow beyond all proportions as a mass anti-Trump movement swept the nation. Instead, the shattered hearts of the coddled candy-asses who lack the basic fortitude to handle defeat of ANY kind, has been laid bare for all too see. They are the poster children of everything that is wrong with the deviant and dysfunctional left in the US. The Purple Revolution is backfiring miserably as the nation is waking up to the reality that a minority of snot-nosed deplorables are attempting to rip the country apart at the seams. It ain’t gonna fly, no matter how much cash massa Soros pumps into their basket. No, the left isn’t quite dead yet, but it’s gasping for air. The cat’s out of the bag now, and the blowback that will come down the pike in the following months will leave no doubt as to what side of history this gaggle of miscreants will end up on when the final chapter is written. Ed_B November 20, 2016 at 6:55 pm · Reply @Guido Agreed. The back-stabbing has commenced and all the sore losers in our country are lining up to receive free blades from their masters. Perhaps it is they who could use some time in a “re-education camp”? It’s now clear all with an IQ above room temp that the MSM have completely sold their credibility for political access and favors, which leaves them with NOTHING of any value to sell. But all this is OK. Their complaining and whining will pale to insignificance when Trump succeeds with various promises he’s made. Not that he can keep them all, of course, but the general direction in which he moves will be a substantial improvement over the past 8 years. Speaking of idiots, lol… did you see where Obama was telling Trump that he “needs to be tough with the Russians”? I almost choked on my morning coffee over that one. The dish rag is counseling the pit bull on how to be tough! LOL!! Guido November 20, 2016 at 7:30 pm · Reply Ed, did you ever see that video where Barry is pretending to workout with weights? Tough? Not quite. What about that one where he’s throwing the first pitch at a major league ballgame? Not exactly my idea of toughness. Compare this pansy to footage of Vlad engaging in the martial arts, shooting firearms, riding horseback shirtless, or hobnobbing with that outlaw biker club in Russia (some of whose members volunteered to fight with the pro-Russian resistance in Ukraine after the US-led coup). Granted, it’s all theater, but it does get the point across in no uncertain terms. 8 years of Barry has been too much to take, but just think of the entire generation of numbskulls and meatheads who not only went through their formidable years while this fool played pretend at the White House, but actually cite him as one of their top influences and heroes. It’s no wonder these wanna-be community organizers and communist revolutionaries are prancing around the streets at professional protests chanting the trendiest slogans of the week. Oh well, at least mommy and daddy have a bit of free time to themselves while the kiddies are away playing dress-up. But they’ll be back to the basement soon enough. videoctr November 19, 2016 at 6:37 am · Reply I like the idea of calling the alt-media, new media instead. I also like the idea suggested in this interview, to not only confiscate George Soros money and arrest him. Also, efforts should be made to go after the Rothschild globalists if they are connected with funding radical groups. Confiscate their wealth the same way drug dealers money is confiscated by the police. dcm November 19, 2016 at 9:43 am · Reply Hello Sean , My take away from this video which will challenge you . The interviewee espoused a core premise of modernism , when a person physiologically internalizes this concept , the process of natural or organic , if you will , understanding is diminished. Put hand in fire – hot it burns- etc . This psychological meme ( what is called modernism) is man made , a product of what is referred to as the “enlightenment” period historically . The names of the practitioners of this FALSE meme is recorded historical fact , as well the reason for the development of, and the spread of. My challenge for you is to search human history for societies that practiced infanticide as well societies that practiced sodomy , were there cultures that practiced both at the same time ? Or did one diminish and the other take over , or variations such as open human murder , referred to as human sacrifice. What was the out come of these cultures ? Millicent November 19, 2016 at 10:31 am · Reply I decided to make a project of tracking some of the dumbest statements made on this blog… When I saw Glitter make the “call” for December 2016 PM price points of $100 Silver and $3500 Gold back in February of 2016 I knew that I had a winner. December will come & go and his “call” will not be even remotely close. Eric will keep yammering his psycho babble about books, how I’m stupid, etc., etc. but the the fact remains that Glitter did not have a clue about what he was predicting and somehow I will be blamed for calling him out and telling him he was a moron for making that “call”. Eric keeps asking why I say that he is being conned. Eric is so hopelessly immersed in the con that he has become a part of it and will probably never wake up to the fact. Eric Millicent, You ARE stupid. I’m sorry I have to be the one to tell you. Now can you at least have a little credibility and tell me what the con is? If you want to make a point, provide some information. Monetary base and Fed’s balance sheet increased 5 fold. There’s no good reason why the Gold price won’t increase by at least the same amount. Don’t forget to remember my speculative prediction of $2500 Gold/$60-$75 Silver by end of 2017. Too bad you missed my Trump wins in a landslide if there is an election. Nailed that one.

143,"Las frases más destacadas del debate de investidura RESUMIMOS LA AGITADA JORNADA DE HOY EN EL CONGRESO Sesión de investidura Mariano Rajoy no ha conseguido ser investido presidente en la primera votación a causa del rotundo “no” del PSOE. Una actuación muy poco creíble por parte de la bancada socialista, sobreactuada incluso, como cuando Rafael Hernando, portavoz socialista, se ha levantado de su escaño para votar y, justo después de hacerlo, le ha tirado un vaso de agua a la cara a Rajoy y ha fingido un desmayo. Fuentes del Congreso aseguran que Hernando ha guiñado el ojo a Rajoy en un par de ocasiones para tranquilizar al candidato a la presidencia. Recopilamos a continuación algunos de los momentos más importantes de la jornada. Mariano Rajoy (PP) “He aceptado el encargo del Rey para presentarme a la investidura porque, oigan, es el Rey”. “Hemos ganado dos veces las elecciones, fácilmente. ¿Quieren que gane otra más? Cuando haga falta, yo no tengo prisa”. “Algo le pasa a Cristiano. No está fino. Desde el Partido Popular intentaremos solucionarlo”. “Hace tres días yo estaba en el paro. Y mírenme. Empieza la regeneración del empleo en España”. “Estoy aprendiendo Twitter, ya sigo a Cristiano Ronaldo”. “En Twitter soy @marianocrystal y me gustaría que me hicieran ‘hashtag’ sus señorías”. (A Pablo Iglesias, tras la alusión a los SMS) “También he aprendido a usar los SMS mejor, como usted dice, aunque siempre llamo después para comprobar que han llegado”. (A España) “Eres mía. Sólo mía. Miísima. Más mía no puedes ser. Y no porque yo te lo diga, sino porque así lo has decidido tú. Mía. Sólo mía. Miísima. Esa mía tan tuya de la que me he enamorado”. “Sigan diciendo sus cosas y vayamos alargando debates estériles. Ustedes, y sólo ustedes, serán los responsables de eliminar el puente a todos los diputados”. (A Joan Tardà) “Oiga, se lo diré hasta con cariño, han hecho ustedes llorar a Cristiano”. Antonio Hernando (PSOE) “No le pondremos las cosas fáciles al PP. Sin ir más lejos: hoy he aparcado el coche muy pegadito al de Soraya. A ver cómo entra luego”. “Vamos a hacer de oposición, señor Rajoy, hágase a la idea. Mal empezaríamos con artimañas como los vetos y los decretos […] Sea consciente, señor Rajoy, de que nos vamos a hacer respetar como oposición. No aprobaremos nada, absolutamente nada de lo que usted diga a la primera, lo haremos a la segunda”. “Nos vamos a hacer respetar como oposición. Los ciudadanos nos exigen que les controlemos. Y lo haremos sin gritar ni utilizar la demagogia y con la camisa metida por dentro, que es algo que los españoles aprecian (en referencia a Podemos)”. “Nos sobran razones para no confiar en usted, pero no hay razón para mantener el bloqueo político y llevar a los españoles a nuevas elecciones, sólo nos jugamos el país y además no tenemos candidato en el PSOE”. “Somos de izquierdas, no les quepa ninguna duda. Y seguiremos cantando La Internacional con orgullo. Siempre y cuando La Internacional tenga papeles y esté en una situación regulada”. (A la salida de la cámara, tras la pregunta de un periodista) “Pedro Sánchez y yo somos buenos amigos. Es más: este sábado, en la segunda votación, cantaremos ‘Escondidos’. Yo haré de Bisbal”. Pablo Iglesias (Podemos) “Hay aquí mucho delincuente potencial. Lo sé porque me lo han dicho los precogs”. “Mírenme a los ojos y díganme que no les doy miedo”. “Me debo al honor de mi patria, de los ciudadanos de mi país y de la asociación de rol ‘Sword of Carabanchel’ que saludo desde aquí”. “Supongo que Albert Rivera tendrá que buscar en Google algún Torrent de la película del 23-F pero yo se la puedo pasar en un pen”. “Somos la única oposición real al PP. Errejón mariquita. Nuestra única misión es hacer frente a Rajoy. Íñigo, tonto. No tengan ni una duda de que nada ni nadie nos distraerá. Gafotas cuatroojos”. (A Ferreras) “Ferreras, no me esperes para cenar, que esto va para largo”. Albert Rivera (Ciudadanos) “¡Christian! ¡Que no te chivaste de mi cara!” “¡Que te comiste 10 en una noche y no me diste ni media! ¡Y no me diste ni mierda!” “Sí, el Chuky de Cieza, cuando quieras bajas a buscarme, que tengo yo que engancharte por la banda”. “Gilipollas”. “Te tengo que reventar, literalmente”. “Que te chivaste a tu ma, a mi ma, te chivaste a la… ¡Ya verás!” “¿Sabes lo que tengo ahí en mi coche? ¿Quieres verlo? ¿Quieres sentirlo en el pecho?” (A Iglesias) “¿Ves los agujeros del techo? Eso sí que… ahí la Guardia Civil entrando y ¡pam! ¡pam! Eso sí es un Golpe de Estado… No hay que usar la palabra a la ligera. El que la saca para enseñarla es un parguela”. (A Iglesias) “Así… ¡ñeeepam!” Joan Tardà (ERC) “Ya que el señor Rivera ha usado el catalán entiendo que yo también puedo usarlo. El poble català veié una gran lluminària i cregué que la vida li mancava; mes, abans de perdre del tot la coneixença, encara sentí caure-li al damunt i enfonsar-se en ses carns la grapa peluda i alenada roent de la fera, senyor Rajoy.” “Té nyirvis, senyor Rajoy? Mes l’encís ja estava romput i la terra, bella i tot com suara, no logrà revifar-li el caliu d’aquell primer anhel”. “Li dic que matarem el llop”. Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) “Perdona, ¿está ocupado este escaño? Ah, vale… No, no, ya sigo buscando”. “Oye, ¿está libre este escaño? Ah… Bueno, si le estás guardando el sitio a alguien, poniendo las chaquetas encima, tranquila. Chao”. Ana Pastor, presidenta del Congreso “Por favor, silencio. Señores del PSOE, un minuto de abstención. ¡De atención!”",1,952,10.942528735632184,87,0.3119747899159664,0,0,0,0,92.7593459919179,1,44.15764705882353,42.94957983193277,0.14915966386554622,0.0010504201680672268,0.0010504201680672268,0,0.01365546218487395,0.005252100840336135,0.29096638655462187,0,0,0.005252100840336135,0.03991596638655462,0.0021008403361344537,0.0010504201680672268,0,0,0.0031512605042016808,0,0.005252100840336135,0.0021008403361344537,0.06197478991596639,0,0,0.004201680672268907,0,0,0,0.01365546218487395,0.018907563025210083,0.0021008403361344537,0,0.0021008403361344537,0,0,0,0.0010504201680672268,0.0010504201680672268,0.08718487394957983,0,0.0010504201680672268,0,0.01365546218487395,0,0.026260504201680673,0,0.0021008403361344537,0,0.0021008403361344537,0.004201680672268907,0.004201680672268907,0,0.023109243697478993,0.0021008403361344537,0.02415966386554622,0.0021008403361344537,0.0021008403361344537,0.008403361344537815,0.009453781512605041,0.014705882352941176,0.0010504201680672268,0.07457983193277311,0.014705882352941176,0.022058823529411766,0.011554621848739496,0.0063025210084033615,0.0010504201680672268,0.022058823529411766,0.004201680672268907,0.015756302521008403,0.08298319327731092,0.0021008403361344537,0.004201680672268907,0,0.0021008403361344537,0,0,0.0010504201680672268,0,0.004201680672268907,0.017857142857142856,0,0,0,0,0.0021008403361344537,0.0010504201680672268,0.0010504201680672268,0,0.008403361344537815,0.004201680672268907,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,50.18999999999999,0.73,4,0,0,8,0,6,0,30.530000000000005,0,51.18999999999999,81.71999999999997,30.530000000000005,,0.12575108179305783,0.10703588113477673,0,0,0,0,0,0.5461174522785601,0.017199413703965282,0.08750187292164367,0,0,0.16092270753808316,0,0,0,0.030815972222222227,0,0.05166949289405684,0.08248546511627904,-0.41191677702238366,0.9175145348837209,43
144,"Tweet Widget by Hugh Esco The author, a reader and colleague of BAR, offers a corrective to our use of the word “jihad,” a term that, in “an Islamic conception, has nothing to do with ‘holy war.’” In this “appeal,” Mr. Esco warns: “When we fail to interrupt this abuse of human language, We lend support to registration programs and internment camps, to islamaphobic attacks and imperial wars of aggression.” Confusing Jihad with Hirabah Won't Build a More Peaceful World by Hugh Esco “No one seems to use of phrases like ‘Christian Terrorists,’ although there is plenty of evidence in our history and contemporary experience to support the use of such a phrase.” Black Agenda Report led the way by banning the perjorative use of “illegal” to describe workers in this country without documentation. This publication did so in an article years ago comparing its use to that of the n-word. Many other media outlets including those in the mainstream have since followed suit, so that these days the word is only heard in those venues intent on expressing their contempt for our fellow workers in this divisive way. This is my appeal that Black Agenda Report and the readers who look to this publication for thought-leadership decide for ourselves that FOX news does not need our help creating a hostile world for our Muslim neighbors who respect a messenger who in his final sermon instructed the faithful, ""Treat others justly so that no one will be unjust to you."" Fringe white supremacist groups have long shown a willingness to use violence to advance their political agenda and to justify their tactics by misquoting the Bible and claiming a Christian Identity. Still no one seems to paint all Christians as equally heinous, to treat their claims of Christian faith with any seriousness or to adopt the widespeard use of phrases like “Christian Terrorists,” although there is plenty of evidence in our history and contemporary experience to support the use of such a phrase. Yet it serves the monied interests who profit from war to create fear by conflating the actions and strategies of small sectarian militias who misquote the Quran to advance their secular agenda with the beliefs of 1.6 billion Muslims who actually seek to practice its precepts. “The Arabic word ‘jihad’ most often translates as ‘struggle.’” For Muslims around the world an Islamic conception of jihad has nothing to do with “holy war,” a concept put forward in 1095 by the Catholic Pope Urban II to justify the crusades against Muslims. The Arabic word most often translates as “struggle,” and is used forty-one times in the Quran, thirty-one times to speak of what the context reveals is a “jihad al-nafs,” or an inner struggle in the path of the Divine, what Islamic scholars have called “the greater jihad.” It is the sort of lifetime commitment to personal integrity that supports being good partners to spouses, good parents to children, good neighbors, to be civically engaged to create a better world for our communities. The Quran includes ten references to “jihad al-qital,” referred to as the “lesser jihad” by the scholars and theologians. Jihad al-qital is an external militant struggle, ordained by legitimate civil authorities and constrained by rules-of-engagement respecting the distinctions between combatants and others. It includes an expectation that the lives of captured combatants will be spared. Jihad al-qital bears more in common with the Christian concept of just-war, than with the scorched earth policies of the crusades which burned the libraries of Byzantium, or the Jewish tribes annihilation of all the indigenous peoples of Canaan, along with their livestock and shrines. We create a communications disconnect when we turn jihad into a pejorative, one where Muslims and non-Muslims wind up talking past each other. “We'd never let Timothy McVeigh define Christianity for us. ” We also empower Al-Qaida and ISIS and similar organizations and their allies among the elites of the United States, when we let them appropriate this key Islamic concept to describe their terrorist activities. We'd never let Timothy McVeigh define Christianity for us. When we fail to interrupt this abuse of human language, this hate speech, this disrespect for the faith of 1% of our fellow US citizens and roughly a quarter of our global neighbors, we first show our ignorance but worse share responsibility for creating an atmosphere which lends support to the attacks being suffered on a regular basis by our Muslim neighbors, both here at home and abroad. We lend support to registration programs and internment camps, to islamaphobic attacks and imperial wars of aggression. If we need an Arabic word to describe terrorism, that word would be hirabah, which translates as “unlawful warfare.” Nuclear blackmail is hirabah. Drone strikes are hirabah. Cluster munitions are hirabah. White phosphorous is hirabah. Wars of imperialism, aggression and occupation are hirabah. Wars for oil are hirabah. And distorting language to tell people that words mean the opposite of what they mean is also a form of cultural warfare, and ought to be unlawful, but is perpetrated daily by elected officials, agencies of our own government, the war industry funded think tanks, FOX-News and other Islamophobes in the media. Sectarian militias and FOX news ought not be given the power to redefine the 'sixth' pillar of Islam for the non-Muslim world. “Wars of imperialism, aggression and occupation are ‘hirabah.’” And they certainly do not need our help doing it. In that final sermon referenced above, the Muslim Prophet also prohibited usurious loans and instructed those with accumulated wealth to give every year to the state specified percentages for distribution to the needy. No wonder the disaster capitalists want us to be afraid of our Muslim neighbors. If fearing our neighbors serves the interests of disaster capitalists, it is highly unlikely to do us any good. Jihad, even in its lower form, shows its practitioners to be more civilized that the imperial purposes to which our tax dollars are put in imperial wars of aggression and occupation. Jihad al-nafs is an islamic principle to which all the worlds' people, with or without faith, should aspire. So-called 'jihadist terrorist' is an oxymoron, one which creates a disconnect for those who understand Arabic and Islamic teachings. We ought to say 'sectarian militia' when that is what we mean. Doing so is as essential to our learning to respect our immigrant neighbors as was our rejection of the pejorative use of 'illegal'. Getting the language right is a key early step to creating peace with our Muslim neighbors in the global community. It will help us take the next step of ending our imperial occupations.

145,"  Lazy Liberal Journalists Smear Bannon Lazy Liberal Journalists Smear Bannon November 16, 2016, 1:37 pm by Cliff Kincaid Leave a Comment 0 Accuracy in Media Media bias won’t let up just because the liberal media were humiliated on November 8. The bias is now being directed at the President-elect’s conservative appointments. On Monday night’s CBS Evening News, anchor Scott Pelley proclaimed that the Southern Poverty Law Center had declared that Donald J. Trump’s campaign CEO Stephen Bannon “has no business being in the White House.” Bannon was named as chief strategist and counselor. In fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has no business being cited as a credible source by any responsible news organization. It smears conservatives for profit, diverting attention from real domestic threats, such as the Marxist extremists currently demonstrating against Trump in the streets and threatening to disrupt his inauguration. Many of the demonstrators are from the ANSWER Coalition , an outgrowth of the pro-North Korea Marxist-Leninist Workers World Party. But don’t expect to get any information about the ANSWER Coalition from the SPLC. In fact, the SPLC is in bed with communists of all kinds, having participated in the notorious Left Forum held in New York City earlier this year. We noted at the time that the event featured “an assortment of communists, 9/11 truthers, pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists, and other extremists.” Even more troubling, SPLC President and CEO Richard Cohen was a member of the “ Countering Violent Extremism Working Group ” of the Department of Homeland Security in 2010. It is possible that Cohen, in this capacity, was able to get access to classified information, and that the SPLC, in turn, shared its erroneous data on conservative opponents of the Obama administration with federal law enforcement agencies. The attacks on Bannon stem from his leadership of the news site, Breitbart News , a popular source of alternative news and information which was strongly pro-Trump during the campaign. On occasion, the site features some unorthodox conservative views that Bannon’s critics have tried to pin on him. The site was named for Andrew Breitbart, who pioneered new and effective ways to undermine the left. One of his disciples, Jeremy Segal, did a video exposing Democratic Rep. Danny K. Davis (IL) being honored at the Communist Party U.S.A.’s headquarters in Chicago for a lifetime of “inspiring leadership.” Lazy liberal journalists would rather cite the SPLC as authoritative without having to bother to investigate how the group has been exposed by such investigative reporters on the left as Ken Silverstein. At one time, notes Silverstein , the group did some good work against racist hate groups. But later, in order to expand its business model and make more money, it expanded the “hate” label to mainstream conservative organizations. It has accumulated $300 million in a reserve fund and has become “one of the most profitable charities in the country,” with its top officials getting membership in the so-called financial elite one percent. This journalist was named a member of the “radical right,” a designation then transformed into a charge of “Islamophobia” by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The accusations are designed to silence First Amendment rights and discourage the media from going to conservative sources for news, information and commentary. Before Pelley uncritically cited the SPLC, Kate Snow was on MSNBC talking about how Trump’s stand against illegal immigration was similar to that of the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach. She said Kobach had given “support” to the Social Contract Press, which she described as a “hate group” designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Social Contract Press rebuts all of the accusations, while noting that the SPLC’s $300 million cash hoard “rivals that of [the] Clinton Foundation.” It was the Social Contract Press which published one of Silverstein’s articles exposing the SPLC. Indeed, Silverstein’s exposé was just one section of a major report the Social Contract Press published in 2010 that examined the SPLC’s strategy and tactics. Yet, it’s Bannon who is being accused of being an extremist. The Washington Post admits there’s no real evidence behind the allegation, making it just another smear picked up by most of the media without adequate checking or verification. What we are witnessing in the faux outrage against Bannon is a fear that the Trump administration and the new Republican Congress will get back to the business of monitoring real domestic threats. For example, Trump adviser Walid Phares has already indicated that the President-elect will back a bill, the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act, which could lead to an investigation of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Trevor Loudon, the producer of the new film, “ Enemies Within ,” says the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act could be supplemented by the House and Senate bringing back committees or subcommittees devoted to exposing internal security problems, also known as un-American activities. A member of Congress exposed in the film for his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) , who is running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

146,"SYDNEY, Australia  —   A detention center in Papua New Guinea where Australia has sent hundreds of asylum seekers will be closed, the governments of both countries said Wednesday. But neither side said when it would be shut down or what would be done with the people held there. The center, on Manus Island, a rugged, volcanic outcrop, is one of two such detention centers that Australia maintains in the Pacific to house migrants it has intercepted on the way to its shores, a policy that rights groups and the United Nations have criticized. In April, Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court declared the center illegal, and the governments have held discussions since then about how to proceed. But few details about the future of the 960 asylum seekers being held there were disclosed Wednesday. “A series of options are being advanced,” Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, Peter O’Neill, said in a statement announcing that both governments had agreed to close the center. Australia’s minister for immigration and border protection, Peter Dutton, said the move would not change his country’s refusal to accept asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. “No one from Manus Island Regional Processing Center will ever be settled in Australia,” Mr. Dutton said in a statement. He has said in the past that asylum seekers granted refugee status could resettle in Papua New Guinea, though few have been allowed to do so, and that those denied asylum should be sent back to their home countries. Australia’s government, which has maintained a   policy toward asylum seekers to discourage migrants from trying the dangerous sea voyage, has said it is for Papua New Guinea to decide what to do with the asylum seekers at the Manus detention center. A senator in the Australian Greens Party, Sarah   said Wednesday that the asylum seekers should be resettled in Australia. “The government must ensure that these people are given a chance to rebuild their lives in safety in Australia,” Ms.   said in a statement. The conditions at the center, and at another on Nauru, a tiny island nation, have come under scrutiny. The United Nations has said that Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers at the offshore centers is cruel, inhuman and degrading, and that it violates international law. Detainees on Manus Island have contracted malaria and typhoid, and there have been reports of a lack of toilet paper and running water. Guards there have also been accused of brutality and of failing to protect detainees. Conditions at the detention center on Nauru have also been  described as harsh and dispiriting. The Guardian released documents this month from the Nauru center that detailed reports of child sexual abuse, assault and   among asylum seekers. About 1, 000 asylum seekers are living on Nauru. “Australia’s international reputation has been enormously damaged by the establishment of offshore camps,” said Tim O’Connor, acting chief executive of the Refugee Council of Australia, which represents 200 groups that support asylum seekers. “It has done enormous damage to the thousands of individuals who have been trapped in this system. The refugees should immediately be brought to Australia. ” Leaders of Australia’s governing parties and the main opposition Labor Party have said the country’s   policy has led to a steady decrease in the number of asylum seekers attempting to reach their shores, and the officials have shown few signs of wanting to change the policy.",0,575,25,23,0.38956521739130434,0,0,0,0,91.48757763975155,20.24074074074074,68.67701863354037,13.896030245746692,0.7339130434782609,0.008695652173913044,0.02434782608695652,0.03130434782608696,0.036521739130434785,0.008695652173913044,0.1391304347826087,0.010434782608695653,0,0.019130434782608695,0.08347826086956522,0,0.09913043478260869,0.006956521739130435,0,0.010434782608695653,0.0034782608695652175,0.059130434782608696,0,0.057391304347826085,0.0034782608695652175,0.04521739130434783,0,0,0.010434782608695653,0.017391304347826087,0.08521739130434783,0,0,0.0017391304347826088,0.0017391304347826088,0,0.006956521739130435,0.05565217391304348,0,0,0.44521739130434784,0.0034782608695652175,0.020869565217391306,0.0034782608695652175,0,0.050434782608695654,0.0034782608695652175,0.0017391304347826088,0.010434782608695653,0.01565217391304348,0.006956521739130435,0.0052173913043478265,0,0.017391304347826087,0.0052173913043478265,0.022608695652173914,0.0034782608695652175,0,0.01565217391304348,0.22260869565217392,0.0017391304347826088,0,0.022608695652173914,0.043478260869565216,0.04695652173913043,0.008695652173913044,0.01391304347826087,0.059130434782608696,0.1391304347826087,0.059130434782608696,0.01565217391304348,0,0.017391304347826087,0.16,0.0034782608695652175,0.0017391304347826088,0.01391304347826087,0.0034782608695652175,0,0,0.0017391304347826088,0.0034782608695652175,0.06434782608695652,0.11130434782608696,0,0.010434782608695653,0.0052173913043478265,0.03304347826086956,0.1356521739130435,0.1582608695652174,0,0.03304347826086956,0,3,0,88.775,1,4,4,1.2,32,1,61.775,0,6,10,0,3,1,24,5.2,144.775,171.975,24,,0.12271137864430522,0,0.8054155088977265,0.04454817121901355,0.1571856809867317,0.1571856809867317,0.052985722059125655,0.5987171296722147,0.04454817121901355,0.7422862556509829,0,0.2185982630593474,0.3179891830424227,0,0.6444515517494729,0.04454817121901355,0.034043760417036065,0.007376148090357814,0.2053618922656832,0.24394482073832405,-0.8884385234815535,0.756055179261676,42
147,"Matt Latimer, a former Bush speechwriter and contributing editor to Politico Magazine, predicts that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020. [From Politico Magazine:  Hillary Clinton will run for president. Again. No inside information informs this prediction. No argument is advanced as to whether her run is a good or a bad idea —  there are many ways to make a case either way. Instead this is just a statement of simple facts (if facts mean anything anymore, that is). And the facts are clear that the former secretary of state is doing everything she needs to do to run for the White House one more time. If she finds a path to do so, she will take it. And I can prove it.   …     Clinton is not going to want to spend the rest of her life haunted by the question of “what if. ” What if I could run again —  and win? Besides, seeking the White House has been her aspiration for decades. What else is there for her to do? Yes, barring some calamity, Clinton is running. And this brave columnist will go one step further. Not only will Clinton will run again, she has an excellent shot at getting the Democratic Party nomination again. But only if she approaches it quite differently. Here’s some advice for her.

Hearing his sweet rumble is so therapeutic and relaxing, if you listen to this you'll be falling asleep before you know it! She runs a program called Wildlife Education by Bernie which Max is a part of. He's an education animal ambassador who helps teach school children and the general public about the ongoing need to both protect and respect our planet and the endangered species who call it home. For centuries the Canada Lynx had endured and survived despite hunters who trap and kill them for their fur. In addition to hunting, an overall loss of habitat has led to their steady decline, so much so that in March of 2002 they were added to the endangered species list as threatened. Hopefully their population and numbers will rebound back to healthy levels. Until then, wildlife ambassadors like Max will continue to raise awareness and spread hope for the survival of all threatened and endangered species everywhere. Check out his beautiful face and listen to the sweet purring noises he makes, they'll definitely make you relax and feel at ease!

149,"The Minnesota officer who has been on trial for the murder in the shooting death of a black motorist has been found not guilty. The verdict was announced around 2:55 p. m. on Friday. [St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified during the trial that    Philando Castile had his hand on a gun.  A Facebook video live streamed by Diamond Reynolds, his girlfriend who was in the car, went viral. She narrated as Castile sat dying. Officer Yanez fatally shot Castile on July 6 after a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, a suburb in St. Paul, Minnesota. At the time, there was a question as to whether Castile was a suspect in a recent convenience store robbery. Officer Yanez faced charges of manslaughter and reckless discharge of a weapon. The Minnesota jury has been deliberating this week. Shortly after the shooting, Officer Yanez’ lawyer said, “I can tell you that the stop of the vehicle for an equipment violation was not the only reason for the stop. ” A handgun was recovered at the scene. During the Facebook live stream, Reynolds said, “police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason. ” Castile had a concealed handgun license. During Yanez’ trial, a police force expert testified that the officer was justified in his use of force. Expert Joe Dutton told jurors “When Yanez saw the   grip of Castile’s hand, he had to react to the actions of Mr. Castile,” reported the CBS affiliate in Minnesota. He added, “This truly was a   decision, there wasn’t time to do anything else. ” A firefighter testified that he heard Castile’s gun drop to the ground from his pocket when he put him on a stretcher. Officer Yanez took the stand in his defense. He testified that he stopped Castile’s car after Castile drove past him and gave him a “deer in the headlights” look that made him suspicious. “It’s a trigger,” he testified. The officer was already on alert after the convenience store robbery and Castile looked like one of the robbery suspects. He radioed his partner that he was going to pull the car over because “[t]he two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery,” Minnesota’s Star Tribune reported. He also had legal grounds to pull Castile over because he was driving with a broken brake light. Yanez walked up to the car, and he could smell burnt or burning marijuana, he testified. The officer told the jury he saw Castile’s hand on the gun and Castile did not follow his instructions not to reach for the gun. He told the jury, “I told him, ‘Don’t pull it out,” but when he saw Castile pull out the top of the gun, “That’s when I engaged Mr. Castile and shot him. ” The officer testified when he saw Castile’s gun, “my family popped into my head. My wife. My baby girl. ” “I did not want to shoot Mr. Castile at all. ” “Those were not my intentions. ” After the shooting, Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, reportedly told CNN, “I think he was just black in the wrong place. ” Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton further fanned the flame of racial tension when he asked at a press conference after the shooting  —   “Would this have happened if the driver and passenger were white?”  He answered his question saying  —   “I don’t think it would have,” reported Fox 9 News in  . Paul. As can be heard in the video, the officer told the girlfriend, “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand off of it. ” This occurs at the   mark in the video.

150,"It is called the SS-18, the “Satan” for short. As Obama has gutted military preparedness, Putin has busily been doing the opposite. The Russian military is capable of wiping our large swaths of this country in less than an afternoon.The title of this piece is 115 million Americans killed in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes is the approximate time that an SS-18, launched from inside Russia, would reach the Eastern Seaboard, where 5 of these missiles would destroy the entire east coast in which 115 million Americans would perish with scarcely a trace. The casualty figures come from Paul Craig Roberts.When will the bulk of Americans realize that they have been sold out under a treasonous chief executive? You will scarcely believe your eyes and ears in the following report as you are about to learn that we are Russia’s mercy.The stunning details are in the following video.DOES ANYONE THINK THAT HILLARY’S “NO-FLY ZONE” IN SYRIA, IS STILL A GOOD IDEA?

151,"90 Shares70 19 0 1Mohsen Abdelmoumen : According to you, when we see the numerous demonstrations anti-Trump in the United States after the election of Donald Trump at the presidency, are we witnessing a colored revolution?Wayne Madsen: It is classic Soros-funded color revolution. Soros is financing MoveOn.org, Black Lives Matter, Demos, and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators.In your very relevant books devoted to George Soros: “Soros: Quantum of Chaos”, you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world. From where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable?Soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person, Evelyn de Rothschild, along with his family. They are all the true puppet masters of the world.Soros remains a major element in the anti-Trump device. Can Trump resist him?MORE... Disrespecting the American Imperial Presidency Trump Won, Now What? Will America Survive the Next 4 Years? Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the Soros-Rothschild puppet masters and certainly not to Trump.Can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions?Secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the Sanhedrin and Pharisees in Palestine and the Dionysian cults of the Nile Valley and the Mediterranean region.In your book “ ISIS is US - The Shocking Truth Behind the Army of Terror”, you detail the relations between the USA and ISIS/Daesh. What is the triggering element that has put you on this trail?Trump's national security adviser retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn revealed that the US was supporting ISIS and then he was forced to resign. My own sources in the Middle East confirmed this long before Flynn made his public statement and was fired as Defense Intelligence Agency chief by Obama.You mention Western Sahara and the involvement of the Clintons in a deal with the Kingdom of Morocco while this case is under the authority of UN. Aren't the Clintons outlaws such Bonnie and Clyde by supporting Morocco against the Sahrawi people and the UN's resolutions?The Clintons received at least $12 million from the Moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to Morocco's agenda, which includes permanently annexing Western Sahara as the ""Southern Province."" Morocco and Israel share the same policy on annexing illegally-occupied territories.According to your diverse very interesting analysis, can we assert that the World Government or the false prophets of the New World Order are the real decision-makers of this world?I mentioned a few already, Soros/Rothschild. Others are the Bilderbergs, Bohemian Club, and the Council on Foreign Relations and their counterparts.You know very well some American intelligence agencies like the NSA. Do these intelligence agencies serve the US' interests or, rather, the oligarchy's interests?The CIA has always served the interests of Wall Street. NSA now serves the interests of the global security network it leads.You were an officer in the US Navy. Was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before?Before. I was an FBI-Navy whistleblower in 1982 and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the US Navy that reached into the Reagan-Bush White House and was ultimately exposed in The Washington Times in 1988-89. My whistleblowing cost me my Navy career, however, and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs.In the recent US election, we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls. Didn't one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes? Don't we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the New World Order and its purely capitalist product, globalization?99 percent of major newspapers endorsed Clinton. Many alternative news sources supported Trump. We are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate TV and websites to the alternative media, of which WayneMadsenReport.com has been prominent since its founding in 2005.Snowden has denounced the Prism program and you have denounced Echelon, both of which serve the interests of the world's oligarchic caste. What is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg?What is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between NSA and private companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and major telecommunications companies. It is much greater than even Snowden's documents describe.The quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings. How all these truths have been hidden?The major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events.I advise everyone to read the Wayne Madsen Report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media. How do you explain that we, who are resisting to what I call the fascist oligarchic caste, are called conspiracy theorists? Is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed?The term conspiracy theorist was developed by the CIA in the mid-1960s to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of President Kennedy. It has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into Iran-Contra, 9/11, and other deep state crimes.Your book “ The Star and The Sword ” is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the Zionist entity of Israel and Saudi Arabia. You claim that they organize false flag attacks, including the 9/11. What is the origin and nature of this Israeli-Saudi strategic alliance? Do you think that the JASTA law will succeed or will it be countered by the Zionist allies of Saudi Arabia? Do the fact that the USA and the Westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the Saudis to Yemen isn't due to the weight of the lobby Zionist?The Zionist-Wahhabi/Saudi alliance goes back to Ibn Saud who wrote the British and Zionist leaders that he did not oppose a Jewish homeland in Palestine so long as it did not lay claim to Saudi territory on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. The relationship has always been close, except for the time of King Faisal, who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative.Do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do? If so, how do you live it?I was forced to move my domicile from Washington because the outgoing Obama administration put pressure on some media organizations I did work for. These included RT (contributor agreement canceled) and Al Jazeera America (which is now defunct).The FBI entered my apartment in Washington at least twice and I've had three visits by them at my new home in Florida.I was informed of 3 personal threats in Washington.I ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press.Are you optimistic or do you think that the Satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos?As with cockroaches, which detest light, the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine. Light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so.Interview realized by Mohsen AbdelmoumenWho is Wayne Madsen?Wayne Madsen is an American journalist, television news commentator, online editor of Wayne Madsen Report.com , investigative journalist and author specializing intelligence and international affairs.

153,"Amid the controversy surrounding White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s alleged conversations with Russia, it may be instrumental to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign were accused of meeting with Hamas and Iran. [Depending on what took place, the alleged contacts with Iran may have violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in dispute with the United States. It may be questionable whether Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, legally qualifies as a foreign government.  In 2008, Robert Malley stepped down as an informal foreign policy adviser to Obama’s campaign when it was revealed that he met with Hamas members. Malley admitted to the meetings, but he claimed he met with the terrorists as part of his private job. “I have never hidden the fact that I had meetings with Hamas,” Malley wrote in an open letter published in the New York Times. “I do this as part of my job as Middle East program director at the International Crisis Group. ” He said he distanced himself from Obama’s campaign because the Hamas meetings were “becoming a distraction to me and to Senator Obama’s campaign, and to avoid any misperception  —   misrepresentation being the more accurate word  —   about the candidate’s position regarding the Islamist movement. ” Malley later joined the Obama administration. In 2015, he was appointed to lead the Middle East desk of the National Security Council. He was also named Obama’s special adviser regarding the Islamic State. Meanwhile, in August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U. S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a   to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his   involvement to him. Ledeen wrote: The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign. The Logan Act states: Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

154,"2016 presidential campaign by Matt Sedillo Hillary Clinton is, no doubt, a threat to life on Earth. But the duopoly electoral system is a menagerie of warmongers. “The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks.” Barack Obama has proven an awesomely prolific war maker. Bernie Sanders is no peacenik. “It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question.” LesserOfTwoEvilism by Matt Sedillo “ So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood.” The loathsome and shameless hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and the doctrine of lesseroftwoevilism has been laid bare this political season. This same Democratic Party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the left-leaning Bernie Sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an uber right wing candidate. Hillary Clinton at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into Donald Trump during her coronation come Election Day. Lesseroftwoevilism is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the Democratic Party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the American electorate. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party intend to use the platform of ""at least not being Donald Trump"" to install the most despised Democratic candidate in a generation into the White House. It is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the Republican primary. It is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process. “There is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton.” The country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of Donald Trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like “Make America Great Again” quickly followed by “Mexico Will Pay.” Much of the country is also polarized in the direction of Bernie Sanders. It was the political apparatus of the Democratic Party, not the Republicans, that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the American public. Setting aside the fact, for a moment, that we don't live in a democracy, it must be noted that lesseroftwoevilism in American politics is an ideology by Americans for Americans. Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, AND Bernie Sanders are all advocates of the US war machine. If any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage. Hillary Clinton is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices. When it comes to dropping bombs, obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton. Rainbow Coalition of Hawks Far beyond a “basket of deplorables,” the 2016 Republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most reactionary, bigoted elements of American political culture. Less than esteemed actor Scott Baio captured the mood when he proclaimed, “so of course let’s make America great again, but let’s make America America again.” That largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme. The Democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of peoples, ideas and movements. And indeed from the spontaneous chants of “black lives matter” to Tim Kaine leading a chant of “si se puede” to Eva Longoria reminding the audience “we didn’t cross the borders the borders crossed us” to Michelle Obama letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the White House and the country, from Sebastian De La Cruz singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the Khan family holding a copy of the Constitution, the Democratic National Convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the GOP was offering. The theme of inclusion ran high and, indeed, current president Barack Obama made his call for strength in unity, explicitly saying “And most of all I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe we are stronger together, black white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with different abilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big bold country that we love.” One flag to rule them all. “America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. ” General John Allen, standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of American might “Every American, in uniform or out, in the White House or at home, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation – all of us together pursuing our common values. “From the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we ARE the greatest country on this planet. “So we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America.” The message could not be clearer. Sorry Donald Trump, we are all Americans here. No apologies rest of the world, America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton: The Obliterator of Nations Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. So is John Kerry. So is Condoleezza Rice. So are Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. The secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent. Hillary Clinton is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason Donald Trump is known as a white nationalist. She is blatant and crass about it. “We came. We saw. He died” – Hillary Clinton on the assassination of Ghadaffi “In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them” – Hillary Clinton speaking of obliteration of 75 million Iranians. For much of the past few months the Clinton campaign have bemoaned a Russian conspiracy to reveal the words that Hillary Clinton actually wrote and thereby influence the American election. Hillary Clinton’s neo-Mcarthyite cold war against her own words and general war talk on Russia should come as no surprise to anyone paying any attention. She was hawkish on Russia in their land dispute with Georgia over Ossetia, even going so far as to arm the Georgian government in 2010 less than two years after the conflict. She was warlike on the conflict in the Ukraine, promising Ukrainian government officials as recent as September of this year to stand with them against “Russian aggression.” “A Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class.” This is the talk of someone prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. It should be mentioned, however, that Obama has also dialed up his anti Russian rhetoric, as has Tim Kaine, as has Mike Pence. It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question. Ultimately a Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class. If she wants war it is a reflection of their desire for war. If they want the bombs to fall then death will rain from the sky. So long as they hold power they shall exercise it. So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood, because there truly is no alternative. Because ultimately, this is about Clinton and then again it isn’t. And this is about the Democrats and then again it isn’t. This is about the US and this is about war. Hillary Clinton is a 2016 warlord. War is a racket. And so is this God damn election.

155,"Another powerful earthquake strikes central Italy Please scroll down for video Initial reports on the magnitude of the tremors varied – while USGS and Italian media first talked of a 7.1 earthquake, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC) said the tremor was magnitude 6.5 or 6.6. Italy Civil Protection reports buildings collapsing in a number of locations following Sunday's tremors. They did not provide any information regarding casualties. Local RAI TV reports that the tremor was powerful enough to wake the residents of the capital Rome, who reported walls of buildings shaking. While according to RAI Radio, at least two buildings collapsed in Norcia - the Basilica di San Benedetto and the Cathedral of Santa Maria Argentea. BEFORE AFTER Local media also reported destruction at the Church of Saint Augustine in Amatrice, which lost its bell tower . According to the mayor of Ussita, a commune in the Marche district with around 450 inhabitants, 90 percent of the buildings in the area were brought down by the quake. Emergency services across the region are currently checking the destroyed buildings for casualties, civil protection authorities said. Aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.5 still reportedly rock the area. The USGS says the quake was centered 6 km (3.7 miles) north of Norcia, a town in the province of Perugia. The epicenter lay some 10 kilometers deep. Norcia is home to some 5,000 people. Italians who live in the areas affected by the quake rushed to the web, posting videos of shaking furniture inside their homes. Italy's National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks (CGR) cautioned Friday that more powerful earthquakes could hit the region in the nearest future, identifying at least three areas at risk for further seismic activity. ""There is no current evidence that the (seismic) sequence underway is coming to an end,"" the commission warned. This week's quakes come mere two months after almost 300 people were killed in the region by a quake that levelled several small towns ( via rt.com ).

156,"I grew up in San Francisco, land of organic vegetables and vegan delights, before such things were so popular. From an early age, my parents sent me to school with     sandwiches,   eggs, and fresh fruit from the fields of the Central Valley. Although I had every opportunity to eat delicious and nutritious food, I never met a vegetable I liked. Every time I tried something green, I spit it out or threw it up. I was a theatrical kid: taking off all my clothes when I didn’t want to leave a friend’s house, throwing myself against walls screaming “Aya not tired! Aya happy! Aya bouncing off the walls!” when I didn’t want to go to bed. I was just as melodramatic with food, gagging loudly when I accidentally ran into a zucchini in a quiche, picking mushrooms out of pasta dishes and piling them on the side of my plate like dams, throwing out a perfectly good tuna melt if there were slivers of celery inside. What I could keep down was junk food. Lots and lots of junk food. My parents tried their best, but the only times I was truly happy were the two days a week I ate fast food for dinner, one day with my mom at McDonald’s and the other with my dad at Wendy’s. My parents were divorced I spent exactly half the week with each of them, alternating every Saturday. Neither parent knew about the other’s weekly convenience meal. Like most children of divorce, the only power I had was to keep their secrets and then exploit them when it suited my needs. I kept these   visits confidential, allowing both parents to think they were treating me to something special. I would sit in the car, beatifically chewing, fondling a Hamburglar toy or cheap movie   that had come with the food. By the time I got to middle school, I was a   sugar addict, using every dime of my weekly “lunch money” to buy candy at the Cala Foods in the Castro. I hid Skor bars and Skittles around my room like Claudia in “The   Club. ” I once woke up covered in melted chocolate from a forgotten stash in my pillowcase. In high school, I realized I needed more than just sugar to live, so every day I would buy and consume an entire bag of Goldfish (that elusive pizza flavor really is the best). Who needed multiple food groups? Artificial flavors? Count me in. Butylated hydroxyanisole? Yum! It wasn’t until I was 22 and newly graduated from college that I voluntarily chose to put a piece of lettuce in my mouth, then actually chewed and swallowed it. I was doing “The Winter’s Tale” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at the Great River Shakespeare Festival, playing Perdita and Hermia  —   two characters whose names, in retrospect, sound like leafy greens. I was a working actor making $250 a week, more money than I had ever seen, and I felt like a real adult. But adults cooked and had wine with dinner. When I was invited for meals at other company members’ small apartments, I didn’t want to embarrass them by refusing their food, or embarrass myself by smuggling in a box of Mike and Ikes and a bag of  . One night, someone made a salad. Just a salad. I stared at the plate  —   lettuce, onions, tomatoes  —   you know, salad. To me, that pile of fresh food was like a challenge out of “Fear Factor. ” For years, I had been telling everyone that I didn’t eat vegetables. I believed I hated them. I even took pride in the fact that I could fill my body with junk and not gain weight. I secretly, ridiculously, bizarrely thought my   stance made me intriguing. Unique. Idiosyncratic. But sometimes we tell stories about ourselves that aren’t true. Sometimes stories we think are fixed are actually flexible. I picked up a piece of   lettuce and ate it. I didn’t gag. To my surprise, I didn’t even dislike it. Tentatively, I began to try other vegetables, not just that night, but every time they were put in front of me. That Christmas, out for dinner with my mother, I lifted a fork of spinach to my mouth. She was so excited that she took a picture of it and made it her screen saver. Surprisingly, I found that I loved lots of vegetables and consequently, all kinds of foods. Broccolini was somehow less intimidating than the larger version: the gateway, broccoli. Zucchini wasn’t so bad after all. I realized that I had determined a defining characteristic based on who I was at 6. I had not tried again for 16 years. What else had I decided about myself that might not be true anymore? What had I decided about other people? That piece of lettuce was my first recognition that my identity was not set, but malleable. I used to think belly button piercings were cool. I used to date men who didn’t like me. I used to smoke. I had never wanted to get married I thought it wasn’t “who I was. ” But a few years ago, I found myself feeling otherwise. This didn’t mean I was a different person. But the narrative I had about myself had changed. Would I have learned this in other ways? Probably. But that bite opened me up to the possibility that change can happen even when you’re not trying you just have to stay curious. I’m still a picky eater. I don’t like pork chops,   chicken, mushrooms and celery. But now, I will at least try pretty much anything. I still love the occasional Taco Bell (two bean burritos, no red sauce, no onions) and, of course, an    burger. Yet my world is so much bigger because of that tiny piece of lettuce.",0,991,13.95774647887324,71,0.23208879919273462,0,0,0,0,58.16328827580089,91.30328687352842,14.006421429226679,65.90873416302276,0.8829465186680121,0.016145307769929364,0.04036326942482341,0.04339051463168517,0.04339051463168517,0.016145307769929364,0.17356205852674067,0.0030272452068617556,0.004036326942482341,0.022199798183652877,0.056508577194752774,0.0010090817356205853,0.07063572149344097,0.06559031281533804,0.006054490413723511,0.017154389505549948,0.020181634712411706,0.14530776992936428,0.0020181634712411706,0.056508577194752774,0.025227043390514632,0.054490413723511606,0,0,0.05247225025227043,0.013118062563067608,0.06357214934409687,0.004036326942482341,0.011099899091826439,0.005045408678102927,0.005045408678102927,0,0.004036326942482341,0.09283551967709384,0.0020181634712411706,0.0020181634712411706,0.5176589303733602,0.0030272452068617556,0.0030272452068617556,0.006054490413723511,0.10191725529767912,0.05247225025227043,0.0010090817356205853,0.054490413723511606,0.02320887991927346,0.014127144298688193,0.011099899091826439,0.0020181634712411706,0.007063572149344097,0.017154389505549948,0.025227043390514632,0.011099899091826439,0,0,0.012108980827447022,0.2472250252270434,0.004036326942482341,0.0020181634712411706,0.02119071644803229,0.06256306760847628,0.035317860746720484,0.12108980827447023,0.03229061553985873,0.02119071644803229,0.1301715438950555,0.17356205852674067,0.029263370332996974,0.006054490413723511,0.014127144298688193,0.1301715438950555,0.0010090817356205853,0.013118062563067608,0.004036326942482341,0,0.006054490413723511,0,0,0.0030272452068617556,0.06559031281533804,0.0615539858728557,0,0.024217961654894045,0.010090817356205853,0.05348133198789102,0.136226034308779,0.15237134207870837,0.0030272452068617556,0.010090817356205853,0.0030272452068617556,44.5,0,21.5,0,1,20,9.73,26.5,25.255000000000003,15.73,6,53.66,24.725,0,44.5,20,137.14,53.730000000000004,82.46000000000001,268.6,137.14,,0.5414752563211196,0,0.3632806873410819,0,0.02585122435717656,0.34672328162418714,0.20521846572093064,0.41288264035540073,0.4012686325870184,0.29449821525554626,0.13735355793135928,0.5874567965741104,0.39618389669644144,0,0.20521846572093064,0.34672328162418714,0.11606296547054841,0.04547224102911308,0.06978672985781992,0.22731888964116456,0.6723571494412647,0.7726811103588355,78
157,"Trump Adviser Says Israeli Settlements ‘Not Illegal’ Contrary to Trump camp's statements, Israeli settlements are a violation of international law, | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Marc Zell, co-chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel speaks as the Republican Party launches its first ever election campaign in Israel in Modiin, Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. Donald Trump’s adviser on Israel said on Wednesday that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are not illegal, adding that he believes the candidate agrees with him, putting the pair at odds with much of the world. Speaking to AFP at a rooftop restaurant on Jerusalem’s Mount Zion after a pro-Trump rally, David Friedman also said the US presidential candidate was “tremendously sceptical” about the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. About 150 people, including right-wing Israelis and evangelical Christians, attended Wednesday’s Trump rally outside the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, near the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound. The compound is holy to both Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. Located in East Jerusalem, it was occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community. Asked whether Trump viewed the West Bank as part of Israel, as many far-right Israelis do, Friedman did not answer directly. “I don’t think he believes that the settlements are illegal,” Friedman said.

The US has intensified criticism of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank in recent months, warning that it is eating away at hopes for a two-state solution. Settlements in the West Bank are viewed as illegal under international law and are major stumbling blocks to peace efforts because they are built on land seized in the 1967 war which Palestinians see as part of their future state. At an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March, Trump described an “unbreakable bond” between the US and Israel. “When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,” Trump told delegates, in a speech that heaped praise on Israel and derided Palestinians as perpetrators of violence. Recalling rounds of failed peace talks between the two parties, Trump blamed Palestinian leaders. “To make a great deal, you need two willing participants,” Trump said. “We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years.” Friedman reiterated that Trump would recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the US embassy there – which would break with decades of precedent and put Washington at odds with most UN member states. There were chants of “lock her up” when Trump’s Democrat rival Hillary Clinton’s name was mentioned at the rally ahead of the 8 November vote – a common refrain among Trump supporters who want to see her jailed over an emails scandal. “I hate Hillary. She’s the same like (Barack) Obama,” said Ran Hofman, 54, who waved an Israeli flag. “They screw up the whole world.” A brief video message from Trump of about one minute was played at the event. “Together we will stand up to the enemies like Iran, bent on destroying Israel and her people,” Trump said. “Together we will make America and Israel safe again.”",1,617,22.035714285714285,28,0.33063209076175043,0,0,0.0032414910858995136,0,97.31991455954132,41.90445912812201,80.92229425535746,28.467909238249597,0.7374392220421394,0.014586709886547812,0.03565640194489465,0.019448946515397084,0.04376012965964344,0.029173419773095625,0.19448946515397084,0.014586709886547812,0,0.019448946515397084,0.08103727714748785,0,0.04862236628849271,0.004862236628849271,0,0.009724473257698542,0.006482982171799027,0.05348460291734198,0,0.055105348460291734,0.027552674230145867,0.04051863857374392,0.014586709886547812,0.0016207455429497568,0.008103727714748784,0.008103727714748784,0.08265802269043761,0.0016207455429497568,0,0,0.006482982171799027,0,0.011345218800648298,0.03565640194489465,0,0,0.39384116693679094,0,0.01620745542949757,0,0.006482982171799027,0.02593192868719611,0.006482982171799027,0.0032414910858995136,0.02106969205834684,0.012965964343598054,0.009724473257698542,0.004862236628849271,0.006482982171799027,0.014586709886547812,0.009724473257698542,0.019448946515397084,0.004862236628849271,0,0.03241491085899514,0.20907617504051865,0.014586709886547812,0.0032414910858995136,0.024311183144246355,0.04862236628849271,0.06482982171799027,0.03727714748784441,0.02106969205834684,0.029173419773095625,0.1620745542949757,0.06320907617504051,0.014586709886547812,0,0.03727714748784441,0.18152350081037277,0.019448946515397084,0.008103727714748784,0.006482982171799027,0.0016207455429497568,0.008103727714748784,0,0.0016207455429497568,0.011345218800648298,0.09886547811993517,0.1085899513776337,0.0016207455429497568,0.004862236628849271,0.004862236628849271,0.05672609400324149,0.10696920583468396,0.11021069692058347,0.012965964343598054,0.03403565640194489,0.0016207455429497568,13,0,83.48,1,28,0,5,29,2.83,26,10,14,28.46,0,13,0,77.11999999999999,5,105.48,186.6,77.11999999999999,,0.35456815529713565,0,0.7791360351718096,0.04054439916350351,0.541960108450192,0,0.1744328890878361,0.5506574560869912,0.10681535108933396,0.523514677221034,0.2970504159217058,0.3717045820153256,0.5460023358331094,0,0.2970504159217058,0,0.10179514255543821,0.006599788806758183,0.13922914466737066,0.2463041182682154,-0.6289196523254941,0.7536958817317846,46
158,"All the worries over Serena Williams’s right shoulder and concerns about her difficult   opponent seemed to vanish in a little over an hour Tuesday, as Williams let the rest of the women’s field know that despite the alarms, she is in very good form. The   Williams opened her 2016 United States Open campaign with a smooth     win over No. 29 Ekaterina Makarova and moved a step closer to the title that eluded her a year ago. Also on Tuesday night,   Andy Murray defeated Lukas Rosol,      . Williams’s previous match at the U. S. Open was her surprising semifinal loss to Roberta Vinci in 2015, which prevented Williams from winning the Grand Slam. “I had a great experience last year,” she said. “I was going for something that no one has done in a really long time. Yeah, it didn’t end up wonderful for me or the way I wanted it to end. But it was all I could do. If I could make the semis this year, I’d be excited about that. I need to at least do something. ” This year Williams is seeking her 23rd title in a major tournament, which would move her past Steffi Graf for the most in the Open era. She is also in pursuit of a record seventh U. S. Open title, which would break a tie with Chris Evert. The smiles and hugs that were exchanged by members of her support team after the match, including her coach Patrick Mouratoglou, suggest Williams is ready for the challenge. Wearing compression sleeves on both arms, Williams moved well across the court. Her serve was more than strong enough to dismiss most of the concerns about the shoulder injury that prompted her to withdraw from the Western  Southern Open in Cincinnati this month. Williams said the key, though, would be how she felt Wednesday. Her average   speed was 108 miles per hour, and she touched 121 m. p. h. on her fastest delivery. She served 12 aces, eight in the first set, to overwhelm Makarova in 62 minutes. Makarova beat Williams at the Australian Open in 2012, but there was little to resemble that match on Tuesday, which was a good day over all for the Williams family. Before Serena Williams took the court, her sister Venus, seeded sixth, defeated Kateryna Kozlova of Ukraine,       to improve her record in the   of the Open to  . Venus Williams said she knew nothing about her opponent before the match. She said mistakes led to her dropping the second set. “I definitely had a lot more errors than I wanted,” she said. “If I could cut those in half, it’s definitely a different story. ” She made 63 unforced errors to 39 for Kozlova. Venus Williams was playing in the main draw of a record 72nd Grand Slam event, breaking a tie with Amy Frazier for the most in the Open era. She reflected back on her first final here, in 1997, which she lost to Martina Hingis, and wondered if her younger sister could have won. Perhaps Serena could have. But the more pertinent question today is whether Serena Williams can win a match a week from Saturday, when the final is scheduled, even if her shoulder is sore. “I wouldn’t bet against her,” Venus Williams said. “Honestly, I wouldn’t want to do that. ”",0,561,14.763157894736842,38,0.26024955436720143,0,0,0,0,87.28412923611003,15.043686161333222,59.14916221033868,72.492394533571,0.7950089126559715,0.024955436720142603,0.049910873440285206,0.0338680926916221,0.06060606060606061,0.0106951871657754,0.1657754010695187,0,0.0053475935828877,0.0142602495543672,0.08912655971479501,0.0017825311942959,0.0748663101604278,0.012477718360071301,0.0106951871657754,0.0071301247771836,0.0106951871657754,0.10160427807486631,0,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0.035650623885918005,0,0,0.030303030303030304,0.0338680926916221,0.06417112299465241,0,0.0053475935828877,0.0053475935828877,0.062388591800356503,0,0.0017825311942959,0.062388591800356503,0,0,0.483065953654189,0.0035650623885918,0.0106951871657754,0.0017825311942959,0.023172905525846704,0.040998217468805706,0.0071301247771836,0,0.012477718360071301,0.0142602495543672,0.0071301247771836,0,0.0035650623885918,0.0142602495543672,0.0106951871657754,0.017825311942959002,0.0035650623885918,0.0017825311942959,0.0374331550802139,0.24598930481283424,0,0,0.017825311942959002,0.06951871657754011,0.0142602495543672,0.08377896613190731,0.0427807486631016,0.024955436720142603,0.1408199643493761,0.12477718360071301,0.023172905525846704,0,0.0213903743315508,0.17290552584670232,0,0.017825311942959002,0.0071301247771836,0.0053475935828877,0,0,0,0.0570409982174688,0.08377896613190731,0.08912655971479501,0,0.0285204991087344,0,0.07130124777183601,0.12299465240641712,0.1354723707664884,0,0.0053475935828877,0.0035650623885918,29.25,0,33.375,0,3.84375,5,8,8,25,28.7,8.25,22,19,9,29.25,10,83.09375,25,86.075,193.16875,83.09375,,0.5148007639264568,0,0.5476420032262163,0,0.12236625048840107,0.15352447281755405,0.2249206609675913,0.2249206609675913,0.4755736118852673,0.5100581194853394,0.23033049142370324,0.44383385902887595,0.4080046430562116,0.24611616721299556,0.43238259431908876,0.2661832955178855,0.1185074919553959,0.03565475500726466,0.1227593214900122,0.27549537825238213,-0.13264833804467605,0.7245046217476179,53
159,"Sam Moore, of legendary soul and RB duo Sam  Dave, has been announced as a performer at the “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration” on January 19 in Washington, D. C.[“I was a participant in the civil rights movement and have seen many positive changes and advancement in my 81 years of living in this wonderful country, but I know we must all join hands and work together with our new President,” the Grammy   singer said in a press release. “I honestly believe that if we can accomplish this, the best is yet to come. ”  Moore stressed the importance of all Americans rallying behind Trump. “We all as Americans need to unite behind our new President and give him a chance,” he said. “He needs everyone’s support to make America greater, stronger and an even better country. ” Moore joins a   list of inaugural performers, including The Beach Boys, country music stars Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith, and rock band Three Doors Down. Broadway singer Jennifer Holliday and renowned opera singer Andrea Bocelli backed out of singing at inauguration events after facing fierce backlash. Moore said he won’t be bullied by protesters because performing at Trump’s inauguration is the “right thing to do. ” “I am not going to let them, the left side, intimidate me from doing what I feel is the right thing to do for the country and that [presidential] seal,” Moore said, according to the Associated Press. “Give the man a shot. He hasn’t even said ‘I do’ yet. Give him a chance. If you don’t like him after four years, then don’t vote for him next time. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0,283,17.6875,16,0.26855123674911663,0,0,0,0,82.67060148332233,21.443220397699708,76.02162972480994,86.7996620064526,0.7879858657243817,0.024734982332155476,0.04946996466431095,0.0176678445229682,0.04946996466431095,0.038869257950530034,0.21201413427561838,0.0035335689045936395,0.0035335689045936395,0.024734982332155476,0.0706713780918728,0,0.0706713780918728,0.007067137809187279,0.0035335689045936395,0.014134275618374558,0.02120141342756184,0.07773851590106007,0,0.05653710247349823,0.028268551236749116,0.06007067137809187,0,0,0.0176678445229682,0.0176678445229682,0.08480565371024736,0.0035335689045936395,0,0.014134275618374558,0,0,0.01060070671378092,0.03180212014134275,0,0,0.45229681978798586,0.0035335689045936395,0.028268551236749116,0.0035335689045936395,0.028268551236749116,0.028268551236749116,0.0035335689045936395,0,0.01060070671378092,0.0035335689045936395,0.03180212014134275,0.0353356890459364,0,0.02120141342756184,0.0176678445229682,0.007067137809187279,0.0035335689045936395,0,0.014134275618374558,0.2332155477031802,0.014134275618374558,0,0.045936395759717315,0.053003533568904596,0.0706713780918728,0.0812720848056537,0.04240282685512368,0.02120141342756184,0.127208480565371,0.10954063604240283,0.014134275618374558,0,0.06007067137809187,0.1519434628975265,0.0035335689045936395,0.0176678445229682,0,0,0.0035335689045936395,0,0,0.028268551236749116,0.11307420494699646,0.08480565371024736,0,0.014134275618374558,0.0035335689045936395,0.045936395759717315,0.14487632508833923,0.1519434628975265,0.0176678445229682,0.03180212014134275,0.0035335689045936395,30.46,0,13,0,2.73,8,3,0,0,5,4.73,11,18.73,0,30.46,2,56.19,13,16.73,79.19,56.19,,0.6300086330087337,0,0.4208680109932326,0,0.13240508271743812,0.3090169943749474,0.14361939376204164,0,0,0.21844989525420877,0.2091204472596482,0.38077377899488185,0.5114894817245864,0,0.08818187607973792,0.10056040392403998,0.16713763050655878,0.03866861001219549,0.04976352657723311,0.23555132514352004,0.7572572150022396,0.7644486748564799,26
160,"Comments Famed actor and funnyman Will Ferrell returned to Comedy Central to reprise his caricature of despised President George W. Bush to hilarious effect. “First of all, I’d like to say something about my cousin Billy Bush. He’s been in the news a lot lately. Him and that disgraced pumpkin, Donald Trump, talking on the bus. I just want to say ONE thing, we Bushes don’t act like that, okay? We have standards, and we’re raised certain way. We would never, under any circumstances, ride a bus. When you’re a Bush, you ride in a limousine or a jump jet, or maybe a monster truck called Sasquatch Express. Never a bus.” Ferrell then goes on point out that somehow, the utterly abhorrent character of Republican   has whitewashed Bush’s less viscerally appalling but equally reprehensible legacy. “This dunderhead is making me look great. I destabilized an entire region [Iraq], but no one seems to care anymore thanks to the Bozo Trump here. Folks forgotten how I tanked the economy or how I didn’t get Bin Laden.” Nobody should forget how the Great Recession was engineered and executed under the watch of George W.

161,"According to the Associated Press, Chinese diplomats “say they aren’t overly worried by fiery rhetoric from Trump and his Cabinet picks, and that China won’t change its basic approach” to issues like the South China Sea. [“Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Thursday that tensions in the strategically vital waterway have lessened and countries from outside the region should support efforts toward stability,” the AP reports.  Kang was speaking in response to Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson’s assertion that the U. S. should send a “clear signal” to China about halting its military buildup on South China Sea islands. The New York Times worries that Tillerson’s remarks could “foreshadow” a foreign policy crisis with China: Mr. Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that China’s     campaign in the    rich sea was illegal and “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea. ” “We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops,” Mr. Tillerson told the senators. “And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed. ” Should those words be translated into action after Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, it would be a remarkable change in the American approach to Beijing’s   in the South China Sea, which is transforming the area into what one Washington think tank said would by 2030 become “virtually a Chinese lake. ” China asserts sovereignty over most of the South China Sea despite competing claims by countries including Vietnam and the Philippines and an international ruling rejecting most of Beijing’s assertions. The Secretary of State nominee explained his focus on the South China Sea, as related by Reuters: Tillerson said he considered China’s South China Sea activity “extremely worrisome” and that it would be a threat to the “entire global economy” if Beijing were able to dictate access to the waterway. He blamed the current situation on what he termed an inadequate U. S. response. “The failure of a response has allowed them just to keep pushing the envelope on this,” Tillerson said. “The way we’ve got to deal with this is we’ve got to show back up in the region with our traditional allies in Southeast Asia,” he said. “They’re taking territory or control, or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully China’s,” he added, stressing that China’s   and declaration of an air defense zone in contested waters are “illegal actions. ” If Tillerson is serious about denying China access to the islands, it certainly would be a dramatic change from the Obama policy of “challenging” China’s “excessive maritime claims” without doing anything to actually slow them down. The Times reports Tillerson’s remarks generated “reactions including confusion, disbelief, and warlike threats from analysts in China,” quoting one such analyst boasting that China now has greater   capability than the United States, and would be ready for any “troubles” sent its way. Just about every Western media report on Tillerson’s statement focuses on the ominous ambiguity of what he meant by denying China “access” to South China Sea islands  —   many of which, as Reuters points out, are “equipped with   airstrips and fortified with weapons. ” “This is the sort of    remark akin to a tweet that pours fuel on the fire and maybe makes things worse. Short of going to war with China, there is nothing the Americans can do,” senior analyst Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute told Bloomberg News. However, Bloomberg notes that for all the concern about an enraged Chinese response, and a bit of snarling from analysts like those cited and alluded to by the New York Times, the actual official response from Beijing has been “relatively measured” so far  —   consisting mostly of officials like the Foreign Ministry’s Lu Kang saying they aren’t quite certain what Tillerson meant.",0,651,26.04,25,0.3533026113671275,0,0,0,0,94.44641942798624,9.2904961510757,66.09809084924292,7.816209082451699,0.7419354838709677,0.015360983102918587,0.030721966205837174,0.029185867895545316,0.039938556067588324,0.013824884792626729,0.1889400921658986,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.030721966205837174,0.08141321044546851,0,0.06605222734254992,0.0015360983102918587,0,0.02457757296466974,0.013824884792626729,0.11213517665130568,0.0030721966205837174,0.041474654377880185,0.016897081413210446,0.03686635944700461,0,0.0015360983102918587,0.019969278033794162,0.018433179723502304,0.10138248847926268,0,0,0.0030721966205837174,0,0,0.007680491551459293,0.03379416282642089,0,0,0.43317972350230416,0.0015360983102918587,0.019969278033794162,0,0,0.04915514592933948,0.0030721966205837174,0,0.021505376344086023,0.009216589861751152,0.0015360983102918587,0.015360983102918587,0.0030721966205837174,0.02304147465437788,0.010752688172043012,0.027649769585253458,0.0030721966205837174,0,0.009216589861751152,0.1827956989247312,0.004608294930875576,0,0.027649769585253458,0.041474654377880185,0.0445468509984639,0.029185867895545316,0.01228878648233487,0.04915514592933948,0.15360983102918588,0.07834101382488479,0.013824884792626729,0,0.06758832565284179,0.11981566820276497,0.0030721966205837174,0.016897081413210446,0.013824884792626729,0.004608294930875576,0.004608294930875576,0,0,0.01228878648233487,0.06144393241167435,0.07680491551459294,0,0.02457757296466974,0.006144393241167435,0.02304147465437788,0.10138248847926268,0.11827956989247312,0.006144393241167435,0.03686635944700461,0.004608294930875576,13,0,65.7,0,5,11,0,14,12,97.55,10,0,3,0,13,0,39,11,143.6,186.6,39,,0.3676399911630594,0,0.7460764573685869,0,0.1827439976315568,0.3297294921503347,0,0.3850313054275347,0.34923639691004144,0.8135221998828144,0.3090169943749474,0,0.1182933591140401,0,0.538104404256966,0,0.04939209726443769,0.01393110435663627,0.1818642350557244,0.236322188449848,-0.8686885972833572,0.763677811550152,48
162,"HONG KONG  —   A   billionaire who has forged financial ties with some of the country’s most powerful families was taken by the Chinese police from his apartment at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong late last week and spirited across the border, a person close to the businessman said on Tuesday. The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, who has been missing since Friday, is in police custody in China, where he apparently is safe, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. Mr. Xiao is a Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, though he was born in China. His removal from Hong Kong appears to contravene the “one country, two systems” rule that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs and bars the Chinese police from operating here. When asked on Tuesday about Mr. Xiao, the Hong Kong police issued a statement saying that “the subject” had entered mainland China through a border crossing on Friday. His disappearance was reported the following day, but on Sunday one of Mr. Xiao’s family members reported that Mr. Xiao was safe and that the family had asked to withdraw the missing person’s filing. Mr. Xiao, 45, had spent years outside China, most recently staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. The situation is eerily reminiscent of the case of another   holder, the bookseller Lee Bo, who disappeared off the streets of Hong Kong in late 2015, only to turn up days later in Chinese custody. His case, as well as the disappearance of four of his business associates, made headlines around the world and shook many people in Hong Kong, who saw his abduction as a violation of the city state’s ability to run its own affairs, guaranteed by international treaty until 2047. Mr. Xiao, a prodigy who passed the examination to enter the elite Peking University at age 14, controls a sprawling empire with shares in banks, insurance companies, coal, cement and property through his Tomorrow Group. The Hurun Report, which tracks Chinese billionaires, estimated his fortune last year at 40 billion renminbi, or $5. 8 billion. But that vastly understates his wealth, said the person close to Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao’s fortunes rose after his graduation from the university in 1990, where he had been head of the official student organization and stayed loyal to the government during the   demonstrations in 1989. In recent years, Mr. Xiao has acted as a kind of banker to the ruling class, paying $2. 4 million in 2013 to buy shares in an investment firm held by the sister and    of China’s president, Xi Jinping. A company he helped to control financed a deal that benefited the    of a top former leader, Jia Qinglin, The New York Times reported in 2014. Mr. Xiao bought the shares from Mr. Xi’s relatives to help them divest financial holdings following a 2012 report by Bloomberg News that detailed his relatives’ wealth. He did it “for the family,” Mr. Xiao’s spokeswoman said in 2014. His fate in recent days has been the focus of media attention and confusion in Hong Kong and in the overseas   press after reports emerged that he had been arrested. On Tuesday, Mr. Xiao posted two notices on his company’s WeChat account saying he had not been taken from Hong Kong to the mainland and instead was “recuperating abroad” and soon would meet with media organizations. In Chinese, there is no ambiguity: “Abroad” means outside the mainland. Those posts have since been removed. Those statements were untrue, according to the person close to Mr. Xiao, and were meant to tamp down interest in the story, because China’s government did not want it publicized. The person did not know why Mr. Xiao had been taken to the mainland, adding that his relatives, including his wife and son, were not in China. The Tomorrow Group has extensive holdings in China. Previous disappearances of Chinese billionaires have generated turmoil in Chinese stock markets, which are closed this week for the Lunar New Year. On Tuesday evening, the Hong Kong police press office would not comment on whether the local police had helped arrest Mr. Xiao and transport him across the border, and it would not say whether the Chinese police had illegally apprehended Mr. Xiao, saying only that it had asked the mainland police for help in the case.

164,"President Trump, who flew across the country on hundreds of nights during the 2016 campaign to sleep in his own bed, has now spent five straight days in the unfamiliar surroundings of the White House. His aides said privately that he seemed apprehensive about the move to his new home, but Mr. Trump has discovered there is a lot he likes. “These are the most beautiful phones I’ve ever used in my life,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening. “The world’s most secure system,” he added, laughing. “The words just explode in the air. ” What he meant was that no one was listening in and recording his words. The president sat at his desk  —   the one used by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, among others  —   at the end of his fourth full day in office. His mornings, he said, are spent as they were in Trump Tower. He rises before 6 a. m. watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence, and later in a small dining room in the West Wing, and looks through the morning newspapers: The New York Times, The New York Post and now The Washington Post. But his meetings now begin at 9 a. m. earlier than they used to, which significantly curtails his television time. Still, Mr. Trump, who does not read books, is able to end his evenings with plenty of television. In between, Mr. Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office and has meetings in the West Wing. “They have a lot of board rooms,” he said of the White House, an apparent reference to the Cabinet Room and the Roosevelt Room. The White House is the only property that Mr. Trump has slept in that is more famous than one of his own, and he seems in awe. Although he made his name building extravagant, gilded properties, the new president has marveled to aides about the splendor of the White House and the lengths he must walk to retrieve something from a   room. His preference during the day is to work in the Oval Office. And to stare at it, still. So do his staff members and relatives. “I’ve had people come in they walk in here and they just want to stare for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump said. Among modern American presidents, Mr. Trump may be best situated to work where he lives. For decades, he has lived in a penthouse apartment on the 58th floor of Trump Tower and taken an elevator down to the 26th floor, where he has a corner office with views of Central Park. Many presidents have complained of being cooped up inside the White House  —   George W. Bush in particular said he missed the outdoors  —   but Mr. Trump can go for days without breathing in fresh outside air. Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their    son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television  —   and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides  —   to keep him company. That was the case after 9 p. m. on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to Bill O’Reilly’s show on Fox News, which was airing a feature on crime in Chicago. At 9:25 p. m. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter: In the interview, Mr. Trump demurred when asked about whether it was hard having his family away from him, and he pointed to Thursday, when Mrs. Trump and Barron, who is finishing the school year in New York, are expected to return. “They’ll come down on weekends,” Mr. Trump said. “She’ll come down on Thursdays and stay. ” He said he was enjoying himself so far, despite his visible displeasure with the coverage of his inauguration and the first performance of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, who shouted at the news media and made numerous false statements about Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowds in the White House briefing room on Saturday. Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, watched Mr. Spicer’s   on Monday while eating lunch in the West Wing dining room, where the president murmured approval of Mr. Spicer’s Monday performance and called his press secretary a “superstar. ” His first breakfast at the White House was Saturday morning  —   a buffet in the residence spread with fresh fruit, pastries and other treats  —   where his adult children and their families joined him. The kitchen has been stocked with the same types of snacks that Mr. Trump had on his private plane, including Lay’s potato chips. His oldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser, stayed with him in the White House through Sunday. They left for their own new home at the end of the weekend to get their children ready for their new schools. Mr. Trump has not brought along any household staff from Trump Tower, an aide said. The president spent a part of Tuesday poring over artwork from the White House collections, settling on a portrait of Andrew Jackson  —   America’s first populist president, who has been invoked by Mr. Trump’s aides as inspiration  —   to hang in the Oval Office. “Now, I’m working,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, punctuating his focus by cataloging the work of the day: an executive order restarting the Keystone XL pipeline and his plans for   actions over the next days. Mr. Trump is in the meantime pondering his first break away from the White House, a potential trip to    his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. possibly the weekend of Feb. 3. Until then, he is breaking in the residence, which Mrs. Trump is still working on decorating. “It’s a beautiful residence, it’s very elegant,” Mr. Trump said, deploying one of his highest forms of praise. “There’s something very special when you know that Abraham Lincoln slept there,” Mr. Trump said. “The Lincoln Bedroom, you know, was his office, and the suite where I’m staying is actually where he slept. ” Mr. Trump was referring to the White House master bedroom, which is now his own. “Knowing all of that, it’s different, than, you know, just pure elegance and room size,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s a lot of history. ”",0,1075,18.220338983050848,59,0.24558139534883722,0,0,0,0,93.00626603305437,23.430115104533712,89.01649048625792,44.50511627906977,0.8288372093023256,0.014883720930232559,0.04837209302325581,0.03627906976744186,0.017674418604651163,0.008372093023255815,0.21674418604651163,0.0009302325581395349,0.0009302325581395349,0.020465116279069766,0.08558139534883721,0.0009302325581395349,0.05674418604651163,0.01674418604651163,0.005581395348837209,0.005581395348837209,0.004651162790697674,0.053023255813953486,0.0037209302325581397,0.07627906976744186,0.017674418604651163,0.04279069767441861,0,0,0.014883720930232559,0.0037209302325581397,0.08744186046511628,0,0.0065116279069767444,0.0027906976744186047,0.005581395348837209,0,0.0065116279069767444,0.05488372093023256,0,0,0.4530232558139535,0.0027906976744186047,0.017674418604651163,0.030697674418604652,0.004651162790697674,0.026046511627906978,0.0027906976744186047,0.008372093023255815,0.013023255813953489,0.01953488372093023,0.014883720930232559,0.08093023255813954,0.004651162790697674,0.01581395348837209,0.0037209302325581397,0.0037209302325581397,0.0027906976744186047,0,0.017674418604651163,0.2186046511627907,0.009302325581395349,0,0.04186046511627907,0.08093023255813954,0.08837209302325581,0.07441860465116279,0.013953488372093023,0.06046511627906977,0.1516279069767442,0.10046511627906977,0.012093023255813953,0,0.026046511627906978,0.19348837209302325,0,0.0037209302325581397,0.0018604651162790699,0.0009302325581395349,0.020465116279069766,0,0,0.05581395348837209,0.14325581395348838,0.10046511627906977,0,0.014883720930232559,0.011162790697674419,0.07813953488372093,0.12744186046511627,0.12372093023255815,0,0.04093023255813953,0.0027906976744186047,65.15,5,22.25,3.5,0,1,7,1,4,21,1.675,6,12.25,0,65.15,0,94.075,8,45.25,141.325,94.075,,0.6547664459756807,0.12706116049625688,0.39310170586460264,0.09246752152534676,0,0.02828764043650156,0.1692819597899623,0.02828764043650156,0.10429940919118673,0.37939606166081474,0.04649403334518499,0.14869472766417136,0.26286917304621193,0,0.10429940919118673,0,0.07963515543986625,0.006772056800626415,0.03830444627854316,0.119632615918566,0.6677843993573387,0.880367384081434,35
165,"Bestselling conservative author Ann Coulter, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest and staunchest supporters, railed against the Obamacare 2. 0 bill championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday. [Obamacare 2. 0 would inflict severe healthcare costs on Rust Belt voters while easing taxes on counties that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to Bloomberg News. Trump swept into the White House on a populist wave because voters protested mass immigration policies, erosive trade deals, and   Middle Eastern military conflicts —  not because they wanted another “crazy corporatist agenda,” Coulter tweeted.

C. and their wealthy insurance company allies.",0,398,15.92,25,0.32914572864321606,0,0,0,0,86.85965541995694,8.63559987437186,54.985697719366065,29.987177265638536,0.6884422110552764,0.01507537688442211,0.03768844221105527,0.02512562814070352,0.05527638190954774,0.017587939698492462,0.29396984924623115,0.010050251256281407,0,0.022613065326633167,0.04271356783919598,0,0.05025125628140704,0.005025125628140704,0,0.01507537688442211,0.007537688442211055,0.07035175879396985,0.005025125628140704,0.08542713567839195,0.01507537688442211,0.032663316582914576,0,0,0.017587939698492462,0.017587939698492462,0.07537688442211055,0.01256281407035176,0,0,0,0,0.002512562814070352,0.03768844221105527,0,0,0.2864321608040201,0.002512562814070352,0.007537688442211055,0.005025125628140704,0.002512562814070352,0.032663316582914576,0,0,0.01256281407035176,0.005025125628140704,0,0,0.052763819095477386,0.01256281407035176,0.022613065326633167,0.02512562814070352,0,0,0.07537688442211055,0.23366834170854273,0.0678391959798995,0.02763819095477387,0.01507537688442211,0.04773869346733668,0.11055276381909548,0.01507537688442211,0.02763819095477387,0.04271356783919598,0.0829145728643216,0.04773869346733668,0.01256281407035176,0.005025125628140704,0.020100502512562814,0.11306532663316583,0,0.01256281407035176,0.005025125628140704,0.002512562814070352,0.005025125628140704,0,0,0,0.04773869346733668,0.06030150753768844,0,0.005025125628140704,0.005025125628140704,0.04271356783919598,0.08542713567839195,0.10552763819095477,0.005025125628140704,0.08542713567839195,0.002512562814070352,1,0,37.760000000000005,0,5,2,6,19,3.73,24,5,16,6,0,1,4,36.46,12,75.32,113.78,36.46,,0.042806973496989774,0,0.6280700774062618,0,0.1827439976315568,0.08209951522176571,0.21156051433186934,0.45937349442417297,0.14296292899100213,0.5176800710532957,0.1827439976315568,0.417093755737567,0.21156051433186934,0,0.32077101907294,0.15174115516527187,0.0764713284953228,0.025168840974873107,0.1579764251856202,0.23864256051008853,-0.7107922664440841,0.7613574394899114,35
166,"CHESTER, Vt.  —   The way A J Jackson tells it, he kept his head ducked down and pretended to fiddle with his cellphone as he walked into the boys’ bathroom and headed for a stall at Green Mountain Union High School here. But the way some of his classmates see it, A J was still Autumn Jackson, a girl in boys’ clothing, who had violated an intimate sanctum, while two boys were standing at a urinal, their private parts exposed. “It’s like me going into a girls’ bathroom wearing a wig,” Tanner Bischofberger, 15, a classmate of A J Jackson’s, who was not one of those in the bathroom, said this week. “It’s just weird. ” A complaint about Mr. Jackson’s using the boys’ bathroom set off a protest by students advocating the right of their transgender classmate to use the bathroom of his choice. On Thursday, the schools superintendent announced a new practice at the high school allowing transgender students to use the   bathroom of their choice, rather than being encouraged to use a   bathroom. The announcement came a day before the Obama  administration’s national directive was announced. But this week, there was a counterprotest by students like Mr. Bischofberger wearing   showing the male and female figures commonly used to label bathrooms, over the words “Straight Pride. ” Like much of the country, this rural school of 300 students in seventh through 12th grade, where everyone insists there were never any cliques, is divided over the bathroom issue, with the teenagers here carrying out a proxy culture war for their parents and the country. Still struggling to form opinions about what makes a civil society, they openly quote what they have heard their parents say about the merits or demerits of transgender bathrooms. And the dispute has driven apart young people who grew up together and were once friends. Some say the new rule opens the door to sexual predators disguised as someone they are not. Others say it just violates tradition. A society has rules for a reason, and this is one of those rules, that’s just the way it is, they say. But on a more basic level, students at Green Mountain are complaining that a small vocal minority of gay, lesbian and, as far as they know, one  —   or maybe two  —   transgender students among them are trampling on the rights of the majority to decide what the rules of conduct should be. That idea of a minority’s ruling unfairly is what motivated the father of one student to order the “Straight Pride”   online last week and send them to school with his daughter, who declined to be interviewed. The    students say gay people are being celebrated at the expense of straight people. “I just want to be clear: I accept everybody being proud,” said Daniel Baldwin, a    junior. Sitting at a table in the school hallway, a copy of “The Catcher in the Rye” open in front of him, he wore a “Straight Pride” shirt pulled over a shirt dedicated to Slayer, a   band. “Everybody has the right to be who they are. ” Mr. Baldwin said he thought people should use male or female bathrooms depending on what was written on their birth certificates. But he also said he would defend A J if someone tried to bully him for being transgender, or even for using the boys’ bathroom. “I would step up for A J,” he said. “We’re Americans. We’re supposed to be civil. ” Listening to him, Mr. Jackson said he was dismayed by how they had been torn apart. “Oh, my God, we used to talk for hours about music,” he said. More broadly, the issue here has pitted resident against resident, often along social and economic lines. This is a place where   transplants wearing Birkenstocks and artsy jewelry mingle with   people in   boots who know how to handle a shotgun and proudly inhabit the homes of their ancestors. Despite Vermont’s image as a place of bucolic egalitarianism, home of the avowedly socialist candidate for president, tensions over privilege and tradition simmer just under the surface, and the bathroom wars have brought them to the fore. “I go in and do my thing and leave, but I have a concern about child molesters and pedophiles,” Joe Kopacz, 48, who runs a   operation, said as he stopped into Lisai’s Chester Market. Society does not change on a dime, especially   society, said Deb Brown, a member of the Green Mountain Union High School board, speaking in MacLaomainn’s, a pub and popular gathering spot that she owns with her husband. For people like her daughter, who was on girls’ sports teams with A J when he was Autumn, this is intensely personal, not just philosophical. “As we move forward as a community, there has to be compassion on both sides,” Ms. Brown said. “He needs to understand that this has been 15 years that students have known him one way. It’s obviously his choice, but maybe he should have respect for his classmates right now. ” Mr. Jackson has gradually been making the transition from a vivacious girl with a big smile and long wavy locks to a husky boy with chopped hair dyed several shades of green, snakebite piercings in his lips and gauges embedded in his earlobes. His chest is visibly bound, and because he has not yet started taking male hormones  —   he plans to do that, and also to have “top surgery,” he says  —   his face is smooth and still has feminine contours. He once thought he was lesbian, and is still attracted to girls. His mother, Tracy, a case manager for children with developmental disabilities, and his father, Scott, a mechanical engineer, came to Vermont from Connecticut to try it out 20 years ago and stayed. They brought up A J and his older brother in a log cabin in the woods, where they raise chickens and ducks, including a duck named Bernie, for you know who. “A typical American family,” his mother said, smiling. He was in sixth grade when he realized he was meant to be a boy, he said, and came out to the school last year in ninth grade, sending emails to teachers. When he entered Green Mountain in seventh grade, “I was using the female bathroom because, I really don’t know, I was still kind of back and forth about my identity,” Mr. Jackson said. “This year is the year I started using the men’s bathroom, because I already felt like way more comfortable in who I was. ” There were practical issues. When he had his period, he wondered if he should revert to the girls’ bathroom, because there was no place to throw away his used tampons. But he had started feeling like an intruder in the girls’ bathroom, and the single bathrooms were so far out of the way it was hard to get to class on time. So he stuck with the boys’ bathroom. “I use a stall, and I wait till everybody’s gone to get up and leave,” Mr. Jackson said. “The guys, they look at me like I’m some kind of freak, or they’re concerned or scared. ” The only classmate who talks to him when he sees him in the bathroom is his childhood friend Connor Rose, a leader of the school’s   alliance. Mr. Jackson feels safe in the boys’ bathroom at school, he said, whereas in public places, like Dunkin’ Donuts, he is afraid to go to the men’s restroom for fear of being attacked by straight men. He said he understood the concerns of some of his classmates. “There probably are some transgender people that are bad people, just like there are probably a whole bunch of gay people or straight people that are bad,” he said. He had been using the boys’ bathrooms for less than a month  —   trying to go in during lunch or recess when he would not be noticed  —   when someone complained. No one knows for sure who complained, but a widespread rumor holds that it was a middle schooler. Hank Mauti, a school board member and retired sawmill worker from Andover, said he wondered why Mr. Jackson would feel compelled to use a boys’ bathroom when there were six     bathrooms in the school. “What about the little boy that reported it?” asked Mr. Mauti’s wife, Wanda, repeating the rumor, in an interview in their home, under a trophy of a moose that Mr. Mauti shot. “As far as I can tell, his discomfort hasn’t been addressed. ” Tom Ferenc, the principal, called Mr. Jackson’s mother the night of the complaint and told her that he was going to ask A J to use the   bathroom, she recalled. The next Monday, A J and about 30 supporters walked out of the school in protest. Three days later, the district announced the new policy. Mr. Ferenc was happy to get some “clarity” about the proper policy, as he put it, and proud of his school. “It reminded me of Rosa Parks, honestly,” he said. Besides the “Straight Pride”   counterprotest, the decision has set off a storm of discussion, sometimes nasty on both sides, on Facebook. Also, someone taped a sign to a trash can this week that said, “Reserved for Mariah and Tanner,” referring to Mariah Lique and Mr. Bischofberger, two student leaders of the counterprotest, who are dating. Ms. Lique said that she and Mr. Bischofberger were just saying what a lot of other students think but are afraid to say because if they did, “you’d get hated. ” “We’re considered more conservative,” she said. “Because we’re outspoken,” Mr. Bischofberger interjected, finishing her sentence. Two of their favorite teachers are openly gay, they said, and the students misunderstand where they are coming from. “They see us as   …    ” Mr. Bischofberger began, “hating their sexuality,” Ms. Lique finished. But that is not true, they said. Part of what troubles them is that Mr. Jackson is still anatomically female. “Autumn, A J, whatever you call them, hasn’t had any hormone or sex change yet,” Mr. Bischofberger said. “This opens up opportunities for other kids to do stuff they’re not supposed to. ” While everyone seems to sympathize with the gay students, they seem to have a license to make him feel ostracized and attacked, and it hurts, Mr. Bischofberger said: “They’re calling me a cisgendered, hypocritical homophobe. ”",0,1749,21.8625,80,0.2698684962835906,0,0,0,0,82.24803288954233,11.81940229581739,92.18243825445526,20.568705927196493,0.8650657518582047,0.012006861063464836,0.04631217838765009,0.04059462550028588,0.03430531732418525,0.020011435105774727,0.2086906803887936,0.006289308176100629,0.004002287021154946,0.024013722126929673,0.08576329331046312,0,0.06975414522584333,0.016009148084619784,0.007432818753573471,0.019439679817038306,0.00686106346483705,0.09262435677530018,0.0011435105774728416,0.08061749571183534,0.018867924528301886,0.058319039451114926,0,0.0017152658662092624,0.025157232704402517,0.008576329331046312,0.0851915380217267,0,0.007432818753573471,0.004574042309891366,0.017724413950829045,0,0.002287021154945683,0.06174957118353345,0.006289308176100629,0.006289308176100629,0.4957118353344768,0.002287021154945683,0.022298456260720412,0.018296169239565466,0.012578616352201259,0.04516866781017725,0.0011435105774728416,0.0005717552887364208,0.02172670097198399,0.02115494568324757,0.019439679817038306,0.0634648370497427,0.002287021154945683,0.018867924528301886,0.008004574042309892,0.018296169239565466,0,0.0005717552887364208,0.01429388221841052,0.2550028587764437,0.004002287021154946,0,0.03544882790165809,0.058319039451114926,0.061177815894797025,0.07947398513436249,0.014865637507146942,0.049170954831332186,0.13550600343053174,0.12464265294453973,0.013150371640937679,0.0005717552887364208,0.040022870211549454,0.13150371640937678,0.0005717552887364208,0.003430531732418525,0.004574042309891366,0.0005717552887364208,0.008576329331046312,0,0.005717552887364208,0.04345340194396798,0.18238993710691823,0.07318467695826186,0.0005717552887364208,0.024013722126929673,0.017724413950829045,0.0411663807890223,0.14065180102915953,0.15894797026872498,0.004002287021154946,0.03544882790165809,0.0017152658662092624,60,0,105.625,18.45,17.75,13,20,52,16.83,93.325,11.5,36.125,48,8,60,0,172.45499999999998,43,252.675,458.13,172.45499999999998,,0.6,0,0.7253218884120172,0.31565440547476475,0.30735930735930733,0.24528301886792453,0.3333333333333333,0.5652173913043478,0.2961464015484779,0.6999812488280518,0.22330097087378642,0.4745484400656814,0.5454545454545454,0.16666666666666666,0.21568627450980393,0,0.08215546440668275,0.020484676985227213,0.12037129668005317,0.21824755970330564,-0.7393257341643727,0.7817524402966943,108
167,"in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , War Propaganda , World News October 20 marked the fifth anniversary of Muammar Gaddafi’s sodomized-related death – US imperial viciousness responsible for his murder and destruction Africa’s most developed, socially responsible nation. Endless violence and chaos replaced a society safe and fit to live in. Gaddafi provided Libyans with important benefits Americans can’t imagine. More on this below. Hillary orchestrated war to eliminate him, wanting US-controlled puppet governance replacing Libyan sovereign independence. In early 2011, made-in-the-USA protests preceded US-led NATO terror-bombing, indiscriminately massacring civilians, creating charnel house conditions. Endless violence continues daily, exacerbated by ISIS fighters infesting parts of the country, Washington supporting them with funding, weapons and other material aid. Obama and Hillary wanted Gaddafi eliminated for instituting policies all nations should embrace. Previous articles discussed them. He supported pan-Africanism, a United States of Africa free from imperial domination. He wanted Libyans sharing in the country’s oil wealth, a notion foreign to America and other Western powers. Under his 1999 Decision No. 111, all Libyans got free healthcare, education, electricity, water, training, rehabilitation, housing assistance, disability and old-age benefits, interest-free state loans, as well as generous subsidies to study abroad, buy a new car, help couples when they marry, practically free gasoline, and more. Literacy under Gaddafi rose from 20 – 80%. Libya’s hospitals and private clinics were some of the region’s best. Now they’re in shambles. Vital public services he provided no longer exist. Pre-war, Libyans had African’s highest standard of living. Homelessness was nonexistent. Gaddafi believed all Libyans had a right to a home or rent-free apartment, notions unheard of in the West. He rejected farcical Western-style money-controlled democracy (sic), deplored crony capitalism and neoliberal harshness. During his tenure, women had the right to vote, participate politically, as well as own and sell property independently of their husbands. Clause 5 of Libya’s 1969 Constitution granted them equal status with men, notably for education and employment. In January 2011, weeks before US-led NATO naked aggression began, the UN Human Rights Council praised Gaddafi for instituting and supporting important political, economic, education, social and cultural rights. He called his Great Man-Made River (GMMR) development of an ocean-sized aquifer beneath Libya’s sands the “Eighth Wonder of the World” – wanting all Libyans sharing in its benefits. Washington and rogue Western partners wanted it privatized for exclusive corporate gain. Under Gaddafi, the Central Bank of Libya was state-owned, the interest-free Libyan dinar used for productive economic growth, not speculation, profits and bonuses for predatory bankers. He funded Africa’s only communications satellite, saving hundreds of millions of dollars for low-cost incoming and outgoing calls. He provided two-thirds of the $42 billion needed to launch a public African Central Bank, Monetary Fund and Investment Bank. He supported a new gold standard, replacing dollars with gold dinars, aiming to provide real monetary wealth and value, free from predatory Western lending agencies. Washington wants dollar hegemony, maintaining it as the world’s reserve currency, an agenda challenged by Russia, China and other nations, increasingly trading bilaterally in their own currencies. Russia’s Vladimir Putin is threatened. Neocons infesting Washington want regime change. His redoubtable leadership prevents it. Will nuclear war on Russia follow Hillary’s ascension to power next year? Will the unthinkable become reality?

168,"Citizen journalism with a punch How NATO Is Trying to Sabotage the Turkey-Russia Reset Deployments to the Black Sea and rhetoric on Aleppo are serving one important goal -- placing pressure on Turkey to backpedal on rapprochement with Moscow Originally appeared at Indian Punchline The Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Jens Stoltenberg in his ‘doorstep statement’ today on the 2-day meeting of the alliance’s defence ministers in Brussels said, inter alia, that an agenda item concerns “making progress on plans” for more NATO presence in the Black Sea region. He cited Russia’s belligerence as the rationale for such move. Interestingly, there was much emphasis on the Russian operations in Syria in Stoltenberg’s media briefing. ( Transcript ) Prima facie, Syria is not ‘NATO territory’, but a linkage is being established between NATO posturing toward Russia and the latter’s military presence in Syria. This can only happen at the behest of the United States, because Stoltenberg wouldn’t even sneeze sans green signal from Washington. Of course, generally speaking, boosting the ‘enemy’ image of Russia is useful and necessary for Washington to keep the alliance going, since the member countries are otherwise loathe to increase their defence budgets to 2% of GDP. The US also calibrates the NATO posturing toward Russia to curb any proximity developing between individual European countries and Moscow at the bilateral level as well as to ensure that the sanctions against Russia will remain in place. However, the plan to discuss Black Sea deployment as well as Stoltenberg’s emphasis on Aleppo also appears to serve another US objective – namely, put pressure on Turkey to delimit its strategic autonomy vis-à-vis Syrian conflict. Significantly, NATO intervened publicly – alongside an American demarche – to force Spain to refuse refuelling for the Russian flotilla of warships (including aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov) heading for eastern Mediterranean. This has been justified on the ground that with beefed up military prowess, Russian operations in Aleppo might intensify. ( RT ) The alibi that NATO has advanced is laughable – namely, humanitarian considerations – given the alliance’s brutal war crimes in Libya and its role in the gruesome murder of Muammar Gaddafi. Seumas Milne wrote in Guardian newspaper at that time, ‘If there were global justice, NATO would be in the dock over Libya.’ ( Guardian ) So, why is Stoltenberg acting like this? The answer is, Spain’s rethink on refuelling the Russian flotilla on the basis of a NATO demarche, is intended to create a precedent that will also be applicable to Turkey. Indeed, Washington is having a difficult time to ‘manage’ Turkey. Turkish President Recep Erdogan is on guard vis-à-vis Washington ever since Ankara concluded that the US had a hand in the July 15 attempted coup to overthrow his government. Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus had some strong words for the Obama administration when he left Ankara for Washington on Tuesday on a mission to put more pressure on Washington to extradite the Islamist preacher Fetullah Gulen. (Hurriyet) But then, wouldn’t Ankara know that Washington simply cannot extradite Gulen who has worked for the CIA? Of course the Turks would know that alright. So, it is a catch-22 situation. Gulen has become a lump stuck in Uncle Sam’s throat. Read a caustic commentary by the pro-government Sabah newspaper titled What happens if Washington refuses to extradite Fetullah Gulen? To be sure, Turkey’s role in any plans on NATO deployment in the Black Sea will be crucial because of its prerogatives under the Montreaux Convention (1936), which severely restricts the traffic of warships (other than Turkey and Russia’s) through the Bosporus. In principle, Turkey will be obliged to go along with any NATO plans to step up deployment in the Black Sea. But in reality, Turkey would know that Moscow expects it to fully and faithfully observe the provisions of the Montreaux Convention. You bet Erdogan will twiddle thumbs and keep Stoltenberg waiting in the ante-room, no matter the decision to accelerate NATO deployment in the Black Sea. Clearly, the US hopes to somehow insert NATO into the Turkey-Russia rapprochement. Washington feels uneasy that Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin are effectively coordinating their approaches to the Aleppo situation. What emerges out of all this is the desperate extent to which Washington will go to stall the progress of the Russian-Syrian mlitary operations to liberate Aleppo from the al-Qaeda affiliate Nusra. Conceivably, the Obama administration would prefer to somehow keep the Syrian situation fluid for Hillary Clinton to do what she promises to do — namely, revive the ‘regime change agenda in that country, if need be through a US military intervention. (See the piece in Telegraph titled Hillary Clinton will reset Syria policy against ‘murderous’ Assad regime .) Erdogan disclosed today that the Turkish military operations in northern Syria will steer clear of Aleppo. He said he has discussed the matter with Putin. At the same time, he gave a punch to Washington by revealing that Turkey next intends to target Manbij in northern Syria with a view to drive out from the city the Syrian Kurdish militia, who happen to be the US’ closest ally on the Syrian chessboard.

169,"161 Views November 16, 2016 GOLD , KWN , KWN II King World News In the aftermath of what has been a wild couple of weeks of trading, today a former associate of George Soros told King World News that the professionals have it completely wrong and that gold and silver are going to skyrocket like the 1970s. Victor Sperandeo manages over $3 billion, has been in the business 45 years, and has worked with famous individuals such as Leon Cooperman and George Soros. Below is what Sperandeo had to say . Victor Sperandeo: “ The base metals are going through the roof. Why? Because inventories were so low and demand is picking up. Inflation is rising all over the world because all of the currencies across the globe have been plunging, except for the U.S. dollar… IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored And with regards to a Trump presidency, yes, you will get growth. But you will also get rising interest rates and rising inflation. If you look back to the 1970s, that’s why gold went up 31 percent a year from 1971-1980 (see remarkable chart below). This is what the professionals are missing, Eric. We are going to have a lot of inflation going forward and that will be extremely bullish for both gold and silver, which will soon catch up to the rest of the industrial metals. People just need to look at the 1970s in order to understand the roadmap for higher gold and silver prices. The Days Of Low Inflation Are Over 5-year compounded rates of inflation are now at the lowest levels since 1961. 1.56 percent compounded is the rate of 5-year inflation. Again, Eric, that is the lowest in 55 years. The 10-year compounded rate of CPI is 1.87 percent per year. This is all coming to an end, Eric. Worldwide central banks have failed. Their policies have failed. Now there is going to be spending and debt will increase. Meaning, the days of low inflation have come to an end. Massive Inflation Is Coming – Gold & Silver Will Skyrocket What we are looking at going forward is massive inflation. If you remember, Eric, inflation was so out of control in the 1970s that there were times when people would purchase a high-quality used car and it would be worth more money one year later than what they originally paid for it — that’s how bad inflation was. And during that historic run, gold went up 25.5 times and silver went up 38 times in price. This is what the professionals are missing, Eric.

171,"Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails?   These past few days have seen a major shift in the Clinton tactics. During the original investigation, the Clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at Republicans for ""wasting time"" investigating Hillary, but did not attack the FBI. It misrepresented FBI statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. But now we have open hostilities between Lynch at the DOJ and the FBI. We have the Clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the FBI. We have countless media hit pieces aimed at the FBI. The obvious question is why. The Clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. It certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the FBI. That's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. That is to say everyone who isn't in the media. So what's going on here? 1. The Clintons thought they were done. It's close to the election. So they're lashing out. It's typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the Clintons. Hillary tried playing humble. She tried apologizing. But a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now she's in a state of fury at having it put at risk. 2. There is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the Clinton campaign. Which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the FBI with both barrels. It's desperate to smear the FBI as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. The attacks are a warning to treat Hillary with kid gloves again... or else. The first is plausible. To a degree. But for all of Hillary's awkwardness, she didn't lose it in the past. Why is she losing it now? There's no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. And yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. If the Clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like.",1,348,10.545454545454545,33,0.28160919540229884,0,0,0,0,77.56097925063442,31.47290640394088,56.85655172413793,1.351250845165652,0.8333333333333334,0.020114942528735632,0.028735632183908046,0.05172413793103448,0.07183908045977011,0.014367816091954023,0.1724137931034483,0.020114942528735632,0.020114942528735632,0.03735632183908046,0.10344827586206896,0.0028735632183908046,0.09482758620689655,0.0028735632183908046,0,0.011494252873563218,0.020114942528735632,0.12931034482758622,0,0.028735632183908046,0.017241379310344827,0.05747126436781609,0.0028735632183908046,0.0028735632183908046,0.05172413793103448,0.008620689655172414,0.09195402298850575,0,0,0.0028735632183908046,0.014367816091954023,0,0.011494252873563218,0.04597701149425287,0,0,0.514367816091954,0.0028735632183908046,0.0028735632183908046,0,0,0.07758620689655173,0.0028735632183908046,0,0.020114942528735632,0.020114942528735632,0.005747126436781609,0,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.05172413793103448,0,0,0.008620689655172414,0.22701149425287356,0.0028735632183908046,0,0.014367816091954023,0.08620689655172414,0.022988505747126436,0.031609195402298854,0.020114942528735632,0.04885057471264368,0.1235632183908046,0.10919540229885058,0.022988505747126436,0.008620689655172414,0.005747126436781609,0.13218390804597702,0,0.005747126436781609,0.014367816091954023,0.005747126436781609,0.008620689655172414,0,0,0.014367816091954023,0.07183908045977011,0.06321839080459771,0,0.03735632183908046,0.0028735632183908046,0.04885057471264368,0.15229885057471265,0.15229885057471265,0.011494252873563218,0.014367816091954023,0.0028735632183908046,8,0,37.275,0,8,0,0,19,5.83,41.25,0,11,1,0,8,0,27.83,0,114.525,140.355,27.83,,0.237455908152084,0,0.5919911797183086,0,0.237455908152084,0,0,0.4251466153487455,0.18495919939316638,0.6162192016898907,0,0.2998054113740869,0.03746656321294425,0,0.13472338607037426,0,0.06179569450766617,0,0.2542993860399019,0.3116541395121626,-0.8267619126240008,0.6883458604878374,38
172,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, smarting from a series of crises, moved his surrogates aside on Thursday and assigned the rescue of his   presidency to the only spokesman he’s ever really trusted  —   himself. For days, a frustrated and simmering president fumed inside the West Wing residence about what aides said he saw as his staff’s inadequate defense and the ineffectiveness of his own tweets. Over the objections of some top advisers who wanted to steer him away from confrontation, Mr. Trump demanded to face the media, determined to reject the narrative that his administration is sinking into chaos, scandal and incompetence. In a rowdy,    news conference hastily staged in the East Room, Mr. Trump attempted to deflect attention from news coverage about Russian intelligence, the resignation of his national security adviser, the defeat of his labor secretary nominee, and deepening questions about his ability to govern. “I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos,” Mr. Trump said as he attempted  —   with little discipline  —   to read from prepared remarks listing his accomplishments since being inaugurated one month ago. “Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine. ” From there he offered a disjointed and emotional performance in which he appeared to release   anger and suspicion about the “dishonest media,” Democrats, intelligence officials, “criminal” leakers, Hillary Clinton, environmentalists and judges. Taking a room of reporters and the television audience on a journey through the Trump psyche, the president was at times angry (at the news media) playful (“I love this,”) bewildered (by “bias and hatred”) occasionally respectful (“It’s a great honor to be with you”) and needy (“I’m really not a bad person, by the way”). Ever the salesman, Mr. Trump painted his presidency as he wishes it to be: an Electoral College victory so massive it was historic  —   a falsehood pointed out by a reporter in the room  —   plus accomplishments in the first four weeks that have outpaced, he said, every other president. For his supporters, the performance was certain to be energizing. Mr. Trump turned sober questions from journalists into, at times, mesmerizing television. He attempted to reassert his command of “dishonest” journalists at a time when the news media is questioning his capacity to lead. It all made the brooding boss feel better, people close to Mr. Trump said. The news conference, they said, was Mr. Trump’s best effort at spitting the bit out of his mouth and escaping the bridle of the West Wing, where he views his only way to communicate his side of any argument is his   limited Twitter feed. Still, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump’s   performance will divert much   attention from questions about his campaign’s relationship with Russia, or reassure wavering Republicans on Capitol Hill that their agenda is on track. Yet Mr. Trump’s close allies said he had met his more immediate goal of soothing himself with a sense of control over his own administration. Mr. Trump, who has long required employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, has been unnerved, aides said, by leaks big and small, ranging from disclosures about his evenings spent alone in the White House residence to the details of his calls with global leaders. Now, Mr. Trump finds himself at the mercy of a vast, leaky bureaucracy. “The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it?” Mr. Trump said of the leaks. “The press should be ashamed of themselves. ’’ The news conference was not without its high points for the embattled president. His initial statement about a surge of optimism in the business world and more jobs was, however fleetingly, a focused message on the issue that helped elect him. And he lured a few reporters into a trap of debating the quality of their reporting as opposed to the merits of their original questions. And after complaining to aides about the dour delivery of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, at the daily televised briefing, Mr. Trump laced his own banter with humor. But he also revealed how crushing he is finding the onslaught of criticism that a president receives, saying that he has long preferred the business media to the political press corps he must now deal with. With the same lack of discipline that his supporters on the campaign trail found refreshing, Mr. Trump lashed out at the news media, which he called “out of control. ” He accused The New York Times of publishing what he termed a “discredited” story  —   evidently a reference to an article this week about current and former American officials who say that phone records and intercepted calls show that members of his campaign had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. He said The Wall Street Journal had published an article that was “almost as disgraceful. ” He mocked Jim Acosta, a CNN correspondent, saying at one point, “Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. ” His exchange with Mr. Acosta  —   a frequent foil for Mr. Trump in his news conferences on the campaign trail  —   made it clear that the president believes that the American people are with him, and against the news media. “That’s why the public sees it,” Mr. Trump said. “They see it. They see it’s not fair. The public is smart, they understand it. ” Mr. Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama  —   whom he had often described in glowing terms since his inauguration  —   for handing him a failing government. “I inherited a mess,” Mr. Trump asserted. “It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. ” At one point, Mr. Trump searched for a new face among the veteran White House reporters who were challenging him and settled on a journalist wearing a skullcap whom he clearly did not recognize, hoping for the best. “Are you a friendly reporter? ’’ Mr. Trump said. The response of the reporter, Jake Turx of Ami magazine, a Jewish publication, could not be heard in the room. The president’s anger then flared when Mr. Turx asked about a rise in   incidents around the country. Telling Mr. Turx to sit down and accusing him of lying about asking a “very straight, simple question,” Mr. Trump rejected the charge that he is personally    —   something the reporter had explicitly said he was not asserting. At one point, Mr. Trump predicted how the news media would cover the event  —   and preemptively rejected that, too. “Tomorrow, they will say, ‘Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,’” Mr. Trump said. “I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. ”",0,1150,19.166666666666668,60,0.2965217391304348,0,0,0,0,89.4944099378882,5.805958132045087,88.48076923076923,19.294685990338163,0.82,0.020869565217391306,0.0391304347826087,0.0391304347826087,0.057391304347826085,0.010434782608695653,0.21478260869565216,0.010434782608695653,0.0026086956521739132,0.02,0.09565217391304348,0.0008695652173913044,0.05391304347826087,0.00782608695652174,0.0052173913043478265,0.011304347826086957,0.009565217391304347,0.07391304347826087,0.0017391304347826088,0.06347826086956522,0.014782608695652174,0.042608695652173914,0,0,0.01652173913043478,0.008695652173913044,0.11043478260869566,0,0,0.0052173913043478265,0,0,0.00782608695652174,0.04434782608695652,0.0017391304347826088,0.0017391304347826088,0.4643478260869565,0,0.019130434782608695,0.00782608695652174,0.010434782608695653,0.04434782608695652,0.0017391304347826088,0.0008695652173913044,0.022608695652173914,0.017391304347826087,0.0052173913043478265,0.07739130434782608,0.00608695652173913,0.010434782608695653,0.008695652173913044,0.030434782608695653,0.0008695652173913044,0,0.00608695652173913,0.18,0.01217391304347826,0.004347826086956522,0.03826086956521739,0.07130434782608695,0.07130434782608695,0.0791304347826087,0.02608695652173913,0.07652173913043478,0.13826086956521738,0.12347826086956522,0.008695652173913044,0.0026086956521739132,0.0391304347826087,0.12956521739130436,0.0017391304347826088,0.009565217391304347,0.006956521739130435,0.00782608695652174,0.013043478260869565,0,0,0.05478260869565217,0.15043478260869564,0.0782608695652174,0,0.01391304347826087,0.008695652173913044,0.042608695652173914,0.10173913043478261,0.11130434782608696,0,0.05391304347826087,0.0052173913043478265,50,12,131.875,5,14.75,14,8,66.625,18,54,29,36,37.75,0,50,0,175.5,31,247.625,443.125,175.5,,0.5907301480239404,0.2572842744474721,0.7919658603897546,0.12613198362288316,0.29863730591800375,0.2878229343817586,0.1876127897984334,0.6579206187039647,0.34193868804200434,0.6091987924391681,0.4556809704455399,0.5096189432334203,0.5214735475056823,0,0.5858369763384681,0,0.11841106519355656,0.02091591464957409,0.1670743021000253,0.298979505777178,-0.7464818522900242,0.701020494222822,111
173,"Policing in America today is a rib dinner paid for by a stranger, and a protester kicking a dent into your patrol car door. It’s warning a young man speeding down a country road to beware of errant deer, and searching through trash cans for a gun on the streets of a big city. It’s your    daughter calling repeatedly to ask if you’re safe. It’s your mother wishing you could wear plainclothes again. And it’s a kiss and a goodbye that you promise won’t be your last. But it’s also watching a video in your Facebook feed when another officer shoots a black man  —   a therapist, hands raised, trying to help a client who is autistic a young man stopped for a traffic violation a man selling CDs. And it’s facing the protests that follow, which are prompting introspection and even more of an attitude of   . Adapting  —   it’s that, too. Being a warrior one minute, on guard at all times, and minutes later answering the most banal questions: You know a good restaurant around here? How do I get to the highway? About 477, 000 sworn officers serve in the roughly 12, 000 police departments in the United States. The demands, challenges, resources and cultures of each police force vary. But there are also commonalities. With the exception of some cities still awash in violence, crime has dropped, and the job has changed. And after the fatal ambushes of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La.  —   as well as years of intensifying protests about the deaths of black men, women and children at the hands of the police  —   officers everywhere are under pressure to change still more. On the streets of every town and city, each shift is a search for safety. Here’s a look at one such shift, compiled through ridealongs last week with officers in 10 departments  —   big, small, rural, suburban  —   across the United States. Officer Michael Virgilio’s shift has just begun. He is already on high alert. He slowly eases his vehicle out into the alley of a precinct in Seattle (population: 684, 451) scanning left and right as the precinct’s metal garage door trundles down behind him. The brick alley has recessed alcoves that could conceal someone lying in wait, and the new safety protocol in his department says to take no chances, make no assumptions and avoid being predictable. “One of the most vulnerable times in our day is shift change,” Officer Virgilio, 31, says as he checks the route. “It’s a matter of avoiding certain patterns. Anybody who is trying to organize some sort of attack on police officers is going to do some sort of surveillance. They’re going to figure out when our shift changes are, they are going to figure out what doors we use to get in and out of the precinct. And it doesn’t take long to gather that type of intelligence. ” _________ Lt. Scott Finn begins all his shifts in Prince George’s County, Md. (population: 909, 535) a densely packed suburb just outside Washington, D. C. by passing through a set of doors scarred by two bullet holes, each a round shock of silver, embedded in mundane tan paint. A few months before the ambushes in Dallas and Baton Rouge, a man with a   handgun opened fire outside the police station in Landover as officers were leaving roll call. With two of his brothers filming, the police said, the man shot randomly at cars and an ambulance, while officers inside the stationhouse returned fire. A      police detective, Jacai Colson  —   who, like the gunman, was black and dressed in street clothes  —   happened to pull up to the front of the station, on his way into work. A fellow officer mistook him for the assailant and shot him dead. “It was just the fog of war,” Lieutenant Finn says. “Everything had to align perfectly to have something like that happen. ” The lieutenant pushes through the doors and walks to his unmarked patrol car, where he slips on his bulletproof vest, pressing the Velcro on its sides to make sure it is tightly secured. Another shift begins. The call came about an hour in: Shots fired. “We’re going to go in kind of cautious,” Officer Michael Walker of the Milwaukee Police Department says. He’s 39 and    an imposing   veteran of the force on patrol with an affable rookie named Nathan Smalkoski. They speed through the North Side of Milwaukee (population: 600, 155) parts of which have long wrestled with poverty, disinvestment and violence. It’s over 90 degrees outside and it’s busy. The shift will send them to answer a call about the theft of a Lexus. A car wreck. Domestic dispute. School burglary alarm. One assignment after the next, without any breaks, not even for lunch, which amounted to a Brisk Lemonade from a   store. “I’m going to have a heightened awareness of what’s going on here,” Officer Walker says on his way to the   call. He parks a little farther away from some incidents now, to gauge the circumstances more carefully. Six fresh bullet casings are scattered through an alley. A man on a bike says some people sped off in an old Honda. But the report of shots fired came not from a neighbor here, but from ShotSpotter technology, which captures the sounds of gunfire to determine where a shooting is taking place. A worker at a nearby school and many of the neighbors heard the shots but apparently did not call 911. Gunshots happen all the time, some said. “Police! Anybody home?” Officer Walker calls out, loudly knocking on one door. “Hello ma’am, how are you?” he says to a woman who answers. “Am I in trouble?” she says. Officer Walker explains to the elderly couple who live there that their house was hit with a bullet. He climbs to a packed storage room on their second floor and digs under old blankets, lamps, computers and mattresses to find the hole where the bullet came through their wall. Outside, behind yellow police tape, Officer Smalkoski is marking the shell casings. A resident walks up and begins videotaping the officer with his phone. “Everybody records everything,” Officer Smalkoski says. In Park Forest, Ill. (population: 21, 954) where an officer was  shot and critically wounded in March, many residents are tying blue ribbons to trees or installing blue lightbulbs on their porches to show support for the police. In Paulding County, Ga. (population 152, 238) west of Atlanta, a family brought a sign to the sheriff’s headquarters that now hangs in the squad room: “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called Children of God. ” In the Connecticut countryside, children from a local camp have drawn pictures, sent cards and delivered a large poster to the police station, thanking officers for their service. In many places, officers have been showered with gifts of food, Starbucks, cold drinks. “Over the past five days, I’ve had more people offer to buy me a coffee than I can remember,” says Sgt. Thomas Glynn, 46, during a patrol through Cambridge, Mass. (population 106, 844). But officers around the country are also confronting tension, and it’s been building for years. Sergeant Glynn’s city is where, in 2009, Henry Louis Gates Jr. a Harvard professor who is black, was arrested for trying to break into his own home the episode soured police relations with President Obama, who said the Cambridge police had “acted stupidly. ” And in 2013, the fugitive Boston Marathon bombers murdered an M. I. T. police officer. Near Harvard Square, Sergeant Glynn pulls up to a bus at a parking meter that has expired. Another officer had given the driver a ticket and told him to move the bus, but while backing up, the bus driver hit the officer’s motorcycle. The driver, whose first language was not English, grew agitated and shouted, “And you wonder why police officers kill people!” Sergeant Glynn says: “That was not what he meant to say. What he meant to say was, ‘And you wonder why people kill police officers! ’” Dallas and Baton Rouge had made their way to the land of Harvard. The man’s outburst, Sergeant Glynn says, “had everything to do with what’s happening now. ” _________ Lieutenant Finn points to his patrol car’s door. “Like the dent?” he asks. Just days earlier, he says, someone had kicked his car and yelled, “Black lives matter,” before taking off on a motorcycle. It was, he says, part of a pattern of increased tension that he has noticed in Prince George’s County ever since police officers shot and killed Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. on    days this month. Lieutenant Finn says he sees more pushback and hears more obscenities from residents now than ever before. “I’ve never experienced that until just recently,” he says, while driving through a stretch of the county studded with strip malls, just outside Washington. “At this point, I’m fortunate that it was a kick, and not a bullet. We can see that that’s a strong possibility. ” _________ A dark night. A country road in Coventry, Conn. (population: 12, 438). A Dodge Durango races by, going around 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. Sgt. Michael Hicks pulls out behind, following up and down a hill until he reaches a straightaway. The flashing lights go on, the Durango pulls over. A young man with a shaved head sits in the driver’s seat. “I definitely notice that now more people I pull over, if they’re black, they right away turn on the lights and put their hands on the wheel,” Sergeant Hicks says. “I like that. It makes me feel safe. ” He flips on his body camera, gets out of his police S. U. V. and goes through his routine. He puts two fingers on the black Durango’s trunk, to make sure no one is inside  —   two cops were once killed when someone jumped out of a trunk, he explains. He flashes his light into the back seat, then the front, and approaches the driver with his holstered gun on a hip that he positions away from the car window. “We’re trained for Armageddon,” Sergeant Hicks says back in the vehicle. “We’re trained for the worst. ” He returns to the driver, a Hispanic man with no previous traffic violations, and gives him a warning: “Slow down. You hit a deer going 63, and it won’t be good. ” _________ The gangs of Compton, Calif. (population 97, 877)  —   the Crips and the Pirus, the Compton Varrio Tortilla Flats and others  —   hang out in places that are easy to defend: alleys, dead ends and a housing development with “one way in, one way out,” where residents shout warnings to one another as soon as the police arrive. “Gangsters like  ” says Deputy Sheriff Mizrain Orrego, 30, driving with his partner through Compton, the section of Los Angeles County (population: 10, 170, 292) made famous by violence and gangster rap. “They can jump the fence onto the street behind, and we can’t follow in the car. Or they see us coming and toss the pistol over the fence. You ask for help, and everyone walks away and says nothing happened. ” Deputy Orrego and his partner check one    after another. In most spots, men are hanging around outside, often drinking beer, but the officers have no cause to search them. They ask how they’re doing  —   ”You good?”  —   and then move on. But as soon as the police cruiser turns one corner, a young man at the end of the block takes off running. He ducks into the shadows behind an abandoned house, and he’s gone. Deputy Samuel Aldama, 29, hits the gas. The cruiser flies to the end of the   street, and in an instant both he and Deputy Orrego are out of their car, yelling at a group of young black men to put their hands in the air. Each deputy keeps a finger on his weapon, but the guns stay in their holsters. The abandoned house has become a hangout for the South Side Compton Crips, and Deputy Orrego is convinced that there is a gun here  —   or, at least, that there was one. “Every time you get three of these guys together, you know they have a gun somewhere,” Deputy Orrego says. Finding a gun is the primary challenge in the    game that the officers have been playing all day, as part of a summer unit aimed at limiting gang activity. Their shift started at 9 a. m. It’s 11 p. m. The deputies have pulled 18 guns off the streets in the last nine weeks. But none this day. The victim  —   a black man, perhaps in his 30s  —   lies uncovered on the sidewalk of the bus station’s bay, his backpack askew on the pavement. His arm is curled toward his body, frozen a few inches off the ground. In parts of Prince George’s County, a mostly black area,  where some people struggle more than others, this is routine. The call came in as a stabbing. Lieutenant Finn does not respond until he realizes that the victim has died. It is now a homicide. A handful of officers manage the scene. Lieutenant Finn heads for dinner. He says he prefers not to eat in the area he has been patrolling, where he might run into people he arrested or be reminded of where fellow officers were shot. So he drives south, to a Texas Ribs  BBQ in Clinton, Md. Talk turns to the Black Lives Matter protests. “ ‘Black Lives Matter When the Police Kill Them,’ ” Lieutenant Finn says, as if arguing with protesters. “Have that be your name. ” _________ Sometimes  —   especially since the recent shootings by police  —   black residents will say they were pulled over because of racial profiling, Deputy Orrego says. “It’s not true,” he says, driving through Compton and past   homes tagged with graffiti by competing gangs. “We’re minorities as well. ” The news media don’t tell the whole story, he says. “You don’t know what goes on. ” “We all have families to go home to,” he says. “There’s more to it than you think. ” “The reality is that in Compton, in the west side, the reality is you will stop and contact more ” he says. “If you’re on the east side, you’ll contact more Hispanics. ” “The reality is that people who steal cars are mostly Hispanics,” he says. “The reason why is because more Hispanics who are involved in any criminal activity, they use methamphetamine. So now they need to support their habit. Where   they don’t do that for the most part. They don’t consume methamphetamine. ” “The reality is that   at least in the city of Compton  —   and I’m talking from our training and experience  —   they commit more violent crimes, more shootings. There’s more gang feuds among   . ” The cruiser rolls slowly around a corner, his words on crime and race still hanging in the air. _________ Deputy Constable Steve W. Faulkner, 39, joins two other deputies at a taco truck and food trailer parked side by side in a   parking lot in Precinct 1 in Houston (population: 2, 296, 224). They are talking about guns, life, the job. A few days ago, he says, after the attack in Dallas, he and other deputies responded to a call from a woman who had concerns about   messages her teenage daughter had been receiving. The woman and her daughter were black. The deputies were white. The woman and her daughter were not pleased with the deputies after they suggested removing an app from her daughter’s phone as a possible solution. “The younger girl, she’s probably about 13, she just piped up and said, ‘You don’t like black people. If this would have been a white girl, this would have been handled totally different,’” Deputy Faulkner recalls. “That,” he says, “is a direct result of everything going on right now. ” Later in the shift, the dispatcher’s voice fills the car: A group of men are waving a gun in front of a Washateria laundry. One is a Hispanic male in a black shirt and red pants, the other a black male in a white shirt and white shorts. Deputy Faulkner speeds toward the scene, lights on and siren wailing. As he turns into the Washateria parking lot, he sees a black man and three Hispanic men standing next to their cars. He gets out of his car. He is alone. One of the Hispanic men wears a dark gray shirt and red shorts. The deputy pulls his gun and orders all four onto the ground. The men are not happy, though they do as they are told. He handcuffs two of them. He searches them and finds nothing. He uncuffs the two men. He explains why he is there, and the tensions ease up. “Thanks for not shooting me,” one of the men says, smiling as he holds his hands in the air. Deputy Faulkner slides back into the driver’s seat and turns to the four men. “Y’all have a good one,” he says. _________ Officers John Buchanan and Robert Bramble are cruising through   one of Brooklyn’s rapidly changing neighborhoods. Officer Buchanan, 24, is white. He grew up in suburban Suffolk County, on Long Island, where he still lives. He has two cousins who are police officers. Officer Bramble, 24, is black. He grew up in Brooklyn, in East Flatbush. He still lives in the city, about 15 minutes from the stationhouse. His father was a New York City police officer. It is hot, and as they drive along the streets of the 79th Precinct they notice a   sight: “It’s S. O. S. ,” Officer Bramble says. On the sidewalk, a small contingent from the group Save Our Streets is protesting  —   a woman with a bullhorn condemning violence and other people wearing   that say: “Stop shooting. Start living. ” Officer Bramble says the protests are now a part of life in Brooklyn (population: 2, 636, 735). “There are people in the law enforcement world that are hurt right now there’s civilians out there reading and seeing these things, and experiencing them, that hurt right now,” he says. “It affects everybody. ” Even with the tensions surrounding policing, Officer Bramble does not feel defensive. “I don’t personally feel any animosity because I feel like I understand where the protesters I have encountered are coming from and what they’re trying to achieve and establish,” he says. “There may be protesters out there who have a more sinister agenda. I just, in my limited experience, have not encountered them yet. ” Officer Buchanan shifts the discussion to the importance of neighborhood policing. “We can use that to try and change some people’s perspectives, or at least be an example for what policing in a community should be,” he says. Still, he thinks anyone who is not an officer cannot understand the pressures and risks of the job. “You can’t have a perspective on this job, in my opinion, unless you do it,” he says. “Unless you’re in policing, doing it every day as a career, you can’t know what it’s like. ” _________ Cpl. Jon Mannino in Park Forest remembers another example of how things have changed. Shortly after the fatal shooting of Mr. Castile by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, an   driver that Corporal Mannino had pulled over seemed afraid. “He said, ‘I’m reaching for my wallet, don’t shoot me,’” Corporal Mannino says. “And he wasn’t being funny. He wasn’t being sarcastic. ” “What can you say?” the corporal says. “While it’s not personally upsetting, it’s upsetting that that’s where we are right now as a country. ” Deputy Faulkner’s cellphone rings as he sits in his patrol vehicle outside the precinct office. It’s a fellow Houston deputy. “Yeah, I’m fixin’ to roll out,” he tells the caller. He is silent as he holds the phone to his ear, then quickly steps out of the vehicle and heads into the precinct. The deputy was calling to relay a concern. The wife of a lieutenant has been having trouble reaching her husband on his cellphone. She is worried. Deputy Faulkner returns to the vehicle. He reports back: The lieutenant is in the precinct office. He’s fine. He just left his cellphone inside while talking to a colleague outside. It took only those few minutes for the lieutenant’s wife to start panicking. Deputy Faulkner says this is how the job is lately. His own wife calls more often to check on him. He and his    daughter have a ritual before he leaves the house: She stands at the front door and gives him a kiss on the forehead. Lately, though, she has started telling him, “Be safe” and “Be careful,” phrases she had not used before the Dallas ambush. “It changes the way you do patrolling,” Deputy Faulkner says. “Your head’s on a swivel now. ”",0,3554,13.937254901960785,255,0.27771525042205963,0,0,0,0,89.65983380716075,25.360605345483815,85.24336215276001,14.819946794904592,0.825267304445695,0.005346088913899831,0.03460889138998312,0.03545301069217783,0.032639279684862126,0.014631401238041642,0.238885762521103,0.008159819921215531,0.004783342712436691,0.025886325267304444,0.09735509285312324,0.0002813731007315701,0.06668542487338211,0.014631401238041642,0.007315700619020821,0.010973550928531233,0.009003939223410242,0.06527855936972425,0.005346088913899831,0.06809229037703995,0.021384355655599326,0.04839617332583005,0,0.0036578503095104106,0.017163759144625774,0.0036578503095104106,0.07006190208216094,0.0008441193021947102,0.004501969611705121,0.0061902082160945416,0.008722566122678672,0,0.007878446820483961,0.026730444569499155,0.005064715813168261,0.005064715813168261,0.47552054023635343,0.0033764772087788407,0.020258863252673044,0.010410804727068092,0.007315700619020821,0.038548114800225096,0.0019696117051209903,0.0039392234102419805,0.012943162633652222,0.015194147439504783,0.008159819921215531,0.04305008441193022,0.0014068655036578502,0.029825548677546426,0.012099043331457513,0.020258863252673044,0.0011254924029262803,0.0005627462014631402,0.024479459763646596,0.22734946539110862,0.026167698368036015,0.0030951041080472708,0.04276871131119865,0.0694991558806978,0.04305008441193022,0.06837366347777153,0.012380416432189083,0.038829487900956666,0.13984243106359032,0.1072031513787282,0.021102982554867755,0.0022509848058525606,0.037703995498030385,0.172763083849184,0.0008441193021947102,0.005346088913899831,0.0075970737197523916,0.0014068655036578502,0.015475520540236353,0,0,0.03629712999437254,0.1277433877321328,0.10213843556555993,0,0.018007878446820485,0.011254924029262802,0.04333145751266179,0.1344963421496905,0.13871693866066404,0.004220596510973551,0.019414743950478333,0.009285312324141813,36.46,0,356.205625,26,28,9.46,31,32.43125,1.83,248.55,42,27,31,21.25,36.46,14,141.01999999999998,58.46,615.265,777.2850000000001,141.01999999999998,,0.33798601994456023,0,0.8329958855171994,0.266901309091578,0.2816496663558846,0.11697166885103988,0.3026921509660023,0.3123027891681878,0.024984884729962027,0.776805450505462,0.3703237230179847,0.27435041768624335,0.3026921509660023,0.22932244244767316,0.5234835603955953,0.16390701060277305,0.034217483139360655,0.01418489621562207,0.14928960263607102,0.18860258390283616,-0.9037670432342635,0.8113974160971639,210
174,"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford An architect of regime-change, coups, no-fly zones, rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become Commander-in-Chief, yet the bulk of what passes for the Left is “engaged in a 1930s-style ‘united front’ against a ‘fascism’ that was never a threat in 21 st century America.” Donald Trump, the orange menace, didn’t have a chance of becoming president. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on Earth. Fighting Ghost Fascists While Aiding Real Ones by BAR executive editor Glen Ford “Trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton’s imperial Big Tent.” Hillary Clinton’s impending -- and totally predictable -- landslide victory on November 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a “fascist” white nationalist takeover of the U.S. executive branch of government in 2016. That was always a red (or “orange”) herring, a phony “barbarians at the gate” threat that -- as Wikileaks documents confirmed -- John Podesta and Hillary’s other handlers fervently hoped would convey “lesser evil” status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Hillary camp’s favoring Donald Trump or, alternatively, Ted Cruz. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. By hugging close to the GOP’s flanks, national Democratic candidates can lay claim to a “center-left” spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of U.S. public opinion on most issues. By this calculus, Democrats are supposed to win, unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to “stand up” to the Blacks) and foreign policy (failure to “stand up” to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). Race is the trickiest part of the equation, since white supremacy is embedded in the American political conversation, hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. “His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.” Trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on Wall Street for (white) American job losses and falling living standards. He also calculated -- correctly, it turns out -- that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, many white Americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at Russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. Both of Trump’s central policies backfired, dooming his campaign. His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites, who have given majorities to national Republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not, as individuals, racist. (Certainly, white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) Much more spectacularly, Trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton’s imperial Big Tent. At the national level, the duopoly system, as we had known it, virtually ceased to exist – a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of Donald Trump, the candidacy they had done so much to create. The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election, a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle, including on the moribund electoral level. With the ruling class gathered in one Big Tent, and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the GOP, the system itself was in disarray. What was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class, with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate, had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk, at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire, yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. “The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.” In these pages, we had been saying since last year that Donald Trump could not win; that Bernie Sanders’ fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that, although ruling class money would insure Clinton an election by landslide, it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the Democratic “base,” who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her Big Tent. As we wrote on May 18 of this year: “Outsized fear of Trump is hysteria. These days, the ‘brown shirts’ wear blue. Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street, War and Austerity – not Trump, the racist America Firster. And, he can’t win, anyway – not with tens of millions of ‘moderate’ Republicans and most of the party’s funders rushing into Hillary’s welcoming embrace.” But sadly, hysteria does reign in most of the “left” precincts of America. Those who did not hesitate to kick Hillary when she appeared to be “down” -- in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to Sanders -- are terrified to kick her when she is “up” and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. They are engaged in a 1930s-style “united front” against a “fascism” that was never a threat in 21 st century America, where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and Klansmen) utterly superfluous. These trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism, which is now firmly entrenched in power with Hillary as its champion, in favor of a crusade against an “orange” menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. They have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless -- except, of course, to the fascists-in-charge.

175,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Supreme Court made its most sweeping ruling in decades on abortion rights, striking down parts of a Texas law that imposed strict limits on abortion providers. Opponents of the law, which was passed in 2013, said that it had already caused about half of the state’s abortion clinics to close. The    decision has significant implications for laws in other states where similar restrictions exist they, too, are likely unconstitutional. _____ 2. The court vacated the conviction of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, on corruption charges, a unanimous decision that could send Mr. McDonnell back for another round with prosecutors. “There is no doubt that this case is distasteful it may be worse than that,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote, emphasizing that the justices were more focused on what they considered an overly broad interpretation of the federal bribery law at hand than “tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns. ” _____ 3. In Britain, the path forward remained uncertain after the vote last week to leave the European Union. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who supported “Brexit” and is a contender to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, promised Britons  in an   essay that their country “is part of Europe, and always will be. ” But the nation remained locked in a political crisis, and leaders of the “Leave” movement, including Mr. Johnson, have already disavowed some of their pledges. _____ 4. The pound, meanwhile, sank to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, and S. P. downgraded Britain’s credit rating to AA from AAA as the economic fallout from the Brexit vote continued. Global authorities tried to soothe the markets, promising to intercede in the event of an economic disaster. But investors remained skeptical, and British officials tried to assure citizens that they would still have access to the Continent’s market. _____ 5. Volkswagen has agreed to pay nearly $15 billion to settle claims stemming from its diesel emissions cheating scandal, in one what would be one of the largest ever consumer   deals ever in the U. S. The cash compensation offered to each car owner will range from $5, 100 to  $10, 000. The German automaker acknowledged last year that it had installed illegal software in 11 million cars worldwide that made them capable of defeating pollution tests. 6. Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren campaigned together for the first time on Monday in Cincinnati. Their alliance seems unlikely to some, given their distinct approaches to Wall Street. But those differences did not come into play during the Ohio appearance: The two women showed a united face on income inequality and criticism of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. _____ 7. A police scandal has erupted in Oakland, Calif. with more than a dozen officers coming under investigation for their relationships with an    prostitute who is a daughter of a police dispatcher. The city has long had a reputation for police abuses, but it had seemed to be in the midst of a turnaround under its new mayor, Libby Schaff. She said in a recent interview, “It’s tragic that this scandal has overshadowed the incredible progress that Oakland has made. ” _____ 8. Unfortunately for your briefing editor, spoilers abound in our television critic’s review of the sixth season of HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” which had its finale Sunday night. We can tell you without ruining anything that he found the show to be “faster, simpler and more ” partly because it was the first season to move beyond the plot established by the books. “If this was not the series’s best season, it was its most   entertaining,” he writes. 9. Returning from a visit to Armenia on Sunday night, Pope Francis said that all Christians and the Roman Catholic Church owed the gay community an apology for past mistreatment. Francis’ comments, in response to a question about the recent deadly attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. were applauded by leaders of gay Catholic groups, but some said there was more work to be done. “A statement of remorse is only as good as the change in behavior that follows,” said the head of one leading organization. _____ 10. “Now, what we’ve been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow manage to   disarm and not kill white people every day. ” That comment was part of a powerful speech by the actor Jesse Williams of “Grey’s Anatomy” at the BET Awards on Sunday. The show featured a commanding performance from Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar, and tributes to Prince and Muhammad Ali. But Mr. Williams’s speech, a demand for equal treatment and justice, was the strongest statement of the night. _____ 11. Summer is already in session for many of us, but New York City’s public school students are just now preparing to go on vacation. Tuesday is officially the last day of school, and some students are planning to duck out early. Daily attendance last year at the city’s high schools was 88 percent on the last day, it fell to 74 percent. “I might go to school,” one student told our reporter, a hint that schools may experience a similar drop this year. “I might. ” _____ 12. Students may soon own the streets of New York, but on Sunday afternoon, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was dominated by the walking dead. The Zombie Crawl, an annual event celebrating “all things undead, bloody and  ” celebrated its 10th year. Participants chanted about their lust for brains, drank beer and speculated about their chances of surviving a zombie apocalypse. “If it ever happened in real life, I think I could personally deal with that,” one said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

176,"The European Union (EU) has dramatically increased the size of the “divorce” bill it is demanding the UK pays before leaving the bloc, to 100 billion euros. [The new figure, equivalent £84. 5 billion, reflects stricter demands made by Germany and France, in particular in relation to   farm payments and EU administration fees, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.  European Commission president   Juncker and chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have previously said the UK would be expected to pay around €60 billion (£50. 75 billion). The British Government’s lawyers, however, and a House of Lords committee have said the UK has no legal responsibility to pay the £50 billion bill and the prime minister is opposed to handing over a large amount. David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, reiterated these claims Wednesday morning, as well as implying the escalating demands were merely part of the EU’s negotiating tactics. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Wednesday morning, Mr. Davis said recent comments from his European partners should be “taken with a pinch of salt”. “You have seen in the mixture of gossip and spin there are attempts to shape opinions, try to put across robust points of view,” he said. “This is merely preliminary to negotiations. The simple truth is that this is early manoeuvring. We have to deal with it with equanimity. ” Speaking to ITV Tuesday night, he added: “We’ll not be paying 100 billion. What we’ve got to do is discuss in detail what the rights and obligations are. ” The rising bill reflects a hardening of the EU’s Brexit negotiating stance. According to the Financial Times, the French and Polish governments have pushed for the inclusion of   annual farm payments, whilst the Germans are against granting Britain a share of EU assets. The UK would also be held to guarantees and loans to countries such as Ukraine and Portugal, with Britain being reimbursed as the loans are repaid. Over the period of a decade or more, therefore, the repayments would reduce the net size of the “Brexit bill” to between €55 billion and €75 billion. Mr. Barnier has previously said the UK will not be able to begin discussions on a future trade deal with the bloc, or guarantee the rights of UK citizens in the EU, until the bill is settled.",0,396,20.842105263157894,19,0.3383838383838384,0,0,0,0,97.17509529648258,5.900299289188177,71.92693602693603,34.537972315750096,0.7853535353535354,0.005050505050505051,0.03535353535353535,0.017676767676767676,0.010101010101010102,0.020202020202020204,0.17676767676767677,0,0,0.015151515151515152,0.1111111111111111,0,0.08585858585858586,0.0025252525252525255,0,0.007575757575757576,0.007575757575757576,0.05808080808080808,0.0025252525252525255,0.05303030303030303,0.025252525252525252,0.05303030303030303,0,0,0.015151515151515152,0.012626262626262626,0.08080808080808081,0,0.0025252525252525255,0,0,0,0.010101010101010102,0.03787878787878788,0.0025252525252525255,0.0025252525252525255,0.43686868686868685,0,0.020202020202020204,0.0025252525252525255,0,0.020202020202020204,0.0025252525252525255,0.0025252525252525255,0.012626262626262626,0.005050505050505051,0.005050505050505051,0.012626262626262626,0.047979797979797977,0.015151515151515152,0.007575757575757576,0.0025252525252525255,0,0.0025252525252525255,0.047979797979797977,0.22727272727272727,0.017676767676767676,0.005050505050505051,0.027777777777777776,0.05303030303030303,0.09848484848484848,0.017676767676767676,0.007575757575757576,0.047979797979797977,0.14898989898989898,0.03787878787878788,0.010101010101010102,0,0.030303030303030304,0.10858585858585859,0.005050505050505051,0.007575757575757576,0,0,0.005050505050505051,0,0,0.007575757575757576,0.0707070707070707,0.03787878787878788,0,0.007575757575757576,0,0.05555555555555555,0.12373737373737374,0.13131313131313133,0.007575757575757576,0.06060606060606061,0.0025252525252525255,0,0,7,0,2,0,0,2,1.83,3,3,5,1,0,0,0,18.32,0,11,29.32,18.32,,0,0,0.2642148665478112,0,0.09305100366818048,0,0,0.09305100366818048,0.08582045108059105,0.13337133711281343,0.13337133711281343,0.2041350519664497,0.04879574852141934,0,0.04879574852141934,0,0.044866771159874606,0,0.026939655172413795,0.0718064263322884,0.3468528757674994,0.9281935736677116,17
177,"Arianna Huffington was sitting like a very relaxed queen in her SoHo bedroom on a thronelike bergère chair covered in brocade Fortuny fabric. It was time to wind down, 8 p. m. Behind her, an embroidered throw pillow announced: “Sleep your way to the top. ” The phrase recalls a TED Talk she gave in 2010, and it isn’t about sex, thank you. It is about sleeping. “I was making a speech about sleep as a performance enhancer,” she said. “As opposed to being lazy or not engaged with life. ” One wouldn’t think that about one of the most powerful women in the world, the author of 15 books and a founder of a news site that sold to AOL for $315 million in 2011. But of all the things on her agenda, which would exhaust most mortals, sleep is at the top. Her new book, “The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time” (Harmony) is a call to bed. It is also inspiring a turbocharged national tour that involves “sleep fairs” at colleges and an educational “takeover” of a JetBlue flight during which she gave out books and answered questions. “I want to rekindle our romance with sleep,” said Ms. Huffington, 65, in a lullaby voice as soothing as her floral perfume. “It’s a central part of life and a gateway to our dreams. ” If sleep is a gateway to her dreams, then her bedroom is the mother ship. It is one of four in a vast apartment she transformed a few years ago with the help of the designer Steven Gambrel. “It was a minimalist loft,” she said. “But I wanted something that felt more   and European. ” To achieve that, she hired Mr. Gambrel to add walls to break up the space, for which he also designed much of the furniture. Peter Mucek, the decorative painter, plastered the walls to emulate a golden Venetian glow. Michael S. Smith, who redecorated some rooms in the Obama White House and is a friend, suggested that she treat the loft’s concrete columns with metallic brown paint to give them an ancient bronze feel. Mr. Smith also designed some leather chairs and an ottoman. Her home now has a regal and romantic ambience that seems in perfect keeping with Ms. Huffington’s personality. Everything in the decidedly   bedroom is as carefully considered as a business move. On a bed surrounded with Fortuny curtains in a restful light blue, she sleeps on organic cotton sheets from a collection called Huffington. The Huffington line, carried by   a nearby bedding shop, was designed by her daughter Isabella Huffington, 25, an artist who shares her home. Her pillows are stuffed with soporific hops and barley. Across the room are two Gordon Parks photographs, including the bucolic “Boy With June Bug. ” Over her night stand is a photograph of her other daughter, Christina, now 27, at Isabella’s christening. “I call it a joy trigger,” Ms. Huffington said, “and I like having it right by my bed. ” Her night stand functions as a kind of altar to Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. The books are inspirational, including works by Rumi, the   Persian poet, and Marcus Aurelius, whom Ms. Huffington admires because he was a multitasking Roman emperor and not easily ruffled. There is a simple alarm clock from Pottery Barn without any of the pesky digital lights she bans from her bedroom and from her hotel rooms. (She packs masking tape to obscure their blinking.) Roses and peonies rest in a vase by a journal with a black cover decorated by Isabella. Next to it is a pen light. “So if I wake up in the middle of the night, I can write down my dreams without turning on the light,” she said. Dreams, of course, are welcome business ideas, not so much. On a desk and dresser across the room, which she can’t reach from her bed, Ms. Huffington has several china Herend Rothschild bird bowls to hold such workaday items as   and manuscript clips, and a lacquered box for her packed appointment book. “I hide the whole mess to forget about it,” she said, lifting and setting down lids like a cook. At bedtime, her phone and electronic devices are relegated to the foyer outside the bedroom, to recharge under a wall of family photographs. Withdrawing from her machines, she said, is part of a   “transition to sleep” ritual that includes writing down the many things she is grateful for dimming the lights taking a warm bath in Epsom salts by flickering candlelight and changing into a silk nightgown to greet sleep with respect. “I used to sleep in the same thing I wore during the day,” said Ms. Huffington, whose call to rest came in 2007, when she fell down from exhaustion and broke her cheekbone. “It’s better to have special clothes for sleeping. ” It also helps to have soundproofed windows, which required a complicated and expensive installation process that made her renovated home as quiet as a church. Indeed, her cellphone rings with the sound of cathedral chimes. “I love church bells, don’t you?” she asked in a seductive purr. It was time for a tour of the rest of the apartment. It is one of her two homes and very different from the one she has in California. “My other house is from the 1920s, in Brentwood, in L. A.,” she said as she swept into her living room. “When I step out the door there, it’s into a garden of entirely white flowers, where all I smell is gardenias and it feels like being in the country. Here, it’s children, dogs and people from all over the world on my street when I walk out, and my favorite shops and restaurants. ” Her spacious living area  —   with a custom bookcase, a gilded Louis XV desk, gilded bronze and cobalt   candelabra and a   Italian mirror above the fireplace  —   has the feeling of something between a papal chamber and the Oval Office. “Isn’t this beautiful?” she asks, gesturing to a   screen by Mr. Mucek that hides a small white kitchen area, where she doesn’t concern herself with cooking. Just the same, Ms. Huffington loves to hold the many dinners that she doesn’t prepare at a   faux marble dining table. “I know how to make a really great cheese plate,” she said. She makes tea, too. Near the front door is a portrait of a woman by Françoise Gilot, which Ms. Gilot, who spent 10 years with Picasso, gave Ms. Huffington around the time Ms. Huffington was writing “Picasso: Creator and Destroyer,” published in 1988. The portrait of her daughters is by Nelson Shanks, who also painted Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II and Diana, Princess of Wales. “But what I love most of all are the works of my daughter Isabella,” she said. As if on cue, Isabella emerged from an art studio next to her bedroom. (Christina has her own place.) The two put their arms around each other. The daughter, as it turns out, also respects a good night’s sleep. “Even in college, I’d get nine hours of sleep a night,” said Isabella, who is as tall and graceful as her mother and whose pretty collages have a dark political edge. “Remember when you’d visit, and my friends were pulling   and you’d lecture them about it?” Her mother laughed. No need for that at home.

178,"Sonoma County California Just Voted to Create the Largest GMO Free Zone in America Nov 14, 2016 0 0 Just when it seemed the biotech industry couldn’t get any more gargantuan, with the threat of a Bayer-Monsanto merger , not only were the TTIP and TPP pronounced dead , but Sonoma County California just passed a successful ban on the cultivation on genetically modified crops, creating the largest GMO-Free zone in America . Measure M passed with 55.9% of the vote in favor of banning crop cultivation. The vote transpired on the same day as the U.S. presidential election. The ban will affect a whopping 13,734 square miles bridging Sonoma, Humboldt, Marin, Mendocino, Santa Cruz and Trinity Counties. Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, BASF, and DuPont all descended on Sonoma County to fight Measure M, but local farmers largely wanted an opportunity to grow organic, non-GMO crops without the fear of contamination through cross-pollination. (You can see who supported a ‘yes’ note and who supported a ‘no’ vote, here .) “My right to grow non-GMO should not be threatened by someone else’s business practices that are harmful to mine. Millions of dollars in lost export revenue has occurred from GMO contamination,” says Joey Smith , owner/manager of Let’s Go Farm in Santa Rosa. “Because people growing genetically engineered crops are not required to register, we don’t know exactly how many genetically engineered crops are growing here in Sonoma County.” he explains. “We don’t want GMO crops proliferating here, so that’s why we are taking action. The Measure is carefully written to be fair to all farmers. Measure M is really about being proactive, just like the GMO growing bans in the five other CA counties.” Already, 80% of Sonoma County’s dairy farms are certified organic, and the wine-making industry has been trying to go organic as well. Measure M will make it much easier for farmers growing a multitude of crops to do so without using herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and petroleum-based fertilizers, but also without their hard-earned yield going to waste due to GM contamination. The measure will protect farmland, pastureland, and surrounding green spaces, and hopefully the almost 14 thousand square miles which are now to be GM-free, will eventually expand to cover an even larger area. When this area is tied to others in the U.S. which have smaller GMO-Free zones, we can start to see a patchwork of resistance that has paid off. Connecticut and Maine have passed GMO labeling laws as of May of 2013 , but are still waiting on triggering states for those laws to go into effect. Maui, Hawaii has successfully passed a GMO moratorium which took effect in March of 2015. Both Josephine and Jackson Counties in Oregon have banned GMOs, though they are said to be in conflict with a state law. Vermont fought hard against the GM industry and passed a law that requires ALL GMO food to be labeled as of July 1, 2016. San Juan County in Washington has also banned GM crops. The GMO-Free movement has grown slowly, but surely over the years, and Sonoma’s recent addition of GM-Free lands is a shining example of what grassroots movements can do to fight against the trillion-dollar biotech machine. It isn’t impossible, but it has been hard as heck. Consider purchasing some Sonoma County organic wine or fresh produce over the holidays to toast their successful endeavors.",1,585,23.4,25,0.3299145299145299,0,0,0,0,85.19677544677545,28.582431149097822,45.90138067061144,61.42965154503616,0.7299145299145299,0.018803418803418803,0.05299145299145299,0.046153846153846156,0.04957264957264957,0.008547008547008548,0.1811965811965812,0.010256410256410256,0.005128205128205128,0.018803418803418803,0.06324786324786325,0.0017094017094017094,0.08034188034188035,0.005128205128205128,0,0.023931623931623933,0.008547008547008548,0.09572649572649573,0,0.06837606837606838,0.023931623931623933,0.05641025641025641,0.022222222222222223,0.0017094017094017094,0.035897435897435895,0.010256410256410256,0.06495726495726496,0,0,0.005128205128205128,0,0,0.013675213675213675,0.039316239316239315,0,0,0.4153846153846154,0,0.003418803418803419,0,0.003418803418803419,0.03247863247863248,0.008547008547008548,0.005128205128205128,0.010256410256410256,0.017094017094017096,0.005128205128205128,0.0017094017094017094,0.022222222222222223,0.035897435897435895,0.018803418803418803,0.015384615384615385,0.003418803418803419,0.0017094017094017094,0.02735042735042735,0.26666666666666666,0.005128205128205128,0.0017094017094017094,0.018803418803418803,0.05128205128205128,0.06324786324786325,0.023931623931623933,0.03418803418803419,0.02735042735042735,0.13162393162393163,0.05641025641025641,0.015384615384615385,0,0.013675213675213675,0.13846153846153847,0,0.013675213675213675,0.008547008547008548,0.0017094017094017094,0.010256410256410256,0,0,0.0017094017094017094,0.035897435897435895,0.07863247863247863,0.0017094017094017094,0.015384615384615385,0.005128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.1452991452991453,0.15384615384615385,0.008547008547008548,0.037606837606837605,0.005128205128205128,11,0,46,0,11,0,9,54,4.83,35.75,7.875,5,12,0,11,0,60.705,9,86.75,156.45499999999998,60.705,,0.3297294921503347,0,0.6729014420483272,0,0.3297294921503347,0,0.28698357511928657,0.7071702368171,0.17763439678478482,0.6152053312475864,0.2604538763012001,0.1827439976315568,0.34923639691004144,0,0.4721359549995794,0,0.0877931318740916,0.013016031412022476,0.1254600805547722,0.22626924384088626,-0.6222467120861485,0.7737307561591138,50
179,"Differentiating Wikileaks from journalists, FBI Dir. James Comey calls Wikileaks ”intelligence porn” https:  .  pic. twitter.  Wednesday at the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, FBI Director James Comey said Wikileaks was not journalism, but “intelligence porn. ”  Comey said, “In that there is at least a portion, and people can argue that maybe this conduct Wikileaks is engaged on in the past that is closer to regular news gathering, but in my view, a huge portion of Wikileaks’ activities has nothing to do with legitimate news gathering, informing the public, commenting on important controversies but releasing classified information to damage the United States of America. People start to get cynical about journalists, but American journalists do not do that. ”  “They almost always call us before classifying publishing information to say, is there anything that will jeopardize government people, or innocent civilians anywhere in the world and work with us to try to accomplish their important First Amendment goals by safeguarding the interests. This activity, I’m talking about Wikileaks, involves so much considerations whatsoever,” he continued. “It is intelligence porn, push it out in order to damage. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,191,19.1,10,0.39790575916230364,0,0,0,0,84.38727428144033,39.29312659417372,76.81770585435507,65.44890440178398,0.7591623036649214,0.02617801047120419,0.020942408376963352,0.041884816753926704,0.06282722513089005,0.031413612565445025,0.2094240837696335,0.010471204188481676,0,0.010471204188481676,0.041884816753926704,0,0.06806282722513089,0.015706806282722512,0,0,0.010471204188481676,0.09424083769633508,0.005235602094240838,0.08376963350785341,0.015706806282722512,0.041884816753926704,0,0,0.041884816753926704,0,0.09947643979057591,0,0,0,0,0,0.005235602094240838,0.020942408376963352,0,0,0.42408376963350786,0,0.020942408376963352,0,0.010471204188481676,0.05235602094240838,0.015706806282722512,0,0.015706806282722512,0,0.010471204188481676,0.005235602094240838,0,0.010471204188481676,0.015706806282722512,0.020942408376963352,0.015706806282722512,0,0.005235602094240838,0.14659685863874344,0.005235602094240838,0,0.031413612565445025,0.05235602094240838,0.04712041884816754,0.03664921465968586,0.041884816753926704,0.03664921465968586,0.14659685863874344,0.08900523560209424,0.010471204188481676,0,0.05235602094240838,0.13089005235602094,0,0.010471204188481676,0,0,0.010471204188481676,0,0.015706806282722512,0.005235602094240838,0.13089005235602094,0.07853403141361257,0,0.031413612565445025,0.010471204188481676,0.03664921465968586,0.11518324607329843,0.11518324607329843,0.010471204188481676,0.03664921465968586,0,19,0,20,2,2,6,0,0,1.83,12,1,0,5,0,19,0,26.83,6,27,57.83,26.83,,0.573288342541068,0,0.585786437626905,0.12389934309929541,0.12389934309929541,0.29788301062430306,0,0,0.11457453424581729,0.45902906222806084,0.06604088253131131,0,0.2612038749637414,0,0.4974746830583267,0,0.11573135487210456,0.025881033515938404,0.11646465082172282,0.24945002803778632,-0.016715830875123076,0.7505499719622137,17
180,"Is Audrey Hepburn making a return to the house of Givenchy? On Thursday, the French brand named Clare Waight Keller as its artistic director, responsible for women’s and men’s wear, accessories and couture. She will be the first woman to run the creative side of the house founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952. The announcement marks a new stage in this year’s game of fashion musical chairs, and it is a potentially significant change, both for Givenchy and its incoming designer. The news came less than two months after Ms. Waight Keller, a British designer, officially resigned from Chloé  —   which is owned by Compagnie Financière Richemont, and which announced last week that its new creative director was Natacha  . Ms.   had been creative director of women’s    at Louis Vuitton, a brand that, like Givenchy, is owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. “I am very happy to have Clare Waight Keller join the LVMH group,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, in announcing the news, which was released simultaneously on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WeChat and Weibo. “I believe her widespread expertise and vision will allow Givenchy to enter the next phase of its unique path. ” What that next phase is remains to be seen, but the choice of Ms. Waight Keller, rumored during the recent Paris Fashion Week, suggests the answer is not more of the same. Givenchy’s previous artistic director, Riccardo Tisci, left the brand in February after 12 years. He was responsible for transforming it from the house defined largely by the relationship between Mr. de Givenchy and Ms. Hepburn, his greatest muse, to a house the Kardashians loved, with all the Gothic     buzz that suggests. Mr. Tisci also made it a social media force. By contrast, there is nothing   about Ms. Waight Keller, 46, a   personality often pictured peeking out from under her long brown hair, hands tucked into trouser pockets. As a designer, she has seemed content to let her brands be the stars, and her work, both at Chloé and in her former position as designer of Pringle of Scotland, was marked by a   accessible elegance with a tailored line. Think of it as slouchy chic. Indeed, the statement by Philippe Fortunato, chief executive of Givenchy, seemed to suggest a return to the brand’s roots. “I am very excited to see Clare bring her singular sense of elegance and modernity to Givenchy,” he said. “By exploring our maison’s   heritage and the outstanding   of its ateliers, I am convinced Clare will help Givenchy reach its full potential. ” Though Ms. Waight Keller, who began her career working at Calvin Klein in New York and with Tom Ford at Gucci, was also in charge of men’s wear at Pringle, she has never worked with an haute couture atelier before. Givenchy suspended its formal couture shows in 2012, first holding static presentations of the collection instead, and more recently incorporating some couture looks into its men’s wear shows in January and June. But the fact that Ms. Waight Keller has been specifically given responsibility for the highest form of fashion’s art suggests that a return to a more formal couture offering may be in the future. It also suggests that the idea was false that Ms. Waight Keller, who has three children and has recently moved her family to London from Paris, was taking time off after Chloé because of the pressures of today’s fashion cycle. Her responsibilities at Givenchy, after all, will be significantly greater than her responsibilities at Chloé: She will be overseeing at least eight collections a year, as opposed to four. LVMH does not break down the performance of individual brands in its financial results, but the Givenchy annual sales revenue is believed to be to around 500 million euros, or more than $530 million,) and there are 72   stores worldwide. In January, LVMH reported revenue of €37. 6 billion in 2016, an increase of 5 percent, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe, and a pickup in demand in Asia. Along with the move of Raf Simons to Calvin Klein from Christian Dior, the switch by Ms. Waight Keller should put to rest the recent theory that designers are rebelling against the relentless demands of the system by stepping off the hamster wheel. Perhaps most significantly of all, though, her appointment at the helm of one of LVMH’s signature brands is further indication that the largest luxury group in the world is increasingly focused on the talents of women designers, and changing a historical pattern that has seen most large brands with significant women’s wear profiles run by male creatives. (In June, Christian Dior, the structural owner of LVMH, named Maria Grazia Chiuri as artistic director.) In her new role  —   like Phoebe Philo, the creative director of Céline, another LVMH brand (who, when she was creative director of Chloé, became the first designer to ever take a formal maternity leave)  —   Ms. Waight Keller will move between London and Paris, where the Givenchy atelier is based. It may seem astonishing, but the idea that a designer would not have to choose between having a power position and a family life is a relatively new look in the fashion world. Ms. Waight Keller officially begins work May 2. Her first show for Givenchy will take place during Paris Fashion Week in October. The fashion world will be left to speculate on where Mr. Tisci, whose next move has not yet been announced, will end up. Rumor has it the answer is Versace.

181,"Tweet Widget by Robyn Maynard Canada, including its French-speaking regions, is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor, according to a United Nations Working Group report. Black women’s poverty rates are “almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women.” In Montreal, “a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.” Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard This article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . “ Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.” After holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. The group’s preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canada’s black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. Underlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. The UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. Enslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers — the largest visible minority in the city — continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists Léonel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called “black crime,” that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. “The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834.” A report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montréal-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing “gang activities,” when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. Black women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. Beyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. The UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. If Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN — alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country — need to be both addressed and redressed. Robyn Maynard is an activist and writer living in Montreal, author of the forthcoming book Policing Black Bodies (2017).",1,790,31.6,25,0.35822784810126584,0,0,0,0,94.152903355435,22.442910113796184,66.20433996383363,13.716565767749037,0.7620253164556962,0.01139240506329114,0.05569620253164557,0.02911392405063291,0.015189873417721518,0.020253164556962026,0.1569620253164557,0.0037974683544303796,0.005063291139240506,0.0037974683544303796,0.0620253164556962,0.002531645569620253,0.060759493670886074,0.012658227848101266,0.006329113924050633,0.008860759493670886,0.007594936708860759,0.0670886075949367,0.0037974683544303796,0.06835443037974684,0.03417721518987342,0.049367088607594936,0.021518987341772152,0.0012658227848101266,0.02278481012658228,0.0037974683544303796,0.09367088607594937,0,0,0.0012658227848101266,0.016455696202531647,0,0.002531645569620253,0.03670886075949367,0.0037974683544303796,0.0037974683544303796,0.40253164556962023,0.006329113924050633,0.0037974683544303796,0.005063291139240506,0,0.04177215189873418,0.0037974683544303796,0,0.015189873417721518,0.006329113924050633,0.002531645569620253,0.005063291139240506,0.012658227848101266,0.005063291139240506,0.008860759493670886,0.01139240506329114,0,0.0012658227848101266,0.030379746835443037,0.20759493670886076,0.005063291139240506,0.0037974683544303796,0.05949367088607595,0.03417721518987342,0.06582278481012659,0.015189873417721518,0.002531645569620253,0.056962025316455694,0.15316455696202533,0.056962025316455694,0.02531645569620253,0,0.015189873417721518,0.13670886075949368,0,0,0.005063291139240506,0.0012658227848101266,0.05063291139240506,0.0012658227848101266,0,0.006329113924050633,0.06962025316455696,0.08354430379746836,0,0.016455696202531647,0.005063291139240506,0.049367088607594936,0.09620253164556962,0.09620253164556962,0.0037974683544303796,0.04810126582278481,0,4,0,105.375,0,0,0,0,57.925,0,57.825,14,6,12,0,4,0,26,0,188.925,214.925,26,,0.15174115516527187,0,0.8249457018243808,0,0,0,0,0.7214860752544647,0,0.7211387390149678,0.3850313054275347,0.21156051433186934,0.34923639691004144,0,0.7525397127303936,0,0.027198786515678534,0,0.19763579778748336,0.2248345843031619,-0.9115379445050171,0.7751654156968382,49
182,"Projected as a   selection in the upcoming 2017 NFL draft, Caleb Brantley now may be overlooked after legal authorities charged him with misdemeanor assault for punching a woman in the face. [The      Florida defensive tackle struck a woman who stands    and weighs 120 pounds, with what police described as “the intensity of force far exceeding what was reasonable or necessary. ”  The malicious act, according to The Big Lead, occurred after the woman pushed Brantley for making “crude” remarks to her. Considered by some to be an instant starter in the NFL, Brantley reacted to the push by hitting her so hard she fell unconscious and “sustained dental injuries that displaced a tooth and will require a root canal. ” Some might label Brantley as a good fit for the NFL, but this same kind of cowardly thug behavior prompted the NFL to permanently suspend Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after a 2014 tape showed Rice knocking his   unconscious in an elevator and dragging her out into the hallway. In 2014, Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy was arrested for allegedly assaulting his former girlfriend and threatening to kill her, both misdemeanors. In the same year, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence. In 2015 there were 31 NFL players arrested for a variety of offenses including domestic violence, DUIs, guns and weapons charges, and animal abuse.

184,"(By Deepak Ramola , Uplift Connect ) Rooted in the hearts of many Hindus is the belief that if you breathe your last in Kashi (Varanasi) you attain what is popularly known as ‘Kashi Labh’ or ‘the fruit of Kashi’—moksh or “release from the cycle of rebirth impelled by the law of karma”. Kashi Labh Mukti Bhawan in Varanasi is one of the three guesthouses in the city where people check in to die. The other two are Mumukshu Bhawan and Ganga Labh Bhawan. Established in 1908, Mukti Bhawan is well-known within the city and outside. Bhairav Nath Shukla has been the Manager of Mukti Bhawan for 44 years. He has seen the rich and the poor take refuge in the guesthouse in their final days as they await death and hope to find peace. Shukla hopes with and for them. He sits on the wooden bench in the courtyard, against the red brick wall and shares with me 12 recurring life lessons from the 12000 deaths he has witnessed in his experience as the manager of Mukti Bhawan: People check in to die. 1. Resolve all conflicts before you go Shukla recounts the story of Shri Ram Sagar Mishr, a Sanskrit scholar of his times. Mishr was the eldest of six brothers and was closest to the youngest one. Years ago an ugly argument between the two brothers led to a wall to partition the house. In his final days, Mishr walked to the guesthouse carrying his little paan case and asked to keep room no. 3 reserved for him. He was sure he will pass away on the 16th day from his arrival. On the 14th day he said, “ Ask my estranged brother of 40 years to come see me. This bitterness makes my heart heavy. I am anxious to resolve every conflict.” A letter was sent out. On the 16th day when the youngest brother arrived, Mishr held his hand and asked to bring down the wall dividing the house. He asked his brother for forgiveness. Both brothers wept and mid sentence, Mishr stopped speaking. His face became calm. He was gone in a moment. Shukla has seen this story replay in many forms over the years. “People carry so much baggage, unnecessarily, all through their life only wanting to drop it at the very end of their journey. The trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can,” says Shukla. The trick lies not in not having conflicts but in resolving them as soon as one can. 2. Simplicity is the truth of life “People stop eating indulgent food when they know they are going to go. The understanding that dawns on many people in their final days is that they should’ve lived a simple life. They regret that the most,” says Shukla. A simple life, as he explains, can be attained by spending less. We spend more to accumulate more and thus create more need. To find contentment in less is the secret to having more. 3. Filter out people’s bad traits Shukla maintains that every person has shades of good and bad. But instead of dismissing “bad” people outrightly, we must seek out their good qualities. Harbouring bitterness for certain people comes from concentrating on their negatives. If you focus on the good qualities though, you spend that time getting to know them better or, maybe even, loving them. To find contentment in less is the secret to having more. 4. Be willing to seek help from others To know and do everything by yourself might feel empowering but it limits one from absorbing what others have learnt. Shukla believes we must help others, but more importantly, have the courage to seek help when we’re in need. Every person in the world knows more than us in some respect. And their knowledge can help us, only if we’re open to it. He recounts the incident of an old woman being admitted on a rainy day back in the 80s. The people who got her there left her without filling the inquiry form. A few hours later, the police came to trace the relatives of the old lady who, they said, were runaway Naxalites. Shukla pretended to know nothing. The police left. When the lady’s relatives returned next morning, Shukla asked the leader uninhibitedly, “When you can kill 5-8 people yourself why didn’t you simply shoot your Nani and cremate her yourself? Why did you make me lie and feel ashamed?” The grandson fell to his knees and pleaded for forgiveness saying no one amongst them is capable of helping his religious grandmother attain salvation. He respects that, and is the reason why he brought her to Mukti Bhawan. We must help others, but more importantly, have the courage to seek help when we’re in need. 5. Find beauty in simple things Mukti Bhavan plays soulful bhajans and devotional songs three times a day. “Some people”, he says, “stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments as if they have never heard it before, even if they have. They pause to appreciate it and find beauty in it.” But that’s not true of everyone, he adds. People who are too critical or too proud, are the ones who find it hard to find joy in small things because their minds are preoccupied with “seemingly” more important things. 6. Acceptance is liberation Most people shirk away from accepting what they are going through. This constant denial breeds in them emotions that are highly dangerous. Only once you accept your situation is when you become free to decide what to do about it. Without acceptance you are always in the grey space. When you are not in denial of a problem you have the strength to find a solution. Indifference, avoidance, and denial of a certain truth, Shukla believes, cause anxiety; they develop a fear of that thing in the person. Instead, accept the situation so you are free to think what you want to do about it and how. Acceptance will liberate you and empower you. Stop and admire a note or the sound of the instruments. 7. Accepting everyone as the same makes service easier The secret to Shukla’s unfazed dedication and determination towards his demanding job can be understood via this life lesson. He admits that life would’ve been difficult if he treated people who admit themselves to Mukti Bhavan differently, based on their caste, creed, colour, and social or economic status. Categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well. “The day you treat everyone the same is the day you breathe light and worry less about who might feel offended or not. Make your job easier,” he says. 8. If/When you find your purpose, do something about it To have awareness about one’s calling is great, but only if you do something about it. A lot of people, Shukla says, know their purpose but don’t do anything about realising it, making it come to life. Simply sitting on it is worse than not having a calling in the first place. Having a perspective towards your purpose will help you measure the time and effort you need to dedicate to it, while you’re caught up in what you think you can’t let go or escape. Take action on what truly matters. Categorisation leads to complication and one ends up serving no one well. 9. Habits become values Shukla recommends cultivating good habits to be able to house good values. And building good habits happens over time, with practice. “It’s like building a muscle; you have to keep at it everyday.” Till one doesn’t consistently work towards being just or kind or truthful or honest or compassionate, every single time he is challenged, one cannot expect to have attained that quality. 10. Choose what you want to learn In the vastness of the infinite amount of knowledge available to us it is easy to get lost and confused. “The key lesson here is to be mindful of choosing what you deeply feel will be of value to you,” he says. People might impose subjects and philosophies on you because it interests them and while you must acknowledge their suggestions, the wise thing to do is delve deeper into what rejoices your own heart and mind. With a smile on his face Shukla says, “In the last days of their life a lot of people can’t speak, walk or communicate with others with as much ease as they could, earlier. So, they turn inwards. And start to remember the things that made their heart sing once, things that they cared to learn more about over the course of their life, which enriches their days now.” They start to remember the things that made their heart sing once. 11. You don’t break ties with people; you break ties with the thought they produce You can seldom distance yourself from people you have truly loved or connected with in some way. However, in any relationship, along the way, certain mismatch of ideologies causes people to stop communicating. This never means you are no longer associated with that person. It simply means that you don’t associate with a dominant thought that person brings with him/her, and to avoid more conflict you move away. The divorce, Shukla affirms, is with the thought and never with the person. To understand that is to unburden yourself from being bitter and revengeful. 12. 10 percent of what you earn should be kept aside for dharma Dharma, Shukla doesn’t define as something religious or spiritual. Instead, he says it is associated more with doing good for others and feeling responsible about that. A simple calculation according to him is to keep 10 percent of your income for goodwill. Many people donate or do charitable acts towards the end of their life because death is hard on them. In their suffering, they begin to empathise with others’ suffering. He says those who have the companionship of loved ones, the blessings of unknown strangers, and an all-encompassing goodwill of people exit peacefully and gracefully. That is possible when you don’t cling on to everything you have, and leave some part of it for others.

185,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump and House Republican leaders worked Thursday to win conservative support for legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, offering concessions to speed cutbacks in Medicaid and dismantle more of President Barack Obama’s signature health law. But in a bid to ensure passage of the Republican health care bill in the House, White House and Republican leaders risked losing support in more moderate quarters of their party  —   not only in the narrowly divided Senate, but in an increasingly nervous House. A faster path to Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and potentially smaller tax credits for the working poor could mollify conservatives who are pressing for a smaller government footprint on the health care system, but they would cut deeper into the benefits that many Trump voters have enjoyed under the Affordable Care Act. White House officials have made clear that they are open to supporting amendments that would require a quicker end to the expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 health care law, according to an administration official involved in negotiations with Congress. Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, and other conservatives want to freeze the expansion of Medicaid next year, two years earlier than under the legislation drafted by House Republican leaders. Referring to this change, Mr. Barton said, “The Trump administration is open to it. ” But in an interview, Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said: “I am opposed to that. New Jersey expanded Medicaid. I don’t want that to be eliminated. ” The federal government pays at least 90 percent of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries, and Mr. Lance said, “I would like that to continue for at least several years. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Mr. Trump was now fully engaged. “This president is getting deeply involved,” Mr. Ryan said. “He is helping bridge gaps in our conference. He is a constructive force to help us get to a resolution. ” The political stakes for the president and the speaker could hardly be higher. If they succeed in undoing the Affordable Care Act, it would add momentum to efforts to enact other items on their agenda, such as tax cuts and a rewrite of the tax code. If they fail, it would embolden Democrats keen to block Mr. Trump  —   and conservatives still seeking to imprint their   policies. But they are in a delicate dance with conservatives and moderates. Halting the expansion of Medicaid in 2018, rather than in 2020, “would be a huge problem, enormously problematic,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, one of 31 states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans appeared determined to power through, despite divisions in their ranks. On Thursday, the House Budget Committee approved a motion to send the repeal bill to the full House, where Republican leaders plan to take it up this month. But the    vote in the Budget Committee portends possible difficulties. Three conservative Republicans  —   Dave Brat of Virginia, Gary Palmer of Alabama and Mark Sanford of South Carolina  —   voted no, joining a united Democratic opposition. “This legislation is a conservative vision for     health care,” said Representative Diane Black of Tennessee, the chairwoman of the Budget Committee. “It dismantles Obamacare’s mandates and taxes. It puts health care decisions back in the hands of patients and doctors. ” The Budget Committee endorsed a Republican proposal suggesting that the bill could be improved by imposing work requirements on certain Medicaid beneficiaries  —     adults without minor children. Representative Glenn Grothman, Republican of Wisconsin, said that Medicaid in its current form was “a seductive entitlement” that encourages people “not to work at all, or to work less. ” That change would have to be made later in the legislative process the committee approved a motion directing Ms. Black to seek an amendment authorizing work requirements. Republican leaders acknowledged that they did not yet have the votes to ensure that the full House would pass the repeal bill, but Mr. Ryan said he was “working hand in glove” with Mr. Trump to achieve that goal. Mr. Trump “knows how to connect directly with people,” Mr. Ryan said House passage, Mr. Trump’s aides believe, would force the Senate Republican holdouts to consider whether they would be willing to vote against repeal of a law they have been pledging to undo for seven years. To make opposition even harder for Senate Republicans, Mr. Trump’s aides plan to deploy him to states he won where Republican senators may be uneasy about the current legislation. With no hope of winning support from Democrats, Ms. Black appealed to members of her party. “To my Republican colleagues who have doubts,” Ms. Black said, “I encourage you: Don’t cut off discussion. Stay in this effort and help us enhance this proposal by advancing it out of committee and pushing for further conservative reforms. Members who desire to see this bill improved have every right to make their voices heard. ” Last week, Mr. Ryan appeared to reject major changes sought by conservatives, saying, “It really comes down to a binary choice” between the repeal bill and that status quo. But on Wednesday, after a meeting of the House Republican Conference where Vice President Mike Pence tried to rally support for the legislation, Mr. Ryan opened the door to changes, saying, “We can make some necessary improvements and refinements to the bill. ” The bill would eliminate tax penalties for people who go without insurance and create a new system of tax credits to help people buy private insurance. It would roll back the expansion of Medicaid authorized by the Affordable Care Act and give each state a fixed allotment of federal money to provide health care to   people on Medicaid. Beyond the faster end to the Medicaid expansion and work requirements for some Medicaid beneficiaries, some conservatives are still pressing to limit the size of the tax credit for the purchase of insurance to no more than the amount of federal income taxes a recipient owes. That would further hurt   consumers who may owe little or nothing in income taxes, and under the current proposal would receive financial assistance from the government to help offset insurance costs. Democrats on the Budget Committee found support for their case in a report issued this week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The report estimated that the House Republican bill would increase the number of people without insurance by 14 million next year and by 21 million in 2020. “In just three years,” said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, “the entire gains under the Affordable Care Act will be wiped out. ” Some 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage under the law, which was signed by Mr. Obama seven years ago. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, said: “This is a   bill. It is not a health care bill. ” Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, had previously raised questions about a provision of the bill that would cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood clinics. But on Thursday he said the overall bill was needed to protect people against potential harm from the health law. “Many people across the country are happy with the Affordable Care Act,” Mr. Faso said. “But just as many, if not more, are seeing extraordinary increases in premiums, extraordinary increases in deductibles. They can no longer afford it. ”",0,1235,21.666666666666668,57,0.35384615384615387,0,0,0,0,97.1506968844967,9.46160708158924,69.50433776749566,79.04138551506972,0.8064777327935223,0.03319838056680162,0.04129554655870445,0.017813765182186234,0.055870445344129556,0.014574898785425101,0.15870445344129555,0,0.0032388663967611335,0.004858299595141701,0.07935222672064778,0,0.05263157894736842,0.024291497975708502,0.0016194331983805667,0.012145748987854251,0.006477732793522267,0.08987854251012145,0.0024291497975708503,0.05263157894736842,0.021052631578947368,0.03319838056680162,0,0,0.027530364372469637,0.025910931174089068,0.11659919028340081,0,0.0008097165991902834,0.005668016194331984,0.0032388663967611335,0,0.006477732793522267,0.03076923076923077,0.0008097165991902834,0.0008097165991902834,0.4080971659919028,0.021052631578947368,0.01700404858299595,0.011336032388663968,0.004048582995951417,0.03805668016194332,0,0,0.010526315789473684,0.008906882591093117,0.0024291497975708503,0.01700404858299595,0.04777327935222672,0.01862348178137652,0.012145748987854251,0.012955465587044534,0,0,0.015384615384615385,0.19433198380566802,0.004858299595141701,0,0.032388663967611336,0.05991902834008097,0.11417004048582996,0.025910931174089068,0.042105263157894736,0.0680161943319838,0.15789473684210525,0.06396761133603239,0.017813765182186234,0,0.0340080971659919,0.12064777327935222,0,0.012955465587044534,0.006477732793522267,0.0032388663967611335,0.009716599190283401,0,0.0016194331983805667,0.005668016194331984,0.09068825910931175,0.06963562753036437,0,0.01700404858299595,0.012145748987854251,0.03724696356275304,0.11012145748987855,0.11659919028340081,0.0032388663967611335,0.06639676113360324,0.0008097165991902834,51.75,0,39.9625,2,6,2,14,8,15,61.3775,34,25,100.575,8,51.75,0,222.325,18,131.9625,361.2875,222.325,,0.6051648732285699,0,0.5420379615855492,0.05592233456385257,0.1508906849579797,0.05592233456385257,0.2931084792921141,0.19155305600199451,0.3076046890535781,0.6451188337658139,0.5017421814299382,0.42543136078972155,0.7486663241784053,0.19155305600199451,0.47866182681740893,0,0.1489826859770654,0.01206201888041011,0.08842967591700662,0.24210314701423152,0.791007846280073,0.7578968529857685,104
186,"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” while discussing the Trump administration’s position on North Korea, The Atlantic Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg said he was “not confident yet” that the administration could handle a crisis.  Goldberg said, “I come back to this general conversation about the way the Trump administration does things. On some levels, on Gorsuch, it is smooth, on healthcare they are having a reasonable debate, but the question is, on matters of life and death I am not confident yet that these guys can and a crisis because remember nothing really has happened yet in the Trump administration. There has been no terror attacks, nothing of North Korean magnitude so remains to be seen. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,125,25,5,0.344,0,0,0,0,70.03448275862068,69.14285714285714,46.8,25.774193548387096,0.832,0.016,0.008,0.064,0.032,0.016,0.176,0.008,0.008,0.016,0.088,0,0.104,0.016,0.008,0.016,0.032,0.112,0,0.072,0,0.048,0,0.008,0.032,0.008,0.104,0,0,0.008,0,0,0,0.056,0.008,0.008,0.52,0.008,0.016,0,0.016,0.048,0.008,0,0.024,0,0.008,0.016,0,0.016,0.04,0.016,0.008,0,0,0.168,0.008,0,0.032,0.032,0.056,0.032,0.016,0.072,0.112,0.08,0.008,0,0.048,0.184,0,0.016,0.016,0,0.008,0,0,0.008,0.08,0.128,0,0.016,0.008,0.048,0.144,0.152,0,0.04,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,39,40,1,,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6774193548387096,0,0,0.09090909090909091,0,0.375,0,0.006369426751592357,0,0.2484076433121019,0.25477707006369427,-0.8431129290883156,0.7452229299363058,8

188,"Nuclear tensions between US, Russia reach ‘dangerous’ point 10/31/2016 PRESS TV US-Russian relations have slipped to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, with tensions now spilling over to nuclear pacts and each side accusing the other of cheating, experts say. “I would have to say that, without question, this is the low point in US-Russian relations since the end of the Cold War,” Steven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution, told NPR. The relationship took a turn for the worse two years ago with the conflict in Ukraine and slid lower last year with Russia’s air campaign in Syria, noted Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine. This year, tensions have continued to mount with Russian and US aircraft buzzing each other over the Baltic and Washington accusing Moscow of trying to interfere in the US presidential elections, he added. Bickering over nuclear issues has also increased markedly in recent months. Early this month, Russia moved a battery of nuclear-capable missile launchers within range of three Baltic states, in what US officials said was a gesture to express displeasure with NATO.

(Photo by Reuters) In late October, Russia unveiled images of a new intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed the Satan 2, which, it says, can carry up to 15 separate warheads powerful enough to destroy an area the size of Texas. The US, in September, flew three long-range nuclear bombers over Eastern Europe to participate in NATO military exercises. These developments have worried nuclear arms experts. “We are in a dangerous situation,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told NPR. “Certainly a situation that is much more dire or tense than it was 10 years ago.” In 1987, four years before the Soviet Union collapsed, Washington and Moscow signed a long-negotiated treaty – known as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty – to eliminate their arsenals of nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. “Since May 2013, the Obama administration has repeatedly raised concerns with Russia regarding its lack of compliance with the INF Treaty,” a senior administration official told NPR on condition of anonymity. The official said Washington has called for a rare meeting of the treaty’s Special Verification Commission “in the coming weeks” to try to resolve the matter. “I actually think this is a good step,” Pifer said of the decision. The US claims that an intermediate-range missile being developed by Russia is not in line with the INF Treaty and wants clarification from Moscow. “What the administration has said is that they provided enough information to the Russians so that the Russians could identify the missile in question. The Russians thus far have said no, they haven’t got enough information, so you’re in that kind of war of words,” Pifer added. President Putin speaks during a news conference. (File photo by AFP) The war of words further escalated in early October when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of a Cold War deal with the US to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. “That, I believe, was a little bit of a poke at President Obama, who attaches a lot of importance to the nuclear nonproliferation agenda,” Pifer said. Tensions are bound to mount even further over the next few months as the US and its NATO allies prepare to move thousands of troops as well as heavy military equipment to countries along and near Russia’s border, namely Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

(Photo by European Pressphoto Agency) “This is a gradual sort of escalation of tensions between the two sides that goes beyond discourse and just disagreements over a treaty,” Kristensen said. “It’s getting pretty deep now.” The rising tensions between the two nuclear powers have other experts worried. “We could head into a nuclear conflict which would devastate humanity,” American writer and retired professor James Petras told Press TV earlier this month. “We need to move away from this saber-rattling from Washington into a position that could come to terms with peaceful co-existence, but I don’t see that on the horizon in present or the near future with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump as presidential candidates,” he said.",1,779,26.862068965517242,29,0.3594351732991014,0,0,0,0,98.2087106665516,40.201300813008125,70.52250896374662,4.092995373846489,0.7637997432605905,0.010269576379974325,0.06418485237483953,0.01797175866495507,0.04236200256739409,0.026957637997432605,0.16944801026957637,0.010269576379974325,0.011553273427471117,0.010269576379974325,0.09499358151476252,0,0.043645699614890884,0.006418485237483954,0.0038510911424903724,0.012836970474967908,0.0025673940949935813,0.07445442875481387,0,0.06290115532734275,0.024390243902439025,0.03594351732991014,0.01540436456996149,0.006418485237483954,0.01797175866495507,0.010269576379974325,0.10397946084724005,0,0,0.007702182284980745,0,0,0.007702182284980745,0.0410783055198973,0,0,0.42105263157894735,0.0012836970474967907,0.01540436456996149,0,0.005134788189987163,0.0410783055198973,0.0012836970474967907,0.0012836970474967907,0.019255455712451863,0.007702182284980745,0.006418485237483954,0.0025673940949935813,0.0012836970474967907,0.024390243902439025,0.006418485237483954,0.03209242618741977,0,0.0012836970474967907,0.024390243902439025,0.20154043645699615,0.005134788189987163,0.0038510911424903724,0.03080872913992298,0.037227214377406934,0.04621309370988447,0.03337612323491656,0.010269576379974325,0.05648267008985879,0.16944801026957637,0.07445442875481387,0.012836970474967908,0,0.03465982028241335,0.16559691912708602,0.0012836970474967907,0.008985879332477536,0.005134788189987163,0.005134788189987163,0.007702182284980745,0,0,0.0025673940949935813,0.06290115532734275,0.08729139922978177,0,0.01797175866495507,0.005134788189987163,0.05391527599486521,0.10526315789473684,0.0962772785622593,0.019255455712451863,0.03209242618741977,0.0012836970474967907,3,0,60.5625,0,12,0,4,19,1.83,106.05,2,8,2,0,3,0,32.49,4,161.54999999999998,196.04,32.49,,0.11076982044265109,0,0.7154823902166003,0,0.3325648391995759,0,0.1424339656566283,0.44100727851190513,0.07062040835156615,0.8149343045115026,0.07667774013050205,0.2493517698850324,0.07667774013050205,0,0.46580555618184466,0,0.03504703141180532,0.004314808422506041,0.1742643251639627,0.21146876078702107,-0.8834317345733044,0.788531239212979,48
189,"Geo-Engineering Unlikely to Work, Conservation Group Says Posted on Nov 3, 2016 By Alex Kirby / Climate News Network Biofilm used in research into carbon capture: Doubts persist about geo-engineering. (ENERGY.GOV via Wikimedia Commons) LONDON—The global watchdog responsible for protecting the world ’ s wealth of species, the UN ’ s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geo-engineering. Its bleak conclusion, echoing that reached by many independent scientists, is that the chances are “highly uncertain”. “Novel means”, in this context, describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, and altering the amount of heat from the Sun that reaches the Earth. Some scientists and policymakers say geo-engineering, as these strategies are collectively known, is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement . This is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2°C above their pre-industrial levels, the Agreement’s basic goal. But the CBD says in a report that geo-engineering, while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating, might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects. Many independent analysts have raised similar concerns.Attempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans, in order to remove GHGs, have so far shown disappointing results. One report doubted that geo-engineering could slow sea-level rise . Another said it could not arrest the melting of Arctic ice . A third study found that geo-engineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse . Transboundary impacts The lead author of the CBD geo-engineering report is a British scientist, Dr Phillip Williamson, of the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council . He is an associate fellow in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia , UK. The CBD originally became involved in climate geo-engineering in 2008, because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment (they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters). The CBD’s concern expanded to include other geo-engineering techniques, especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts. Some scientists argue that “geo-engineering” is a hazily-defined term and prefer to speak instead simply of “greenhouse gas removal”. Dr Williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geo-engineering on biodiversity “is not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties”. On greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier ‘overshoot’ of emissions. New risks In some cases, they say, the cure may be worse than the disease: “The large-scale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change.” When it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation, a familiar theme recurs: “There are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of SRM [solar radiation management] techniques, which could present significant new risks to biodiversity.” Time and again, it seems, a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse: if SRM benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperature-induced bleaching (as it may), in certain conditions “it may also increase, indirectly, the impacts of ocean acidification.” There could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the Earth’s protective ozone layer. Dr Williamson and his colleagues believe that geo-engineering is essential—if it can be made to work—because of the diminishing chances that anything else will. “I’m sceptical. That’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible” They write: “It may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2°C limit by emission reduction alone. However, any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing.” Repeatedly, those two words recur: a suggested technique or development will be “highly uncertain”. Most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research, coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geo-engineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation. Dr Williamson told the Climate News Network: “I’m sceptical. That’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible (for all sorts of reasons)” at the scale needed. When the CBD member governments meet in December they are expected to call for more research: a safe option in most circumstances, but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology once seen as very promising.

190,"Gambia Joins South Africa and Burundi in Exodus from International Criminal Court AFP, October 26, 2016 Gambia has announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), accusing the Hague-based tribunal of the “persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans”. The announcement late Tuesday comes after similar decisions this month by South Africa and Burundi to abandon the troubled institution, set up to try the world’s worst crimes. Information Minister Sheriff Bojang said in an announcement on state television that the court had been used “for the persecution of Africans and especially their leaders” while ignoring crimes committed by the West. He singled out the case of former British prime minister Tony Blair, who the ICC decided not to indict over the Iraq war. {snip} The withdrawal, he said, “is warranted by the fact that the ICC, despite being called International Criminal Court, is in fact an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans”. The ICC, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against Africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the United States, which has signed the court’s treaty but never ratified it. Gambia has been trying without success to use the court to punish the European Union for deaths of thousands of African migrants trying to reach its shores. {snip} South Africa’s decision followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country despite being the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. Earlier this month, Burundi said it would leave the court, while Namibia and Kenya have also raised the possibility. {snip}",1,282,28.2,10,0.375886524822695,0,0,0,0,98.09191921449431,20.04373522458629,54.24549918166939,1.295056320400501,0.6985815602836879,0.01773049645390071,0.02127659574468085,0.028368794326241134,0.03900709219858156,0.010638297872340425,0.15602836879432624,0.01773049645390071,0.010638297872340425,0.010638297872340425,0.10638297872340426,0,0.04964539007092199,0.0070921985815602835,0,0.010638297872340425,0.024822695035460994,0.09574468085106383,0,0.06028368794326241,0.01773049645390071,0.04609929078014184,0.0070921985815602835,0.010638297872340425,0.02127659574468085,0.0070921985815602835,0.09574468085106383,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04609929078014184,0,0,0.425531914893617,0.0070921985815602835,0.010638297872340425,0,0,0.03546099290780142,0,0,0.014184397163120567,0.010638297872340425,0.0035460992907801418,0.0070921985815602835,0,0.014184397163120567,0.010638297872340425,0.03546099290780142,0,0,0.014184397163120567,0.15602836879432624,0.02127659574468085,0.0035460992907801418,0.01773049645390071,0.031914893617021274,0.03546099290780142,0.010638297872340425,0.0035460992907801418,0.06028368794326241,0.15602836879432624,0.04609929078014184,0,0,0.02127659574468085,0.13829787234042554,0.0070921985815602835,0.0035460992907801418,0.010638297872340425,0.0035460992907801418,0.0070921985815602835,0,0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0425531914893617,0.07092198581560284,0,0.01773049645390071,0.0035460992907801418,0.05319148936170213,0.09219858156028368,0.1099290780141844,0,0.014184397163120567,0,0,0,49,1,0,0,0,9,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,105,105,0,,0,0,0.776026967031887,0.06604088253131131,0,0,0,0.38890101355948364,0,0.7893701847229818,0,0,0,0,0.6935092961657883,0,0,0,0.2916666666666667,0.2916666666666667,-0.9130434782608695,0.7083333333333333,27
191,"What Peyton Manning does on Sunday morning has become an intense topic of conversation, at least since Lionel Richie serenaded the   Hall of Famer while he purchased groceries from an unimpressed cashier in his bathrobe. [However, wisely, Manning didn’t wear his bathrobe this past Sunday. That’s because the Super Bowl champion   had a tee time with President Trump.  Manning played with the president at the Trump National Golf Club, along with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, and also visited the White House. Rumors have swirled around Manning and his potential political future for some time, specifically about what will happen in 2020 if the other Volunteer State senator, Lamar Alexander, decides to retire. Manning, a man who could probably invent an office for himself in Tennessee and get unanimously elected to it, is a likely choice to fill the seat. Though, in the past, Manning has denied reports that he’s considering a life in politics, saying, “I don’t know where that came from. Last week I was going to run a team, this week I going to apparently run for Senate, and next week I’ll be an astronaut. I have no interest in the political world, but would like to continue serving communities. ” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0,213,21.3,10,0.3380281690140845,0,0,0,0,84.78440484174891,57.06235704827254,51.87793427230047,69.98960429242119,0.8309859154929577,0.018779342723004695,0.03755868544600939,0.04225352112676056,0.03286384976525822,0.023474178403755867,0.16901408450704225,0,0,0.023474178403755867,0.08450704225352113,0,0.08450704225352113,0.014084507042253521,0.004694835680751174,0.009389671361502348,0.004694835680751174,0.10328638497652583,0.004694835680751174,0.07981220657276995,0.004694835680751174,0.051643192488262914,0,0,0.028169014084507043,0.014084507042253521,0.08450704225352113,0,0,0,0,0,0.028169014084507043,0.04225352112676056,0,0,0.4694835680751174,0.004694835680751174,0.004694835680751174,0.014084507042253521,0.023474178403755867,0.046948356807511735,0.004694835680751174,0.004694835680751174,0.028169014084507043,0.018779342723004695,0.03286384976525822,0.03286384976525822,0.004694835680751174,0.03286384976525822,0.014084507042253521,0.004694835680751174,0.004694835680751174,0,0.004694835680751174,0.22535211267605634,0.009389671361502348,0,0.009389671361502348,0.04225352112676056,0.08450704225352113,0.051643192488262914,0.028169014084507043,0.046948356807511735,0.14084507042253522,0.09859154929577464,0.009389671361502348,0,0.009389671361502348,0.18309859154929578,0,0.004694835680751174,0,0,0.004694835680751174,0,0,0.028169014084507043,0.07042253521126761,0.07511737089201878,0,0.028169014084507043,0,0.07511737089201878,0.1643192488262911,0.1596244131455399,0,0.046948356807511735,0,15.2,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,5,3,1,5,0,15.2,0,19.2,4,11,34.2,19.2,,0.5180263698224726,0,0.06604088253131131,0.2204812092115424,0,0,0,0,0.06604088253131131,0.2612038749637414,0.1750073658177636,0.06604088253131131,0.2612038749637414,0,0,0,0.0812870448772227,0.01693480101608806,0.04657070279424217,0.14479254868755295,0.4505494505494505,0.855207451312447,11
192,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said on Monday that he had urged   Donald J. Trump to reach out to minority groups, women and others who were alienated by his campaign, during the president’s first news conference since Mr. Trump won the election in a stunning upset that has imperiled Mr. Obama’s legacy. “There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t always translate into good policy, and that’s something that I think that he and his team will wrestle with,” Mr. Obama said in the White House briefing room. “I did say to him, as I’ve said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and the ferocity of the campaigns, that it’s really important to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups, or women, or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign, and I think that’s something that he will want to do. ” Mr. Obama also said he thought that Mr. Trump was entering office with fewer set policy ideas than other  . “I don’t think he is ideological,” Mr. Obama said. “I think ultimately he is pragmatic. ” Mr. Obama, who during the campaign called Mr. Trump temperamentally unfit and dangerously unqualified to be president, has since said his priority is to lead an orderly transition of power to help Mr. Trump succeed for the good of the country. He sidestepped a question about Mr. Trump’s actions since his victory, including his selection on Sunday of Stephen K. Bannon, a media mogul whose website, Breitbart. com, has promoted white nationalist, racist and   views, as his chief White House strategist and senior counselor. “Without copping out, I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment” on Mr. Trump’s personnel decisions, Mr. Obama said. The president remarked last week that Mr. Trump’s comments and behavior had been more statesmanlike since the election, saying that he had been “encouraged” by the change in tone. Since then, the   has used Twitter to complain about postelection protests against him and object to the way The New York Times has covered him. Mr. Trump’s elevation of Mr. Bannon, who was a top adviser to the campaign, has drawn scathing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who warn that the   is placing a divisive figure with fringe views deep inside the West Wing. White House officials say Mr. Obama has not changed his view of Mr. Trump since the campaign this fall, when he condemned Mr. Trump as a bigot who had cozied up to white supremacists and could not be trusted with the nuclear codes. But Mr. Obama has told the American public that he believes the will of the voters should be respected. During a      meeting on Thursday in the Oval Office, the president tutored Mr. Trump, who has no government policy or elective experience, on a wide range of domestic and foreign policy matters he will have to deal with on his first day in office. Mr. Obama held the news conference just before departing for a weeklong trip to Greece, Germany and Peru  —   his final scheduled trip abroad as president  —   where he expected to face questions from anxious American allies. For months, Mr. Obama assured the allies that Mr. Trump would not win the White House. Now, he said on Monday, he will tell European allies that they should not fear for the future of NATO under a Trump presidency. In the Oval Office conversation on Thursday, Mr. Obama said, Mr. Trump “expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, and so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the   alliance. ”",0,632,28.727272727272727,22,0.27689873417721517,0,0,0,0,85.96034029261877,7.835680751173708,84.82097649186257,39.944985394352486,0.8164556962025317,0.020569620253164556,0.04272151898734177,0.0189873417721519,0.04430379746835443,0.022151898734177215,0.18037974683544303,0.006329113924050633,0.004746835443037975,0.020569620253164556,0.0759493670886076,0.0015822784810126582,0.08069620253164557,0.0031645569620253164,0.0015822784810126582,0.0189873417721519,0.006329113924050633,0.08860759493670886,0,0.058544303797468354,0.014240506329113924,0.05063291139240506,0,0,0.02689873417721519,0.011075949367088608,0.13765822784810128,0,0,0,0.0031645569620253164,0,0.014240506329113924,0.04272151898734177,0,0,0.4762658227848101,0,0.023734177215189875,0.00949367088607595,0.014240506329113924,0.056962025316455694,0.0031645569620253164,0.0015822784810126582,0.0189873417721519,0.014240506329113924,0.004746835443037975,0.08227848101265822,0,0.0189873417721519,0.014240506329113924,0.01740506329113924,0.0031645569620253164,0,0.004746835443037975,0.20094936708860758,0.004746835443037975,0,0.04113924050632911,0.07436708860759493,0.056962025316455694,0.060126582278481014,0.02531645569620253,0.09335443037974683,0.14715189873417722,0.11708860759493671,0.00949367088607595,0,0.022151898734177215,0.11867088607594936,0,0.014240506329113924,0.004746835443037975,0,0.014240506329113924,0,0,0.04272151898734177,0.15664556962025317,0.0490506329113924,0,0.014240506329113924,0.0015822784810126582,0.05063291139240506,0.125,0.13449367088607594,0.0015822784810126582,0.04430379746835443,0,30,0,25,2,8,6,7,27,6.83,38.125,12,8,19.125,0,30,0,68.955,13,90.125,164.07999999999998,68.955,,0.5885101980389327,0,0.5437598698104011,0.08704668331836253,0.2760888715617666,0.22241846975351037,0.250212886812842,0.5627793148377791,0.24562887623815644,0.645080215976206,0.3638990660839066,0.2760888715617666,0.4769186704283961,0,0.22241846975351037,0,0.0914425525143221,0.01723955018035222,0.11951649692340337,0.21758964566093783,-0.5880164038848836,0.7824103543390621,42

194,"LONDON  —   A woman has made medical history by giving birth after having had an ovary removed and its tissue frozen at age 9, before reaching puberty. Moaza   now 24, was born with beta thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder that was treated with chemotherapy and a   transplant when she was a child. Because chemotherapy damages ovaries, her parents had authorized the removal of her right ovary in advance at the University of Leeds. The medical community celebrated the birth of Ms. Matrooshi’s baby boy on Tuesday in London at the Portland Hospital for Women and Children, saying the event could pave the way to restoring fertility to women who suffer cancer and other illnesses at an early age. Until now, many prepubescent girls who have undergone chemotherapy have had to abandon hopes of bearing children as adults. Professor Helen Picton, who leads the division of reproduction at the University of Leeds and who oversaw the preservation of the tissue, said that the outer part of the ovary that contained eggs was cut into pieces. The pieces were then placed in liquid nitrogen, she said in a telephone interview, and gradually cooled to a temperature of minus 320 Fahrenheit (minus 196 degrees Celsius) where they remained for 14 years. The technology was unproved at the time. It would be another three years before the first live birth from preserved adult ovarian tissue, and the prospect of its working in a girl well before puberty was even more uncertain, Professor Picton said. Last year, surgeons in Denmark transplanted five slivers of the thawed ovarian tissue back into Ms. Matrooshi’s body. Four slivers were grafted onto her failed left ovary, which had been damaged by the chemotherapy, and one sliver was grafted onto the side of her uterus. “We waited and the ovarian tissue started to get revascularized,” Professor Picton said. The cryopreservation had protected the tissue’s integrity, she said, “and when the tissue was thawed, it was alive. ” After the procedure, eggs started to grow in the transplanted tissue, and as Ms. Matrooshi’s hormones returned to normal she began ovulating. Until then, she had been in menopause. Doctors stimulated the ovary with   hormone for in vitro fertilization and retrieved eight eggs, ultimately implanting two embryos in her womb earlier this year. “It’s like a miracle,” Ms. Matrooshi told the BBC. Sue Matthews, a gynecologist, treated Ms. Matrooshi at Portland Hospital. “The pregnancy was totally uncomplicated and a healthy boy Rashid was delivered by ” Dr. Matthews said via email. “Mum and baby ecstatic and all well. ” She said she still had one embryo in storage and kept two pieces of tissue “in the freezer so we can repeat the process if we need to. ” More than 60 women have so far given birth after having preserved ovarian tissue reimplanted in their bodies, Professor Picton said. But Ms. Matrooshi is thought to be the first to have had her tissue frozen before she reached puberty. In Europe alone, thousands of girls and women have had their ovarian tissue frozen and stored, Professor Picton said. The latest breakthrough, she said, “significantly increases our understanding of fertility preservation and how freezing ovarian tissue from a little girl can safeguard the future fertility of young girls. ” In another   case, British regulators have cleared the way for doctors to offer a procedure to create a baby from the DNA of two women and one man. The purpose is to overcome flaws in a parent’s mitochondria that can lead to incurable diseases. As the genetic flaw is passed through the mother, DNA from an egg of the mother replaces the DNA in the egg of a healthy donor, yielding an egg with the mother’s DNA and the donor’s mitochondria. That egg is then fertilized. The procedure, performed successfully in New York earlier this year, is controversial because it involves combining genetic material from two different people.",0,654,21.8,30,0.35015290519877673,0,0,0,0,95.65909971397248,10.910796033731812,89.20967472894078,28.315086646279305,0.7874617737003058,0.01834862385321101,0.039755351681957186,0.022935779816513763,0.02599388379204893,0.012232415902140673,0.14831804281345565,0,0.0015290519877675841,0.012232415902140673,0.09938837920489296,0,0.07033639143730887,0.06422018348623854,0.027522935779816515,0.013761467889908258,0.0030581039755351682,0.035168195718654434,0,0.05504587155963303,0.027522935779816515,0.0581039755351682,0,0.0015290519877675841,0.00764525993883792,0.00764525993883792,0.06422018348623854,0,0.01529051987767584,0.00764525993883792,0.05504587155963303,0,0.00764525993883792,0.07339449541284404,0,0,0.44801223241590216,0.027522935779816515,0.01834862385321101,0,0,0.03211009174311927,0.0030581039755351682,0.010703363914373088,0.0030581039755351682,0.013761467889908258,0.0015290519877675841,0.0045871559633027525,0.0015290519877675841,0.01529051987767584,0,0.012232415902140673,0,0.0030581039755351682,0.03058103975535168,0.21406727828746178,0.0015290519877675841,0.0015290519877675841,0.027522935779816515,0.05657492354740061,0.03058103975535168,0.03363914373088685,0.013761467889908258,0.035168195718654434,0.14831804281345565,0.06574923547400612,0.01529051987767584,0,0.021406727828746176,0.1559633027522936,0,0.0045871559633027525,0.0045871559633027525,0.0061162079510703364,0,0,0.021406727828746176,0.022935779816513763,0.12538226299694188,0.06574923547400612,0,0.0045871559633027525,0.0045871559633027525,0.0764525993883792,0.12232415902140673,0.1162079510703364,0.0061162079510703364,0.02599388379204893,0,12,0,20,2,21.65,0,0,6,7,26.875,16.325,16,14,0,12,0,70.65,0,63.875,134.525,70.65,,0.3288130902060995,0,0.4494897427831781,0.07548623297930128,0.4691743010992596,0,0,0.19675422795565725,0.22225822503597545,0.5231663161826628,0.3999275115490444,0.39511150827124564,0.3636845643308043,0,0.6423836176462587,0,0.094134106125712,0,0.08510709170247494,0.17924119782818695,0.28117273886561694,0.8207588021718131,38
195,"STORRS, Conn.  —   After losing to Connecticut by 61 points in the first round of the N. C. A. A. tournament, Albany’s coach suggested that the Huskies were not only the best women’s basketball team in the country but also the fittest. “I think we’re as in shape a team that you’re going to come across,” said the coach, Joanna  . Yet, she added, “At times they just made us look bad in the way they pushed the ball. ” Robust conditioning is a particular imperative, and a stealth weapon, for a UConn team ( ) that rotates only seven players  —   five starters and two reserves  —   as it seeks a fifth consecutive national championship. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, UConn has won 109 consecutive games with an approach that is, in some ways, decidedly  . For instance, the Huskies do not use devices like   monitors, GPS tracking systems or other wearable technology designed to gauge fitness, enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury. “I’m not a big data guy,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said, adding with a laugh, “I’m not smart enough. ” Instead, the most dominant team in basketball places a premium on rigorous and varied preseason workouts, nutrition, sustained weight training through the season and, especially, on intense practices meant to simulate game conditions. The team relies heavily on the experience and intuition of Auriemma, UConn’s coach of 32 seasons, a Hall of Famer with nearly 1, 000 career wins, in knowing when to push hard in training and when to ease up. He firmly believes that, while weight training and   conditioning are vital, “nothing gets you ready to play basketball like playing basketball. ” Auriemma has 11 national championships  —   and is four victories shy of his 12th  —   to validate his theory. UConn faces U. C. L. A. on Saturday in the semifinals of the Bridgeport (Conn.) Regional. “The reason we’re fit is that we practice at an intensity that no one else does,” said Amanda Kimball, the team’s longtime strength and conditioning coach. “To maintain that intensity, it’s important to make sure we’re doing the right things in the weight room. ” UConn’s brisk,   practices are designed to prepare the regulars to play 30 or more of a game’s 40 minutes and to make quick and correct decisions when they are tired  —   to be able to hit a shot, make an intricate pass and guard the opponent’s top scorer in the closing minutes. “Their expectations are what you think you can’t do,” said Kyla Irwin, a freshman forward. To speed the pace of practices, a   shot clock is sometimes used instead of the   version used in games. Other times, four defenders hustle to guard six or seven shooters stationed around the perimeter and in the lane. One drill, involving three players at a time, requires each to run the length of the court, make a shot and return to the opposite baseline within 10 seconds. A similar drill, which includes an additional sprint to midcourt and back, must be completed within 17 seconds. As do other top women’s teams, UConn also trains against male players who are not of varsity caliber but who might have had college careers at smaller programs. And there is much less stopping for instruction than when Auriemma, 63, was a younger coach. He now prefers continuous movement, comparing his practices to preparing a car for racing. “We’re going to push this car to the limit so that when race day comes, we know what the limit is,” he said. “We do that every day. ” In the drill UConn calls Kansas, five players run the length of the court four times, rehearsing plays and fast breaks, and when they are winded, they conclude the exercise against a live defense. The drill can be repeated for 15 or 20 minutes. The   drill is a      exercise that lasts for five minutes as players rotate in and out. Afterward, the team runs from sideline to sideline for 30 or 60 seconds and immediately proceeds to a shooting drill called “35,” where the ball is not allowed to touch the court. “We do things to get us tired, and then when we get tired, we do things that require us to be mentally smart,” said Kia Nurse, a junior guard who has hit a remarkable 15 of 19   attempts in this N. C. A. A. tournament. Compared to practice, Nurse said, “The game is much easier. ” As the fourth quarter begins, she added: “That’s when your   kicks in that we’re not tired. The other team might give up, but there’s no chance that we are. ” Ideally, Auriemma would use eight players in his regular rotation, to keep his team operating efficiently and his stars satisfied with their playing time. A pet saying of his, attributed to Red Auerbach, the legendary Boston Celtics coach, is, “If you can’t win with eight, you can’t win with 88. ” For various reasons, including an N. C. A. A. rule that has required two transfers to sit out this season before becoming eligible, the current UConn team has only seven players whom Auriemma trusts to play regularly. Several began fall practice recovering from injury or surgery. None had been asked until this season to regularly make decisive plays at critical moments. So proper fitness has become even more urgent. Chris Dailey, Auriemma’s top assistant coach for three decades, said the Huskies once tended to lift weights in the preseason and stop when the regular season began. Now, the players lift at least twice a week through the season to build or maintain strength. At this time of year, given the inevitable wear and tear after   games, weight training shifts from a focus on squats to dead lifts, using a chassislike device called a trap bar, to ease the stress on the players’ backs. “That’s why we always look so good at the end, because we’re still getting stronger, or at least maintaining, where other teams are not lifting, possibly, or they’re backing off because they want to stay fresh for the tournament,” said Kimball, the strength and conditioning coach. Because UConn’s season regularly extends to the Final Four in April, Kimball said, “I can’t detrain them the whole month of March. ” Twice a day, at breakfast and dinner, players are required to answer a brief questionnaire on an iPad. How much did you sleep? Are you sore? Where? Did you eat lunch? How difficult was practice? Are you fatigued? Meals are designed by Kimball and catered so that she can make sure players are getting the right nutrients. An hour before each game, players drink a shake with   carbohydrates it is designed to bolster their energy and stabilize   levels. For recovery after weight training, Kimball is a proponent of tart cherry juice to help reduce joint and muscle pain. She is also a massage therapist, which gives her additional interactions with players, and more chances to gauge their fitness. “All this sports science is going on, but a lot of what we do is art,” Kimball said. “It comes from basically communicating with players. I see them multiple times a day. ‘Hey, how are you doing? You feel good? Not so good?’ It’s just a lot of communication, a lot of trust. ” For training in the   and preseason, Kimball also has devised a diverse set of workouts: sprints using weighted sleds, spin classes, yoga and pool exercises that include running, plyometrics and relay races. At some point, Kimball wants to incorporate GPS technology, she said, but she noted that it “doesn’t measure heart and intensity and passion to win. ” “It doesn’t measure,” she said, “that these girls might want it more than the other guys. ”",0,1304,15.902439024390244,82,0.28067484662576686,0,0,0,0,86.24092138856076,27.47764144512611,74.53255491787057,62.13292433537832,0.8274539877300614,0.032208588957055216,0.04294478527607362,0.03834355828220859,0.04217791411042945,0.03144171779141104,0.21319018404907975,0.0023006134969325155,0.003067484662576687,0.02530674846625767,0.08819018404907976,0,0.06134969325153374,0.03374233128834356,0.005368098159509203,0.018404907975460124,0.00843558282208589,0.08665644171779141,0.0015337423312883436,0.08205521472392638,0.026840490797546013,0.06365030674846625,0,0.0007668711656441718,0.032975460122699383,0.006901840490797546,0.09125766871165644,0,0,0.009202453987730062,0.00843558282208589,0,0.00843558282208589,0.027607361963190184,0.0015337423312883436,0.0015337423312883436,0.455521472392638,0.019938650306748466,0.012269938650306749,0.0015337423312883436,0.003834355828220859,0.04141104294478527,0.0015337423312883436,0.009969325153374233,0.012269938650306749,0.019171779141104295,0.04371165644171779,0.009969325153374233,0,0.024539877300613498,0.014570552147239263,0.011503067484662576,0.0007668711656441718,0,0.0352760736196319,0.24616564417177914,0.004601226993865031,0.0015337423312883436,0.02607361963190184,0.05674846625766871,0.06825153374233128,0.05138036809815951,0.03067484662576687,0.026840490797546013,0.12576687116564417,0.09279141104294479,0.02147239263803681,0.006901840490797546,0.03450920245398773,0.14570552147239263,0,0.016104294478527608,0.009969325153374233,0.0015337423312883436,0.003834355828220859,0,0.0007668711656441718,0.013803680981595092,0.09279141104294479,0.059049079754601226,0,0.019171779141104295,0.009202453987730062,0.06671779141104295,0.1334355828220859,0.13266871165644173,0.013803680981595092,0.03144171779141104,0.010736196319018405,56.955,7,32.525,23,30.175,7.5,17,8,40.455,31.3,22.83,31.375,36.5,25,56.955,11.625,193.835,43.1,123.82499999999999,353.46000000000004,193.835,,0.5844420902195907,0.14737799763572107,0.445414238790712,0.36222233090959766,0.4269730154675185,0.15626004796827075,0.29566804505163874,0.16495895158697044,0.499741121235803,0.43595188832581416,0.36051022782708525,0.43654048554463676,0.47404497607184676,0.3816973759269255,0.5371618053712492,0.22303478954843248,0.125992875992876,0.028015028015028014,0.08048633048633047,0.22974922974922976,0.7097120409047977,0.7702507702507703,119
196,"EU Refugees wait to disembark from a ship on October 24, 2016, in Palermo, Italy. (Photo by AFP) More than 5,200 refugees have died across the world since the beginning of 2016, says the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The organization, which is based in Geneva, said on Friday that of a total of 5,238 deaths, 3,930 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat, indicating a 170-person increase compared to 2015. On Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) made a different account with more than 3,800 deaths in the Mediterranean since January, also noting that it was a new record compared to 2015. Over 280 asylum seekers trying to reach the European Union died off the Libyan shores recently, according to the IOM. The EU said on Thursday it had begun training the Libyan coast guard how to curb the influx of asylum seekers. “Today we are starting the training of the Libyan coast guard in Operation Sophia which is a very important step,” said the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, as she arrived for a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance had just launched its own Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean to help support Operation Sophia. The EU launched Operation Sophia last year after hundreds of asylum seekers died when their rickety boats sank off southern Italy. The central Mediterranean route has seen more asylum seekers risk their lives in recent months after the EU reached an accord with Turkey in March to halt an influx of refugees crossing the Aegean to reach Europe. Stoltenberg further said within two weeks ships and aircraft would be provided by NATO allies to help back up Operation Sophia.

198,"LUXEMBOURG  —   Signs of testy relations between Turkey’s embattled government and the United States continued Sunday, as Secretary of State John Kerry denounced any suggestion of American involvement in Friday’s coup. “We think it’s irresponsible to have accusations of American involvement,” Mr. Kerry told CNN Sunday President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has accused Fethullah Gulen, a reclusive cleric now living in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating the violence, and Mr. Erdogan demanded that Mr. Gulen be extradited. Mr. Gulen has denied the charge, and Mr. Kerry said the Justice Department would examine any evidence Turkey presented as part of an extradition request. Suleyman Soylu, Turkey’s labor minister, had accused the United States of being behind the coup. In a phone call on Saturday with the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Mr. Kerry urged restraint by the Turkish government and said that “public insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations,” according to a description of the call released by the State Department. On Sunday, Mr. Kerry expressed concerns that Mr. Erdogan might use the coup to undertake a   purge within the government of those who may disagree with him. “Obviously, there are coup plotters, and the coup plotters need to be held accountable and they will be,” Mr. Kerry said on ABC. “But I think we’re all concerned, and we have expressed that concern, that this not fuel a reach well beyond those who engaged in the coup but that they strengthen the democracy of the country, strengthen the process, and use it as a moment to unite the nation. ” On NBC, Mr. Kerry said an extensive purge “would be a great challenge to his relationship to Europe, to NATO and to all of us, and we have urged them not to reach out so far that they’re creating doubts about their commitment to the democratic process, and I hope it won’t result in that. ”",0,336,33.6,10,0.33035714285714285,0,0,0,0,92.98831081728466,2.81677218093403,87.70845481049562,41.93956043956044,0.7380952380952381,0.011904761904761904,0.017857142857142856,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.026785714285714284,0.17857142857142858,0,0.002976190476190476,0.020833333333333332,0.08928571428571429,0,0.0625,0.008928571428571428,0,0.011904761904761904,0.011904761904761904,0.08630952380952381,0,0.06845238095238096,0.008928571428571428,0.05654761904761905,0,0,0.01488095238095238,0.011904761904761904,0.13392857142857142,0,0,0,0,0,0.01488095238095238,0.023809523809523808,0,0,0.44642857142857145,0.002976190476190476,0.017857142857142856,0,0.005952380952380952,0.047619047619047616,0.002976190476190476,0.005952380952380952,0.017857142857142856,0.005952380952380952,0.008928571428571428,0.03571428571428571,0.002976190476190476,0,0.008928571428571428,0.01488095238095238,0,0.002976190476190476,0,0.15178571428571427,0.002976190476190476,0,0.017857142857142856,0.05654761904761905,0.047619047619047616,0.041666666666666664,0.023809523809523808,0.08928571428571429,0.14583333333333334,0.08928571428571429,0.017857142857142856,0,0.02976190476190476,0.0744047619047619,0.005952380952380952,0.002976190476190476,0.008928571428571428,0.002976190476190476,0,0,0,0.005952380952380952,0.12797619047619047,0.050595238095238096,0,0.023809523809523808,0.011904761904761904,0.023809523809523808,0.09821428571428571,0.11011904761904762,0.017857142857142856,0.02976190476190476,0,12,0,41.775,1,0,0,5,19,1,35,5,0,15,0,12,0,28,5,85.775,117.775,28,,0.45902906222806084,0,0.7470876241069634,0.06604088253131131,0,0,0.2612038749637414,0.573288342541068,0.06604088253131131,0.7122197591896748,0.2612038749637414,0,0.5147186257614297,0,0.38890101355948364,0,0.06654387736914028,0.011882835244489336,0.20385003861921458,0.2799001841839463,-0.8524529693839912,0.7200998158160536,33
199,"STEPHEN MILLER: In a world with 7 billion people, the U. S. has an absolute sovereign right to determine who can and cannot enter the country pic. twitter.  Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller defended President Donald Trump’s executive order halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  Miller explained there was precedent for Trump’s action and that the United States is a nation with an “absolute sovereign right” to determine who can come to the United States and who can’t. “This is an authority that has been used repeatedly in the past,” Miller said. “One of the more recent examples is President Obama suspended the Iraqi refugee program for six full months after two Iraqi refugees were implicated in an al Qaeda plot in Bowling Green, KY. There’s been hundreds and hundreds of foreign nationals and   naturalized citizens who have been implicated in terrorism in the United States since  . This is a matter of national security. It’s a matter of keeping the public safe. And the reality is in a world with 7 billion people, the United States has an absolute sovereign right to determine who can and cannot enter into the United States. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0,213,17.75,12,0.38028169014084506,0,0,0,0,94.83963037484165,44.625289514866985,68.05298457411133,18.817789620606522,0.7699530516431925,0.004694835680751174,0.03755868544600939,0.009389671361502348,0.023474178403755867,0.014084507042253521,0.1596244131455399,0,0.004694835680751174,0.028169014084507043,0.10328638497652583,0,0.09859154929577464,0,0,0.018779342723004695,0.014084507042253521,0.06572769953051644,0.004694835680751174,0.023474178403755867,0.014084507042253521,0.03286384976525822,0,0,0.014084507042253521,0,0.08450704225352113,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04225352112676056,0.004694835680751174,0.004694835680751174,0.4131455399061033,0,0.004694835680751174,0,0,0.046948356807511735,0.018779342723004695,0,0.018779342723004695,0.023474178403755867,0.018779342723004695,0,0.004694835680751174,0.023474178403755867,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.018779342723004695,0,0.046948356807511735,0.24413145539906103,0.009389671361502348,0,0.014084507042253521,0.056338028169014086,0.06103286384976526,0.004694835680751174,0.009389671361502348,0.056338028169014086,0.12206572769953052,0.051643192488262914,0.004694835680751174,0,0.03755868544600939,0.16901408450704225,0.004694835680751174,0,0.014084507042253521,0,0.009389671361502348,0,0,0,0.07042253521126761,0.09859154929577464,0,0,0,0.04225352112676056,0.15492957746478872,0.13615023474178403,0,0.03286384976525822,0.004694835680751174,1,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,1.83,16,6,0,3,0,1,0,11.83,0,24,34.83,11.83,,0.060635704539036266,0,0.3405424265831667,0,0.11433841851550565,0,0,0,0.10564640559134646,0.5080666151703325,0.2791745113185196,0,0.16223290110168398,0,0.24399845080999227,0,0.05016325319085783,0,0.1017682228724081,0.14769113344358226,-0.5262827610914182,0.8523088665564178,12
200,"education , children , RBTH Daily Bella Devyatkina Source: Rossia One TV Channel Earlier this month Bella instantly became famous thanks to ""Amazing People,"" a show on the Russian television. The video with the girl answering questions, singing songs and talking about herself in different languages went viral. ""Compared with this child, I feel like an idiot,"" users wrote in the comments section. Video by YouTube Yulia Devyatkina, Bella's mother, said her daughter is not a child prodigy; they just invested a lot of time and effort in her development. ""Not every child needs to speak six languages, but any kid can master two or three,"" the mother said. Bella's parents understand that their daughter will not be using all these languages in every day life. ""When school starts we will focus on English, French and Chinese,"" the mother said. ""We also don't worry that Bella will not be interested in her classes. She has the same knowledge that any four-year-old child should have, but she is able to discuss these topics in different languages."" French baby talk Bella's mom is a linguist and has been teaching English to children for seven years. Her father works at the Radio Research and Development Institute based in Moscow. The family has an average income, but the parents decided that their daughter's development is their main priority. Italian polyglot: ‘To understand Russians you must speak Russian’ Initially, the parents wanted Bella to speak English like a native speaker, and the mother spoke with Bella in English and Russian from birth, alternating every other day. She made sure that the languages were not mixed, not allowing the girl to insert Russian words during a conversation in English. When Bella was 10-month-old, her parents added French. She could not talk but could point her finger at things when adults referred to them. Bella mastered reading even before she began to talk, and her parents taught this using special cards from the age of five months. For example, when ten-month-old Bella was shown the word ""hand"" written in Russian or English, she showed her little hand. By the age of one, she and her parents mastered 60 such cards. Bella began to read easily at the age of two. Chinese cartoons By the age of two Bella learned to speak in short sentences and read fluently in three languages. When she was just under three, her parents added Chinese to her program. According to the mother, Bella showed great interest in the new language, and she asked to watch cartoons in Chinese. At the age of three years and two months, little Bella showed an interest in learning Spanish and German, as well as dancing, violin and vocals. Then Arabic was also added. Bella walks, plays hide and seek, and reads ordinary books for children – she just does it in different languages. All her classes are held in the form of a game. The parents organize small educational excursions with native speakers for Bella, she also attends an English theater club, studies drawing in French, dancing in Spanish, and attends figure skating lessons with a native German speaker. In addition, the parents regularly organize joint language classes for Bella and her friends who are also brought up in a multilingual environment. Brain power Scientists confirm that the ability to speak in different languages, and switch from one to the other, depends on the interaction of different areas of the brain. They are activated depending on the language's phonetic characteristics, its grammatical system, imagery and even tonality. ""Every new experience is reflected in the brain by the emergence of new nerve connections,"" said psychologist Tatyana Dyachenko. ""The hippocampus, responsible for memory, stimulates the growth of new neurons. The volume of certain parts of the brain literally grows.'' ""Multilingualism has a positive effect on a child's overall development, though it may cause a lag in the development of speech at an early stage in comparison with children who grow up with only one language,"" said Kira Ivanova, an expert at the Institute of Linguistic Studies (ILS) in the Russian Academy of Sciences. Early training, however, does not guarantee that the child will be fluent in the language in the future. ""I know one mom who spoke with her child only in English until he was three,"" said Maria Molina, a researcher at the ILS. ""Now this boy struggles with the curriculum at an ordinary Russian school.""

201,"Carey Wedler | ANTIMEDIA Over the course of the 2016 presidential election, Americans who rail against Hillary Clinton have condemned the media’s bias in her favor — and rightfully so. Clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media — whose parent companies often donate to her — with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. But as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind Hillary Clinton – and hardly anyone is talking about it. Though outrage over Clinton’s corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like Goldman Sachs , Citibank, JP Morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate Hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks. When people think of Hollywood’s support for a political campaign, their minds tend to focus on the entertainment industry’s most visible figures — celebrities. From George Clooney , Katy Perry, and Leonardo DiCaprio to Justin Timberlake, Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Beyonce, and Jay-Z, the celebrity consensus this year has settled on Clinton. But underneath the stars’ ‘progressive’ choice is an intentional, systematic machine working in Hillary’s favor, and it mirrors other conglomerated industries that have aligned behind her. Moguls with Millions (and Billions) Back Hillary and the Clinton Family The first layer of Clinton’s corporate Hollywood allegiance is rather simple to peel back, simply because Hillary’s top industry donors make no secret of their support. Earlier this year, George Clooney held a $100,000-a-plate fundraiser for Clinton, one that earned $15 million dollars — far more than Goldman Sachs has collectively donated to her campaign. The actor’s event raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, which was recently revealed to be an avenue for maxed out donors to contribute more than the allowable amount. The Victory Fund has also been criticized for hoarding money for Hillary that was supposed to go to state Democratic parties. Clooney teamed up with one of corporate Hollywood’s most powerful executives, Jeffrey Katzenberg, for this fundraiser. Katzenberg rose to prominence at Walt Disney in the 1990s, where he helmed some of the millennial generation’s favorite childhood films: Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin , the Lion King , and the Little Mermaid were all products of Katzenberg’s leadership. Several years later, he partnered with Steven Spielberg (also a longtime Clinton supporter) and David Geffen, a music mogul, to create Dreamworks Animation. Katzenberg was the top bundler for Barack Obama in 2012 and also funded him in 2008, so it’s unsurprising the president takes his phone calls. Further, Katzenberg’s right-hand man, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times during Obama’s first term, Mother Jones reported at the time, enjoying a close relationship with the president — and some economic benefits. Katzenberg, who recently earned $391 million on the sale of Dreamworks to Comcast, has donated at least $1 million to Clinton’s campaign this election season. Then there’s billionaire Haim Saban, the staunchly pro-Israel entertainment mogul behind the original Power Rangers series. He is Clinton’s top individual donor, besting Katzenberg, with at least $6.4 million in donations to her campaign. He has contributed $15 million to the Clinton Foundation, and his wife, Cheryl, serves on the board. Saban has supported the Clintons since the 1990s, and during Bill’s time in office, he enjoyed the business perks of being friends with the president of the United States, as Mother Jones has detailed . His investments are tied to Wall Street, and he has also enjoyed Clinton’s condemnation of Boycott, Sanction, Divest, a nonviolent, market-based global protest movement challenging Israel’s occupation of Palestine. Both men, therefore, know well the perks of having friends in high places — and both are some of the top donors of any candidate in the 2016 race. But their very public— and lavish — support barely scratches the surface of the real machinations taking place between Hollywood’s corporate underbelly and its stake in American politics. The Studio Lobby Most people, if they’ve heard of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) at all, know it as the organization that rates films. It’s the familiar, almost comforting disclaimer that appears before a trailer or film, ranking it G, PG, PG-13, R, or in some cases, NC-17. Though the organization has its roots in the 20th century, founded as an effort to self-regulate their content, more than anything, it is corporate Hollywood’s lobby. The MPAA represents 20th Century Fox (owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.), Warner Brothers (owned by Time Warner), Disney, Universal (owned in part by Comcast), Sony Pictures, and Paramount Pictures (News Corp, Time Warner, and Comcast have all contributed to the Clinton Foundation). For some, it’s difficult to place corporate Hollywood in the same category as more reviled industries like banking, weapons manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals . This is likely, at least in part, because they deliver one of America’s favorite pastimes — entertainment. Yet the revolving door is strong, as is the MPAA’s political foundation. In fact, the MPAA’s longest running chairman was Jack Valenti , who served as an advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson before taking over the lobbying group. By 2011, former senator and presidential candidate, Chris Dodd, had taken the reins. Dodd, who makes $3 million a year working as the organization’s top lobbyist, takes his job seriously. As the Los Angeles Times reported , Dodd has increased lobbying funds and efforts in Congress. “ We’ve had a hundred meetings with new members of Congress since November ,” he told the publication last year. Dodd is a Clinton supporter. He officially endorsed her earlier this year. Disney chairman Bob Iger is also a huge Clinton supporter and member of the MPAA. Alongside Saban, Iger hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for her in August and held a meeting with Tim Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, in September. On that same trip, Kaine met with Warner Brothers executive Kevin Tsujihara, who donated to Hillary Clinton’s Victory Fund this year. He met with Fox Television executive Dana Walden, who also donated to Clinton. He also met with Kevin Reilly, an executive at Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, which owns Warner Brothers and CNN , an outlet condemned for heavily favoring Clinton this election cycle. Perhaps these private meetings were about gun control and equal rights. Or, perhaps, Kaine and the executives discussed business interests. Either way, the paper trail gets more decisive — and more revealing. What is the MPAA Hoping to Achieve? MPAA members Disney and Sony have independently advocated for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal , the globally loathed trade agreement criticized for granting carte blanche to corporations and stripping nations of their sovereignty. Disney has even prodded its employees to contribute lobbying funds in support of the agreement. Fox, Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, and other media companies have lobbied in favor of TPP . One of TPP’s most dangerous provisions is its intent to regulate copyright and intellectual property in favor of corporations – one of corporate Hollywood’s main objectives. Dodd is, unsurprisingly, a proponent of internet censorship legislation, which corporate Hollywood invariably backs in its attempts to preserve its copyright profits. Hollywood studios have been some of the biggest proponents of heavy internet regulation (with regard to copyright) and have waged campaigns against online piracy. The MPAA’s website claims “the most serious threat” to the film industry is online copyright theft. It makes sense, then, that the MPAA would be a member of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP . This massive trade group spent $658 billion dollars on lobbying in 2014, according to Common Cause, a left-leaning nonprofit lobbying organization. The coalition includes members like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Dow Chemical , Pfizer , GlaxoSmithKline , Boeing , and Viacom (another media behemoth). Interestingly, the coalition’s website no longer lists its members, though Anti-Media easily accessed an archived version of that information. These corporations, or their employees, have also donated funds to Hillary Clinton in one way or another, often via the Clinton Foundation, which has been documented to issue favors to entities that contribute funds. Dozens of media corporations have donated to the foundation. And — surprise, surprise — the only presidential candidate the MPAA has contributed to in 2016 is … Hillary Clinton. While it’s certainly the case that Hollywood executives lean liberal and many undoubtedly support Clinton due to a misguided moral imperative to stop Donald Trump, it would be naive to presume this is the only dynamic at play. This dynamic is evident in a letter from MPAA chief counsel Steven Fabrizio to Disney’s Alan Braverman, among others, assuring them of his efforts to pass the bill. “ Finally, in regard to trade ,” he wrote , “ the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP). ” Braverman donated to Clinton this year. Infiltrating the DNC Platform Drafting Committee Most damning is the fact that one MPAA lobbyist, former California congressman Howard Berman, ended up on the drafting committee for the Democratic platform this year (throughout the course of his political career, some of his top donors were Hollywood studios). According to an email released by Wikileaks, Berman met with now-disgraced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in May of this year — two months before he helped draft the platform. She appointed him to the platform drafting committee. That platform was widely criticized for refusing to condemn and reject TPP outright, as Bernie Sanders and his camp attempted to do. Berman helped vote down language against TPP. “But Hillary opposes TPP!” some might argue. Indeed, after claiming it was set to be the “gold standard” of trade agreements, she changed her mind and said she opposed it. But a leak from the recently released John Podesta batch showed there is a very strong chance she will change her mind, again, once elected. And considering Donald Trump’s anti-trade deal rhetoric against both NAFTA and TPP (not to mention his incendiary rhetoric), it makes little sense for corporate Hollywood to back Trump — even if they’re partly responsible for his meteoric rise via the Apprentice . In a vein similar to Berman’s, a former MPAA (and Disney, and Dow, and Citigroup) lobbyist, Jose Villareal, now serves as the Clinton campaign’s treasurer. Though there is no smoking gun proving corporate Hollywood is backing Clinton with the express intent of ensuring passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it’s telling that the MPAA’s homepage is a tribute to TPP (and, naturally, themselves). It’s telling that the organization donated to only one presidential candidate. It’s telling that executives within these corporations are supporting Clinton while the companies they represent heavily back TPP — and in many cases, Clinton. It’s telling that their parent corporations, like News Corp and Time Warner , are backing her — and the TPP. Considering six corporations control 90% of media in the United States and Clinton continually proves her loyalties to big business, it’s hardly surprising she’s the choice of corporate Hollywood. And it’s likely they’ll expect favors in return. As Dodd said following President Obama’s rejection of SOPA and PIPA following public outcry in 2012: “Candidly, those who count on quote ‘Hollywood’ for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who’s going to stand up for them when their job is at stake…Don’t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don’t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.”  ",1,1976,24.097560975609756,82,0.3901821862348178,0,0,0,0,91.8470936957779,6.149558414048751,70.60337847270696,52.340080971659916,0.7277327935222672,0.013663967611336033,0.044534412955465584,0.030870445344129555,0.043522267206477734,0.01720647773279352,0.19483805668016194,0.004554655870445344,0.0010121457489878543,0.0298582995951417,0.06882591093117409,0.0005060728744939271,0.05060728744939271,0.0025303643724696357,0.0010121457489878543,0.013663967611336033,0.006578947368421052,0.06831983805668017,0.0010121457489878543,0.07945344129554656,0.03340080971659919,0.053643724696356275,0.008097165991902834,0,0.016700404858299597,0.004554655870445344,0.08299595141700405,0.0005060728744939271,0.004554655870445344,0.0020242914979757085,0.011133603238866396,0,0.005060728744939271,0.028846153846153848,0.003036437246963563,0.003036437246963563,0.395748987854251,0.0005060728744939271,0.003036437246963563,0.00354251012145749,0.0015182186234817814,0.04554655870445344,0.003036437246963563,0.0010121457489878543,0.011639676113360324,0.010121457489878543,0.011639676113360324,0.015182186234817813,0.02479757085020243,0.009615384615384616,0.003036437246963563,0.014676113360323886,0.0015182186234817814,0.0005060728744939271,0.02479757085020243,0.18775303643724697,0.01568825910931174,0.00708502024291498,0.012145748987854251,0.044534412955465584,0.09919028340080972,0.03441295546558704,0.028846153846153848,0.04757085020242915,0.13512145748987855,0.07995951417004049,0.023785425101214574,0.0005060728744939271,0.008097165991902834,0.11386639676113361,0.0005060728744939271,0.0075910931174089065,0.00708502024291498,0.0010121457489878543,0.006072874493927126,0,0,0.021761133603238867,0.07236842105263158,0.06477732793522267,0.0005060728744939271,0.02277327935222672,0.0075910931174089065,0.04149797570850203,0.09058704453441295,0.09210526315789473,0.0010121457489878543,0.07236842105263158,0.0025303643724696357,37,0,82.24000000000001,1,24.965625,35.375,7,43,1.83,44.61875,14.25,61.05,98.2,0,37,25.09375,232.85062500000004,67.625,141.94375000000002,430.90062499999993,232.85062500000004,,0.4774383694370016,0,0.6700510684182854,0.02409817782955044,0.38137269935309165,0.46624631415711093,0.14737799763572107,0.514989096204658,0.043234903050881596,0.524213149317554,0.26028864640426097,0.6011999569289217,0.7080186396971004,0,0.3207713219735258,0.38258112778956477,0.10204240379661585,0.02963538344269484,0.062204176836140726,0.1888340886886781,0.7604564232469874,0.8111659113113219,125
202,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:35 UTC He roamed the streets of Sacramento for six years, raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark. To keep them from fighting back, he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks. Sometimes he threatened them with a gun. Police became frustrated, unable to identify him even though they had his DNA from the crimes. Desperate for a break, they checked a database of convicted felons, but came up empty-handed. Finally, they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database. They got lucky — the man had a brother in custody, which led authorities to the assailant. The ""Roaming Rapist"" is one of a handful of cases that California authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender DNA database for a father, son or brother of an elusive crime suspect. The state's early success using familial DNA searches to identify the so-called ""Grim Sleeper"" serial killer led Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck to predict that the method would ""change the way policing is done in the United States."" Civil liberty groups expressed alarm, saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns. Some questioned their legality. Since then, familial DNA has made more modest progress than Beck predicted but has also gained wider respect. Eight other states have followed California's lead, formally embracing the technique as a crime-fighting tool. And though many opponents still express concerns, California's approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state's strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes. Using the method helped detectives in the state identify two murderers, including the Grim Sleeper, and five men wanted for sexual assaults, according to the attorney general's office. Early last year, authorities arrested a San Diego County man accused of sneaking into children's bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them. A few months later, a Vacaville man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path. A Santa Cruz County judge in 2013 sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. Lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for DNA samples that match with a suspect's along several, but not all, markers. From there, California's testing method focuses on part of the Y-chromosome passed down along the male line, identifying father-son or full brother relationships. As more genetic markers for people's DNA are entered into offender databases, the technology will become more precise, said geneticist Frederick Bieber, a professor at Harvard University 's medical school and a leading authority on the technique. That could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who aren't in the system, he said. ""The technology is powerful...there's demonstrable success,"" Bieber said. Britain pioneered the use of familial DNA for crime solving more than a decade ago. In one of the earliest cases, detectives reopened the 1988 killing of a 20-year-old woman in Wales and compared DNA from the assailant to genetic profiles in Britain's database of known offenders. In 2002, they got a partial match to a 14-year-old boy. The teen wasn't alive at the time of the slaying, but detectives used the clue to focus on his uncle, who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder. Despite that conviction and others, the technology took some time to catch on in the U.S. and was used only sporadically. Among its earliest uses was the 2005 Kansas arrest of Dennis Rader, the BTK serial killer, which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter's Pap smear taken at a medical clinic. © Travis Heying / Los Angeles Times A familial DNA test led to the arrest of Dennis L. Rader, shown making a court appearance via video feed, in the BTK (""bind, torture and kill"") serial murder case in Kansas. By 2007, an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the Capitol in Sacramento. Gov. Jerry Brown — then the state's attorney general — began fielding letters and visits from prosecutors, urging him to consider using familial DNA. His advisers, however, were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds. In 2008, Brown enacted a comprehensive familial DNA policy — making California the first state in the country to do so. Under the policy, familial DNA is only to be used as a ""last resort"" when all other investigative angles have been exhausted. So far, the state Department of Justice has run 156 familial searches, many of them repeat queries, such as in the Grim Sleeper case. An initial search turned up nothing, but state officials ran another scan in 2010. A partial match came back to a man added to the database after a 2008 arrest for firearm and drug offenses. Detectives zeroed in on the man's father, Lonnie Franklin Jr., who lived close to where many of the victims' bodies were dumped in South L.A. Detectives believe Franklin killed at least 25 women over more than two decades . He was sentenced to death in August. Nabbing Franklin changed things for now-UCLA Law School Dean Jennifer Mnookin, who once condemned using DNA to find suspects by searching for relatives. Mnookin argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately represented in DNA databases. Although she still worries about the racial disparity, she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big cases, such as Franklin's, and how infrequently the technology is used. ""If it's helping us solve big cases,"" Mnookin said, ""it seems like a worthwhile trade-off."" Eight other states — Colorado, Wisconsin, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Wyoming, Utah and Florida — have protocols for the use of familial DNA, and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere. But the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy advocates, such as Steve Mercer, chief attorney for the forensic division of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. Mercer successfully lobbied for his state's formal ban on familial searches. Washington, D.C., is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright. Searching for relatives through partial matches is intrusive, he said, and raises concerns about the 4th Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure. ""It is a slippery slope,"" he said. Critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people. In 2014, the technology led police in an Idaho city to wrongfully suspect a New Orleans filmmaker of committing a notorious 1996 murder. Police homed in on him after examining an online database of genetic profiles. One profile, which was a near match to DNA left at the crime scene, belonged to a man who had donated his DNA years earlier to a hereditary studies project conducted by the Mormon church. An ancestry research company purchased the program's database, making it publicly available. Idaho Falls police obtained a court order compelling the company to turn over the identity of the man, who detectives thought could be related to the killer. Once they had his name, they scrubbed his family and focused on the man's son, Michael Usry. Detectives flew to New Orleans and interrogated him for more than three hours, before ordering him to provide a cheek swab. Usry asked whether someone he knew had committed a heinous crime. No, the detectives told him, they were looking at him. He waited anxiously for a month, wondering whether he'd be wrongfully arrested. Finally, an email came. ""Mr. Usry,"" it read, ""your DNA did not match with our case. Sorry for the inconvenience."" The science is complicated and his experience shows it isn't the ""perfect system"" some supporters make it out to be, said Usry, now 37 and living in Colorado. ""I'm still just scratching my head,"" he said. ""Civil rights are being taken from us at an alarming rate."" Still, supporters of familial DNA searches point to its successes. Sacramento's ""Roaming Rapist,"" Dereck Sanders, spent 14 years on the loose, attacking women in the late-1990s and early-2000s. He sexually assaulted 10 victims, including two teenagers,14 and 15, who sneaked out one night to meet up with friends. Officials ran his DNA and began trailing Sanders, whose brother — a convicted rapist — was in the offender DNA database. Sacramento sheriff's deputies followed him to a McDonald's drive-thru, where he ordered a Happy Meal, and then to a park where he ate and threw away his trash. Detectives retrieved the garbage and took it back to the county's crime lab. There, officials tested the DNA from a straw Sanders had used. It was a match. ""That was one of the happiest meals we ever had,"" said Rob Gold, the supervising deputy district attorney who prosecuted Sanders. ""It would not have been solved without familial DNA."" Sanders' 14-year-old victim, who is now 33, said the rape destroyed her for years. She obsessed over maintaining control in all situations and felt paranoid. She watched until her girlfriends walked into their homes and shut the door behind them, but still found herself texting them to double-check that they were safe. ( The Times generally does not identify victims of sex crimes.) She got counseling and tried to understand the different ways the rape had affected her. Still, the same two questions often came to mind. Is he hurting anyone else, she wondered? Will I ever get the chance to look him in the eye? The answer came in the fall of 2014 at Sanders' trial, where she testified against him. He was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault and sentenced to life in prison. To her, the question of whether to use the technology is almost silly. ""It's out there, it's available,"" she said. ""Do it."" Authorities in California have used familial DNA searches to solve several murder and sexual assault cases: Lonnie Franklin Jr. The ""Grim Sleeper"" serial killer prowled the streets of South L.A. for more than two decades. After getting a partial DNA hit to his son in 2010, authorities charged Franklin with killing nine women and a teenage girl. He was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death. Elvis Garcia A man sexually assaulted a barista in a Santa Cruz coffee shop in 2008, threatening her with a knife and barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. In 2011, a partial hit to the assailant's father led police to Garcia, who was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 65 years to life in prison. James Brown The 1978 slaying of a 26-year-old woman in an Orange County parking lot remained unsolved for three decades until familial DNA helped lead authorities to Brown, who died in 1996 and had been cremated. Forensic scientists used a DNA sample from his son to confirm Brown was the killer. Dereck Sanders Beginning in the late 1990s, the ""Roaming Rapist"" sexually assaulted women and girls across Sacramento County. Sheriff's deputies arrested Sanders in 2012 after a crime lab got a partial hit to his brother, a convicted rapist. Sanders is serving life in prison. Michael Simpson In 2002, a man raped and beat a 55-year-old woman behind a store in Sunnyvale. Using a familial DNA search, police identified Simpson as a suspect. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Gilbert Chavarria During a heat wave in the summer of 2013, when many people left their windows cracked open, a San Diego County man snuck into the bedrooms of six children and cut holes in their pajamas before molesting them. Authorities said a familial DNA hit ultimately led them to arrest Chavarria. He has pleaded not guilty. Jeremy Delaunay In the summer of 2014, a teenager in Vacaville sexually assaulted a woman along a bike path before stealing her jewelry. A year later, authorities arrested Delaunay.

203,"Laughter saved Linda Ragoo’s face. That is what a doctor told her after she had a stroke in 2003. It happened on a Sunday, at the end of an exhausting weekend of chores, errands and obligations. Ms. Ragoo felt part of her body go numb. “I sat down by the bed and I felt my leg, like it was sleeping,” Ms. Ragoo recalled. “It’s sleeping too long. ” She was able to call one of her sisters, who rushed to Ms. Ragoo’s Brooklyn apartment and found her on the floor, unable to move, the left side of her body paralyzed. While they waited for an ambulance, Ms. Ragoo asked to use the bathroom. Her sister fetched a long stick, presumably to prod her across the floor. Ms. Ragoo cracked up at the absurdity of the moment. “My sister said, ‘Stop this nonsense, stop this nonsense,’” she said. “And I keep laughing. ” She spent the next month in a hospital. Ms. Ragoo’s mobility is still restricted by partial paralysis. But her facial muscles, built up by years of laughter, are as they have always been. Ms. Ragoo, 78, credits her jocular spirit and easygoing sense of humor in part to her upbringing in Trinidad, with its tropical weather,   way of life, and holiday and carnival celebrations. In the 1970s, Ms. Ragoo went to New York in search of an even better life. She settled in Brooklyn and found work as a nurse’s aide. Though hardships and tragedy have marked her life, “I can make a joke out of nothing,” she said. Just recently, she dozed off in her recliner and somehow managed to slide off it, flopping to the floor. For her, it was a rude, yet hilarious, awakening. “I laugh at my own self when I do stupid things,” she said. “I laugh at myself many times. ” Levity not only carried Ms. Ragoo through the setbacks after her stroke, but it also helped her cope with a more painful loss. Her son Satinus, 58, had a heart attack and died in 2014. He was a nurse’s aide, like his mother. “I’m telling you, things can’t put you down,” Ms. Ragoo said of staying positive through trying times. She lives alone in a   apartment in Crown Heights, which is how she likes it. There is plenty of space just for her. And she does not need much of it to flourish. When it was time to get a new mattress, she willingly downgraded from a queen to a full. As much as she relishes independence, health problems drove her to seek outside help. Ms. Ragoo has arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and osteoporosis, as well as mobility issues caused by the stroke. Ms. Ragoo sought help from Heights and Hills, which offers support services for older adults, and has a home attendant. Each month, Ms. Ragoo receives $811 from Social Security and $612 from a pension. Because of her tight income, Ms. Ragoo could not afford an   last summer. Usually a fan had been sufficient to keep her cool, but not last year. “When that heat took me, I couldn’t stand it,” she said. She mentioned her concerns to her social worker and made clear the severity of the problem. “I told her, ‘This is not funny. ’” Ms. Ragoo said. Her caseworker reached out to FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and applied for a $600 grant in Neediest funds, which allowed Ms. Ragoo to buy an  . Ms. Ragoo fondly recalls more youthful pleasures, like traveling, especially cruises, and taking trips to the casino. Ms. Ragoo has not done either in some time. But it is hard to keep her from a dance floor pulsating with salsa or calypso. Her coordination and energy are not what they once were, but she still has rhythm. “I dance with my cane,” she said. “I hold my cane and I move from side to side. Because they say if you don’t use it, you lose it. ” But she is quick to joke with people about her age. On a recent December afternoon, Ms. Ragoo declared she was just 16, despite the cane clutched to her side and dark glasses shielding her eyes after cataract surgery. “It’s the best therapy, to laugh,” she said. “You have to keep on laughing. ”",0,741,13.981132075471699,53,0.23481781376518218,0,0,0,0,80.23842190947454,12.28941401121852,82.414720232534,61.60266791238451,0.865047233468286,0.014844804318488529,0.048582995951417005,0.02834008097165992,0.05128205128205128,0.01349527665317139,0.242914979757085,0.004048582995951417,0.001349527665317139,0.017543859649122806,0.06342780026990553,0.001349527665317139,0.05263157894736842,0.043184885290148446,0.014844804318488529,0.01349527665317139,0.006747638326585695,0.07017543859649122,0,0.08367071524966262,0.02834008097165992,0.06072874493927125,0,0.001349527665317139,0.02564102564102564,0.008097165991902834,0.08097165991902834,0,0.006747638326585695,0.012145748987854251,0.09851551956815115,0,0,0.06072874493927125,0,0,0.4898785425101215,0.02834008097165992,0.022941970310391364,0.009446693657219974,0.02699055330634278,0.037786774628879895,0.002699055330634278,0.001349527665317139,0.012145748987854251,0.01349527665317139,0.014844804318488529,0.004048582995951417,0.010796221322537112,0.024291497975708502,0.014844804318488529,0.016194331983805668,0,0.001349527665317139,0.017543859649122806,0.21862348178137653,0.004048582995951417,0,0.043184885290148446,0.09716599190283401,0.048582995951417005,0.10796221322537113,0.03508771929824561,0.048582995951417005,0.1484480431848853,0.145748987854251,0.014844804318488529,0,0.04048582995951417,0.1524966261808367,0.002699055330634278,0.008097165991902834,0.009446693657219974,0.005398110661268556,0.006747638326585695,0,0,0.06882591093117409,0.15384615384615385,0.06612685560053981,0,0.008097165991902834,0.005398110661268556,0.06477732793522267,0.11875843454790823,0.12685560053981107,0,0.017543859649122806,0.006747638326585695,7,81.25,40,3,7,1,0,18,13,31,21,33.875,15.5,16.25,7,0,166.625,5,116.25,282.875,166.625,,0.17695696176597023,0.713923943496766,0.5512858376148583,0.08437005097678234,0.17695696176597023,0.029799472325023054,0,0.35602926828748566,0.28535278956070975,0.4877462319008262,0.3921009128209817,0.509914996484855,0.3225293546557986,0.33293967098326244,0.5180761107455791,0,0.17486553850190215,0.005247277974550702,0.12199921290830382,0.29686475141020596,0.6863384891670791,0.703135248589794,71
204,"Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI director James Comey was “an epic troll” on the Democrat Party.  Partial transcript as follows: LIMBAUGH: Hi, friends. This is great. I have been laughing all morning long. I have been laughing starting with last night. Can we agree that Donald Trump is probably enjoying this more than anybody wants to admit or that anybody knows? So he fires Comey yesterday. Who’s he meet with today? He’s meeting with the Soviet, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov! I mean, what an epic troll this is. The Democrat Party is going bananas  —   completely, totally unhinged  —   on the road to literal insanity. Do you realize  …    ? Let me tell you what’s happened here. The Democrat Party has once again thrown Hillary Clinton overboard. Hillary Clinton is the most   woman in America by people in her own party, and it’s happened again. If you’re wondering what I’m talking about, stand by I’m gonna explain all of this. But they have just chosen sides and, once again, Hillary gets thrown under the bus. And not only that, the Democrats are rolling that bus backwards and forwards. She’s finished! She’s over with. The Democrat Party and the media have made it clear that she is fodder. She is irrelevant here. It is amazing. Two days ago, they were all talking about how Comey needs to be fired because of how he was mistreating Hillary, and the Hillary people were running around claiming that Comey’s a bad guy. And now Comey gets fired, and all of a sudden they do a 180! You know, my friends, I’ve often spoke of the connection Donald Trump has with his audience, with his supporters. I understand it because  …     Well, I just understand it.

205,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency. The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past. Twitter disclosed in a federal court filing on Thursday that it had received a summons directing it to reveal the identity or identities of those behind @ALT_USCIS, one of several     run by people purporting to be current or former federal employees. The @ALT_USCIS account, which quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, has frequently criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies and enforcement actions. Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government’s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have “a grave chilling effect” on the speech of   that voice resistance to government policies. “A   tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,” Twitter said in its filing. “These First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life. ” Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment. Even before this episode, previous presidential administrations have sought access the valuable digital information held by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies, in what some of the companies have said is an overreach of government power. Federal officials have typically said in such cases that they need the data at issue for national security or other reasons. Last year, for example, Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, squared off against the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a contentious case involving issues of privacy and national security. The F. B. I. asked Apple to unlock an iPhone that had been used by a gunman in a 2015 attack in San Bernardino, Calif. in which 14 people were fatally shot. Apple refused, citing its customers’ privacy concerns and the potential legal precedent. The F. B. I. dropped the matter after finding another way to open the iPhone without Apple’s help. The new case involving Twitter is more straightforward than Apple’s standoff with the F. B. I. which required the creation of new technology to circumvent the iPhone’s encryption. The Twitter case is centered instead on the protection of free speech, which is critical to the social media company’s platform. Twitter has a history of protecting its users’ First Amendment rights. In 2012, it filed an appeal in a New York State court to protect account information believed to have been used by an Occupy Wall Street protester. The company has also sued the federal government over rules related to whether it would be allowed to simply disclose requests for user data from federal agencies. Mr. Trump himself is a   Twitter user, regularly sending out incendiary missives about the economy, politics and all manner of other topics from his @realDonaldTrump account. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to represent the anonymous user or users behind @ALT_USCIS. “To unmask an anonymous speaker online, the government must have a strong justification,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, an A. C. L. U. attorney involved in the case. “But in this case the government has given no reason at all, leading to concerns that it is simply trying to stifle dissent. ” The case stems from a wave of alternative government agency accounts that sprouted on Twitter after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Upon being sworn into office, the president began to silence federal agencies from speaking out on the social media platform after the National Park Service’s official Twitter account posted    images comparing the size of the crowds at Mr. Trump’s inauguration “to the apparently larger crowd size at President Obama’s 2009 inauguration,” according to Twitter’s court filing. In response, alternative accounts began to pop up, with many professing to be written by current or former employees of federal agencies. Accounts with handles like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff had attracted tens of thousands of followers less than a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Many of the accounts have since posted messages in opposition to the Trump administration’s views. The @Alt_CDC account, for instance, once called the prospect of a “vaccine review committee”  —   an idea that Mr. Trump had discussed with others  —   a “serious threat to global public health. ” The @ALT_USCIS account, which was created in January, has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, among other topics. Messages posted by the account have referred to Mr. Trump’s executive order restricting travel to the United States by people from several mostly Muslim countries as the “#MuslimBan. ” The account has also described itself as “official inside resistance” and has said several times that the person or people using it to post messages is a current federal employee of Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Twitter said in its court filing that about 19, 000 employees and contractors work for Citizenship and Immigration Services. In March, Customs and Border Protection sent Twitter a summons that ordered the company to hand over information about the @ALT_USCIS account, including the names, phone numbers, mailing addresses and internet protocol addresses of the account holder or holders. The summons cited 19 U. S. Code 1509, a federal law that authorizes Customs and Border Protection to “obtain documents only for investigations and inquiries relating to the importation of merchandise. ” Twitter said the law was not relevant to the agency’s request and also that the summons violated the Stored Communications Act, which protects individuals’ privacy and proprietary interests. As for @ALT_USCIS, the account was particularly active on Thursday, posting more than a dozen messages after Twitter’s suit against the government became public. The account, which added 32, 000 followers within two months of being started, had ballooned to more than 77, 000 followers by early in the evening. Highlighted at the top of the account: a message featuring a screenshot of the Constitution and the First Amendment.",0,1069,19.089285714285715,56,0.4087932647333957,0,0,0.0009354536950420954,0,98.72600492488857,22.012321531498333,72.8348300592454,33.85226513430442,0.775491113189897,0.01403180542563143,0.040224508886810104,0.018709073900841908,0.027128157156220765,0.02806361085126286,0.17212347988774557,0.00841908325537886,0.0009354536950420954,0.019644527595884004,0.10757717492984098,0,0.047708138447146865,0.0037418147801683817,0.0009354536950420954,0.014967259120673527,0.0037418147801683817,0.07296538821328344,0.0009354536950420954,0.05144995322731525,0.023386342376052385,0.03835360149672591,0,0.0018709073900841909,0.025257249766136577,0.004677268475210477,0.11599625818521983,0,0,0.0018709073900841909,0,0,0.002806361085126286,0.04490177736202058,0.0037418147801683817,0.0037418147801683817,0.4237605238540692,0.002806361085126286,0.01777362020579981,0,0.002806361085126286,0.047708138447146865,0.0205799812909261,0,0.019644527595884004,0.011225444340505144,0.018709073900841908,0.007483629560336763,0.023386342376052385,0.01028999064546305,0.0037418147801683817,0.011225444340505144,0.0205799812909261,0,0.019644527595884004,0.16931711880261927,0.021515434985968196,0,0.023386342376052385,0.057998129092609915,0.1028999064546305,0.00841908325537886,0.015902712815715623,0.06454630495790459,0.1627689429373246,0.05612722170252572,0.014967259120673527,0,0.0205799812909261,0.1225444340505145,0.0018709073900841909,0.0037418147801683817,0.011225444340505144,0.0009354536950420954,0.0037418147801683817,0,0,0.0018709073900841909,0.09073900841908325,0.06828811973807297,0,0.01777362020579981,0.0018709073900841909,0.04396632366697849,0.08699719363891488,0.08699719363891488,0,0.0608044901777362,0.0018709073900841909,19.375,0,59.8,1,1,12,7,21,1,33,25,3,22.375,0,19.375,0,58.375,19,93,168.375,58.375,,0.3666632528819672,0,0.6411740918431668,0.029013763236249348,0.029013763236249348,0.26393116059052896,0.1729830134729609,0.38555879571225843,0.029013763236249348,0.4964914524187007,0.4275960132001526,0.08226750961664182,0.40068837054092804,0,0.10676232268609791,0,0.04924601919223874,0.016028682906253297,0.07845618475166087,0.1420436570705473,-0.5940196337060091,0.8579563429294527,52
206,"OAKLAND, Calif.  —   Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, is fairly open about the fact that he plays favorites. When it comes to shooting the basketball, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are allowed to do whatever they want. They can chuck shots from the bleachers. Bad shots do not exist for them. “That’s the rule,” Kerr said, adding, “I trust their judgment. ” Draymond Green has not earned the right to be included in their elite little group  —   not yet, anyway. But he was at his dynamic best in the Warriors’   victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night in Game 2 of the N. B. A. finals. He buried  . He defended. He rebounded. And he helped carry the Warriors to a     series lead at Oracle Arena. “I don’t come into the game saying, ‘Oh, I have to shoot a lot more,’ ” said Green, who finished with 28 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. “Like, that’s not me. That’s not what I do for this team. But at the end of the day, if the game says shoot, you’re supposed to shoot. Because usually when you don’t, it turns into a disaster. ” The Cavaliers are in a world of trouble ahead of Game 3, which is scheduled for Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. The Warriors can sniff a second straight championship, can sense the final act in their   season. After setting an N. B. A. record by winning 73 games in the regular season, they need two more for another title. “Everything changes when we go to Cleveland,” Kerr said. “We know that. We have unbelievable respect for this team, and we’ve got to go on the road and try to do it again. ” Curry scored 18 points, and Thompson added 17  —   two more relatively muted efforts for them as defenders collapsed on them. But they found Green with so much open space on the perimeter, he could have been lounging on a beach towel and sipping a cool drink. “Tonight,” Thompson said, “he was one of us. ” Green relished his opportunities. He shot 11 of 20 from the field and 5 of 8 from   range. Kerr was miffed about only one of Green’s attempts, when he pulled up in transition and did a little dance before he let the ball fly. It was not what Kerr considered a   shot. Green made it anyway. “He becomes our safety valve when there’s pressure,” Kerr said. “He becomes an open shooter when they’re stepping out on Steph or Klay. So it’s a good situation for him. ” LeBron James collected 19 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds, but he said he was disappointed with his performance, citing his 7 turnovers. The Cavaliers committed 18 as a team, which led to 26 points for the Warriors. “It’s hard for me to kind of pinpoint what’s not working and what could work right now,” James said. “Obviously, not much work is working, especially offensively. ” But James did not benefit from much help. Kyrie Irving had 10 points, and Kevin Love scored 5 points before he departed for the locker room early in the second half with dizziness. He was placed in the league’s concussion protocol. The Cavaliers shot 35. 4 percent over all. It looked as if they were hoisting shots in a stiff wind. “They were tougher than us and more aggressive,” Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said. While the Warriors are celebrated for their   shooting, they also broke out their lunch pails and hard hats. When Love caught an inadvertent elbow to the back of the head midway through the second quarter, Green went straight at the rim for a layup. He punctuated the play by flexing his biceps as Love writhed in pain nearby. The victory was not without its challenges for Golden State. Curry picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter and took a seat on the bench. But when the Cavaliers threatened, Green answered with another   his fourth of the game. Curry returned at the start of the fourth quarter. He promptly swished a   from another ZIP code. The lead was 23. Curry and Thompson had both struggled Thursday in Game 1, when they combined to score just 20 points on    shooting. Propped up by their bench, the Warriors won by 15  —   a result that portended danger for the Cavaliers. If they could not capitalize when Curry and Thompson were not playing good basketball, what did they expect to do once those two players started making shots? And rest assured, they would start making shots. Their problems would not persist forever. Ahead of Game 2, the Cavaliers said they wanted to operate with more pace, a familiar refrain for them this season. But playing fast is a dicey proposition against Golden State, which employs players with advanced degrees in transition basketball. The Warriors actually stumbled through a sluggish start, a Lamborghini stuck in second gear. After James went baseline for a spinning layup that put Cleveland ahead by 4 early in the second quarter, Kerr had seen enough. He called a   timeout so he could share some words of wisdom with his players. They promptly hit the gas. Green sank a  . Curry buried a   jumper. And the Warriors continued to apply pressure, building a   lead late in the second quarter.

207,"WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department’s inspector general said Thursday that he would open a broad investigation into how the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, handled the case over Hillary Clinton’s emails, including his decision to discuss it at a news conference and to disclose 11 days before the election that he had new information that could lead him to reopen it. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, will not look into the decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton or her aides. But he will review actions Mr. Comey took that Mrs. Clinton and many of her supporters believe cost her the election. They are: the news conference in July at which he announced he was not indicting Mrs. Clinton but described her behavior as “extremely careless” the letter to Congress in late October in which he said that newly discovered emails could potentially change the outcome of the F. B. I. ’s investigation and the letter three days before the election in which he said that he was closing it again. The inspector general’s office said that it was initiating the investigation in response to complaints from members of Congress and the public about actions by the F. B. I. and the Justice Department during the campaign that could be seen as politically motivated. For Mr. Comey and the agency he heads, the Clinton investigation was politically fraught from the moment the F. B. I. received a referral in July 2015 to determine whether Mrs. Clinton and her aides had mishandled classified information. Senior F. B. I. officials believed there was never going to be a good outcome, since it put them in the middle of a bitterly partisan issue. Whatever the decision on whether to charge Mrs. Clinton with a crime, Mr. Comey, a Republican former Justice Department official appointed by President Obama, was going to get hammered. And he was. Republicans, who made her use of a private email server a centerpiece of their campaign against Mrs. Clinton, attacked Mr. Comey after he decided there was not sufficient evidence she had mishandled classified information to prosecute her. The Clinton campaign believed the F. B. I. investigation was overblown and seriously damaged her chances to win the White House and resented Mr. Comey’s comments about Mrs. Clinton at his news conference. But the campaign was particularly upset about Mr. Comey’s two letters, which created a wave of damaging news stories at the end of the campaign, when Mrs. Clinton and her supporters thought they had put the email issue behind them. In the end, the emails that the F. B. I. reviewed  —   which came up during an unrelated inquiry into Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide, Huma Abedin  —   proved irrelevant to the investigation’s outcome. The Clinton campaign said Mr. Comey’s actions quite likely caused a significant number of undecided voters to cast ballots for   Donald J. Trump. F. B. I. officials said Thursday that they welcomed the scrutiny. In a statement, Mr. Comey described Mr. Horowitz as “professional and independent” and promised to cooperate with his investigation. “I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency,” Mr. Comey said. Brian Fallon, the former press secretary for the Clinton campaign and the former top spokesman for the Justice Department, said the inspector general’s investigation was long overdue. “This is highly encouraging and to be expected, given Director Comey’s drastic deviation from Justice Department protocol,” he said. “A probe of this sort, however long it takes to conduct, is utterly necessary in order to take the first step to restore the F. B. I. ’s reputation as a nonpartisan institution. ” Mr. Horowitz has the authority to recommend a criminal investigation if he finds evidence of illegality, but there has been no suggestion that Mr. Comey’s actions were unlawful. Rather, the question has been whether he acted inappropriately, showed bad judgment or violated Justice Department guidelines. It is not clear what the consequences would be for Mr. Comey if he was found to have done any of those things. The Justice Department and the F. B. I. have a longstanding policy against discussing criminal investigations. Another Justice Department policy declares that politics should play no role in investigative decisions. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have interpreted that policy broadly to prohibit taking any steps that might even hint at an impression of partisanship. Inspectors general have investigated F. B. I. directors before, but rarely. The most   example was the investigation of William S. Sessions, who was fired by President Bill Clinton after an internal inquiry cited him for financial misconduct. In recent years, the inspector general has investigated accusations of wrongdoing by the F. B. I. involving some of its most sensitive operations, including a number of surveillance and counterterrorism programs. As part of the review, the inspector general will examine other issues related to the email investigation that Republicans have raised. They include whether the deputy director of the F. B. I. Andrew G. McCabe, should have recused himself from any involvement in it. In 2015, Mr. McCabe’s wife ran for a State Senate seat in Virginia as a Democrat and accepted nearly $500, 000 in political contributions from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a key ally of the Clintons. Though Mr. McCabe did not assume his post until February 2016, months after his wife was defeated, critics both within the agency and outside of it felt that he should have recused himself. The F. B. I. has said Mr. McCabe played no role in his wife’s campaign. He also told his superiors she was running and sought ethics advice from F. B. I. officials. Mr. Horowitz said he would also investigate whether the Justice Department’s top congressional liaison, Peter Kadzik, had improperly provided information to the Clinton campaign. A hacked email posted by WikiLeaks showed that Mr. Kadzik alerted the campaign about a coming congressional hearing that was likely to raise questions about Mrs. Clinton. Investigators will be helped in gathering evidence by a law that Congress passed just last month, which ensures that inspectors general across the government will have access to all relevant agency records in their reviews. The law grew out of skirmishes between the F. B. I. and the Justice Department inspector general over attempts by the F. B. I. to keep grand jury material and other records off limits. The new law means Mr. Horowitz’s investigators should have access to any records deemed relevant. Mr. Trump has not indicated whether he intends to keep Mr. Comey in his job. When he cleared Mrs. Clinton of criminal wrongdoing during the campaign, Mr. Trump accused him of being part of a rigged system. Although the president does not need cause to fire the F. B. I. director, a critical inspector general report could provide justification to do so if Mr. Trump is looking for some.",0,1172,11.26923076923077,104,0.36860068259385664,0,0,0,0,89.577084349098,7.334951689660146,76.06639776605647,27.188737201365186,0.8156996587030717,0.011945392491467578,0.040955631399317405,0.02303754266211604,0.028156996587030716,0.010238907849829351,0.18088737201365188,0.004266211604095563,0.0008532423208191126,0.013651877133105802,0.08959044368600683,0,0.06313993174061433,0.002559726962457338,0.0008532423208191126,0.017064846416382253,0.007679180887372013,0.11006825938566553,0.0008532423208191126,0.03754266211604096,0.01877133105802048,0.04948805460750853,0,0,0.027303754266211604,0.015358361774744027,0.11860068259385666,0,0.0034129692832764505,0.002559726962457338,0.020477815699658702,0,0.011092150170648464,0.05546075085324232,0.0008532423208191126,0.0008532423208191126,0.447098976109215,0.0008532423208191126,0.011092150170648464,0.0008532423208191126,0.016211604095563138,0.040955631399317405,0.016211604095563138,0,0.03498293515358362,0.016211604095563138,0.002559726962457338,0.050341296928327645,0.017918088737201365,0.01877133105802048,0.010238907849829351,0.013651877133105802,0.016211604095563138,0,0.007679180887372013,0.189419795221843,0.0034129692832764505,0,0.021331058020477817,0.11689419795221843,0.07167235494880546,0.06228668941979522,0.014505119453924915,0.09300341296928327,0.12627986348122866,0.10324232081911262,0.013651877133105802,0,0.008532423208191127,0.09897610921501707,0,0.008532423208191127,0.0017064846416382253,0,0.006825938566552901,0,0.0008532423208191126,0.03924914675767918,0.12457337883959044,0.042662116040955635,0,0.021331058020477817,0.006825938566552901,0.03668941979522184,0.10324232081911262,0.11262798634812286,0,0.06655290102389079,0,14,0,106,3,6,4,16.75,32.6,6,59.35,25,11,16.55,0,14,1,69.55,29.775,147.35,241.67499999999998,69.55,,0.23487167625027458,0,0.6991760809938461,0.06171948382998386,0.11626325930713949,0.08063375388365411,0.2686145169345545,0.41684239149981905,0.11626325930713949,0.565469576919832,0.3540724571128096,0.19432219859296618,0.2662611688547431,0,0.32665497025881635,0.02145599663490405,0.05195435785384802,0.022242142416942126,0.11007152594916615,0.18053298970997442,-0.7069576106018727,0.8194670102900256,75
208,"Trump and Clinton Choice Impacting Global Markets November 08, 2016 Trump and Clinton Choice Impacting Global Markets Stocks and the dollar were little changed on Tuesday as global investors trod carefully, readying for the outcome of one of the most contentious U.S. presidential elections in history. Trade was largely driven by cautious expectations of a win for Democrat Hillary Clinton, but some sharp swings in recent days across all asset classes meant big bets were relatively thin on the ground as Americans started voting. Wall Street's S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq markets were expected to open a touch lower having enjoyed their best day since March on Monday, while the dollar held steady as bonds and gold made ground. ""While the market is broadly pricing in a Clinton victory, we are well away from the final results,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group. ""It is certainly too early to speculate. The least we can say is that the risk appetite is quite firm for such a high event-risk day."" Europe's index of leading 300 shares, which posted its biggest gain in two months on Monday, was flat ahead of U.S. trading.

209,"Chinese J-20 stealth fighter debuts in skies of Zhuhai November 01, 2016 China unveils its J-20 stealth fighter on an air show in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, November 1, 2016. China Daily/via REUTERS China publicly debuted the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter on Tuesday, a 21st century comparable to the US F-22 and F-35 fighter jet. J-20 was shown at Airshow China in southern city of Zhuhai. J-20’s swept over dignitaries, hundreds of spectators and industry executives gathered at the show's opening ceremony. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pushed to toughen the armed forces amid South China Sea row. Bradley Perrett of Aviation Week: ""It is clearly a big step forward in Chinese combat capability.” State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) estimates Chinese market will need 6,865 new aircraft worth $930 billion over the next 20 years. Boeing Co and Airbus Group matched the COMAC forecast: China would make up almost 1/5 of global demand, 40,000 planes over the next two decades. Analysts: Brief and relatively cautious J-20 routine answered few questions, pilots did not open weapon bay doors, or perform low-speed passes. Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute: ""It's a change of tactics for the Chinese to publicly show off weapons that aren't in full squadron service yet and demonstrates a lot of confidence in the capability, and also a lot of pride."" Also displayed: Latest Chinese weapon systems, radar and drones, included the Xian Y-20 strategic airlifter, and what organizers say is the largest amphibious plane now in production - the AG600. 150-seater COMAC C919 passenger jet was absent from the airshow schedule. COMAC: China Eastern Airlines will be the launch customer for the C919, which may take first test flight late 2016 or early 2017. COMAC secured 23 new orders for C919 at Airshow, taking total orders to 570. (ZHUHAI, CHINA) China showed its Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter in public for the first time on Tuesday, opening the country's biggest meeting of aircraft makers and buyers with a show of its military clout. Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai, offers Beijing an opportunity to demonstrate its ambitions in civil aerospace and to underline its growing capability in defense. China is set to overtake the U.S. as the world's top aviation market in the next decade. Two J-20 jets, Zhuhai's headline act, swept over dignitaries, hundreds of spectators and industry executives gathered at the show's opening ceremony in a flypast that barely exceeded a minute, generating a deafening roar that was met with gasps and applause and set off car alarms in a parking lot. Experts say China has been refining designs for the J-20, first glimpsed by planespotters in 2010, in the hope of narrowing a military technology gap with the United States. President Xi Jinping has pushed to toughen the armed forces as China takes a more assertive stance in Asia, particularly in the South China and East China seas.",1,516,24.571428571428573,21,0.3624031007751938,0,0,0,0,98.4438350921764,43.114935400516806,63.64758497316637,5.288975021533163,0.7228682170542635,0.025193798449612403,0.03875968992248062,0.01744186046511628,0.03875968992248062,0.011627906976744186,0.17829457364341086,0.015503875968992248,0.001937984496124031,0.015503875968992248,0.08333333333333333,0,0.03488372093023256,0.011627906976744186,0,0.01744186046511628,0.007751937984496124,0.0562015503875969,0.011627906976744186,0.05813953488372093,0.015503875968992248,0.03875968992248062,0.03294573643410853,0,0.007751937984496124,0.005813953488372093,0.10852713178294573,0,0,0,0,0,0.007751937984496124,0.015503875968992248,0.013565891472868217,0.013565891472868217,0.32751937984496127,0.011627906976744186,0.005813953488372093,0.001937984496124031,0,0.023255813953488372,0.001937984496124031,0,0.005813953488372093,0.003875968992248062,0,0.001937984496124031,0.009689922480620155,0.02131782945736434,0.003875968992248062,0.029069767441860465,0.001937984496124031,0,0.07945736434108527,0.19767441860465115,0.005813953488372093,0.003875968992248062,0.01937984496124031,0.04263565891472868,0.050387596899224806,0.003875968992248062,0.009689922480620155,0.0562015503875969,0.13372093023255813,0.027131782945736434,0.013565891472868217,0,0.007751937984496124,0.19186046511627908,0,0.01744186046511628,0.007751937984496124,0.001937984496124031,0.013565891472868217,0,0,0,0.04263565891472868,0.1182170542635659,0,0.01937984496124031,0,0.05813953488372093,0.05813953488372093,0.06589147286821706,0.001937984496124031,0.044573643410852716,0.001937984496124031,35.75,0,24.375,3.2,0,0,5,1,5,15.675,5,0,1,0,35.75,6,46.75,11,34.25,88,46.75,,0.6356244681872111,0,0.5432493145092915,0.1350558495268973,0,0,0.19612533584707845,0.04652482465851837,0.19612533584707845,0.4333833579702926,0.19612533584707845,0,0.04652482465851837,0,0.0889129881342269,0.22646721143623746,0.08173076923076923,0.019230769230769232,0.059877622377622376,0.15384615384615385,0.4631108712068462,0.8461538461538461,32

Don’t just skitter around like the village idiot tagging Russia and then running away.] On Thursday, Malta withdrew permission for a Russian Navy replenishment tanker to refuel at its port. UK and American diplomats had applied pressure to the Maltese government to deny access to the tanker, as they believed the fuel would be used to replenish the Admiral Kuznetsov battlegroup. The carrier and seven accompanying vessels are believed to be headed to Syria to support the siege of Aleppo. Earlier this week, Spain cancelled permission for the Kuznetsov’s auxiliaries to take on fuel at the North African port territory of Ceuta. The Spanish government had come under intense diplomatic pressure to deny access to the Russian vessels. Russian officials say that the Kuznetsov battlegroup carries enough supplies to be self-sustaining for at least 45 days, and several military spokespeople denied that they had ever asked for formal permission to call at Ceuta or Malta.",1,200,16.666666666666668,12,0.38,0,0,0,0,96.78901098901099,15.857142857142858,54,8.078125000000002,0.735,0,0.025,0.02,0.045,0.01,0.135,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.07,0,0.06,0.005,0,0.005,0.005,0.05,0,0.03,0.025,0.05,0.01,0,0.015,0.01,0.115,0,0,0,0,0,0.015,0.05,0,0,0.42,0.005,0.01,0,0,0.04,0.015,0,0.015,0.005,0.005,0,0,0.03,0.01,0.03,0.005,0,0.01,0.205,0.015,0,0.01,0.055,0.035,0.015,0.015,0.09,0.175,0.055,0.015,0.005,0,0.13,0,0.015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045,0.065,0.015,0.015,0.01,0.035,0.155,0.145,0.005,0.03,0,0,0,13.83,1,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,7.9,0,0,0,7.9,4,37.83,49.730000000000004,7.9,,0,0,0.47166057635050923,0.060635704539036266,0,0,0,0,0,0.5975277929028293,0,0,0.33772325998172403,0,0.060635704539036266,0,0.033799683395370726,0.017113763744491507,0.16185342061352842,0.21276686775339065,-0.7320631476772157,0.7872331322466093,16
211,"The future is dire, the past a blur and the present heartbroken yet hinting at possibilities on Radiohead’s “A Moon Shaped Pool,” its ninth studio album and perhaps its darkest statement  —   though the one with the band’s most pastoral surface. Radiohead worries throughout the album: about environmental devastation, about mass thoughtlessness, about love gone cold, about finding some way forward. “You’ve really messed up everything,” Thom Yorke sings in “Ful Stop,” one of the album’s few   songs, though it uses its insistent beat for jitters, not pleasurable motion. On this album, grim tidings arrive amid gorgeous backdrops: gentle pianos and acoustic guitars reinforced by a string orchestra. Multilayered tinklings and murmurings give the music a subliminally shimmering aura. But this is Radiohead, whose beauty is always laced with dread for the most part, “A Moon Shaped Pool” is an album of nightmare lullabies. In “Daydreaming,” a somber, undulating piano waltz, Mr. Yorke croons, “Beyond the point of no   it’s too late, the damage is done. ” The album’s opening track, “Burn the Witch,” is a spiral of tension, cryptically portraying a society ignoring its own witch hunts as a clattery, insistent string arrangement ratchets up the dissonance and agitation. Throughout the album, the state of the world and the state of the singer’s heart shade into one another. “When I see you messing me around, I don’t want to know,” Mr. Yorke sings in “Identikit,” and whether he’s thinking about personal, political or corporate betrayal  —   or just about the way facial features can be interchanged and messed around with in a police    —   is unclear, even after the   chorus arrives: “Broken hearts make it rain. ” In “Present Tense,” a bittersweet bossa nova akin to past Radiohead songs like “Knives Out” and “House of Cards,” Mr. Yorke sings, “As my world comes crashing  ’ll be dancing, freaking out” and wonders, “Will all this love have been in vain?” Mr. Yorke, 47, and his partner of 23 years, Rachel Owen, separated last year, releasing a statement that the parting was “perfectly amicable” at the end of “Daydreaming,” Mr. Yorke’s voice is played in reverse, repeating “Half my life. ” But the songs shouldn’t be reduced to autobiography. Radiohead, and Mr. Yorke on his own, have been playing some of the album’s material  —   ”Identikit,” “Present Tense” and “True Love Waits”  —   onstage for years as they painstakingly tinkered with them in the studio. “Burn the Witch” has been hinted at for more than a decade. Every hiss and creak on the album has probably been weighed and considered. “A Moon Shaped Pool” was five years in the making, a little longer than the   gaps between “Hail to the Thief” (2003) “In Rainbows” (2007) and “The King of Limbs” (2011). That’s how Radiohead works now, in fits and starts between Mr. Yorke’s side projects (Atoms for Peace, appearances at protests and benefit concerts) and the guitarist Jonny Greenwood’s soundtracks (among them “There Will Be Blood,” “The Master” and “Inherent Vice”) and collaborations (such as “Junun,” with the composer Shye Ben Tzur). The songs thrive on their coalition, melding Mr. Yorke’s troubled words and aching melodies with Mr. Greenwood’s textural mastery (including, presumably, the string arrangements) and the   contributions of the rest of the band. Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who don’t shy away from emotion. One thing Radiohead no longer worries about is digital technology. During the 1990s, when Radiohead made “OK Computer,” its songs warned desperately about technology’s incursions on individuality. But in Radiohead’s music now, technology is just a tool, ubiquitous and unremarkable, not the center of attention. “A Moon Shaped Pool” uses the studio extensively, but reveals the human activity there. Regardless of how it was assembled, the sound of the album is largely acoustic and analog: a little hazy, a little noisy, avoiding the metronomic. “Daydreaming” opens with that most analog of effects, a wavering pitch like a tape slipping  . The technology just helps capture and loop the tones of acoustic guitars, keyboards, percussion and voices, whether or not they’re fed through analog distortion gadgets it’s as amoral as a microphone or an amplifier. And the music sounds unplugged even where it’s obviously programmed. The results often hark back to the late 1960s in a way, “A Moon Shaped Pool” is Radiohead’s   album. “The Numbers,” which Radiohead fans have previously known as “Silent Spring,” counsels, “We are of the   her we do return,” and comes as close as Radiohead gets to a call to arms: “We’ll take back what is ours,” it insists. The production hints at Buffalo Springfield’s “Expecting to Fly,” with stately swells of guitar and gusts of strings. “Desert Island Disk” recalls the   folk experiments of Pentangle and the electronic phantasms of early Tim Buckley as Mr. Yorke envisions “the wind rushing ’round my open heart, an open ravine. ” Yet it’s the rare song on the album that offers a glimpse of hope  —   a feeling of being “totally alive, totally released. ” “Glass Eyes” starts as the bleakest of ballads, with minor piano chords drifting into the fog as the singer arrives in a frightening unknown town and finds, perhaps, an escape. “A path trails off and heads down the mountain,” he sings. “I don’t know where it   don’t really care. ” The album ends with “True Love Waits,” a love song Radiohead wrote in the 1990s and first recorded on a 2001 live EP, “I Might Be Wrong,” with Mr. Yorke simply strumming and singing alone, building up to the song’s pleading refrain, “Don’t leave, don’t leave. ” Two decades later, its studio version testifies to what Radiohead’s patient perfectionism can achieve. Instead of guitar chords, it starts with four repeating piano notes, a chord dissected and laid bare. The same piano figure sketches the song’s other chords through the first verse. Gradually, more pianos are overdubbed: in rippling loops, low resonant tones and repeated chords, not so much filling out the arrangement as emanating alongside it, somewhere between harmonious and oblivious. It’s a world that exists outside one man’s longings, and won’t be eclipsed by them.",0,1056,25.75609756097561,41,0.3134469696969697,0,0,0,0,93.08734725190422,29.151340996168578,57.1509324009324,15.171717171717171,0.7670454545454546,0.006628787878787879,0.04734848484848485,0.043560606060606064,0.054924242424242424,0.01231060606060606,0.2850378787878788,0.001893939393939394,0.00946969696969697,0.036931818181818184,0.10227272727272728,0.000946969696969697,0.056818181818181816,0.01893939393939394,0.007575757575757576,0.010416666666666666,0.00946969696969697,0.07954545454545454,0.005681818181818182,0.08712121212121213,0.026515151515151516,0.06723484848484848,0,0.001893939393939394,0.022727272727272728,0.004734848484848485,0.052083333333333336,0,0,0.005681818181818182,0.003787878787878788,0,0.007575757575757576,0.01893939393939394,0.001893939393939394,0.001893939393939394,0.4270833333333333,0.003787878787878788,0.041666666666666664,0.004734848484848485,0.007575757575757576,0.03314393939393939,0.002840909090909091,0.001893939393939394,0.017045454545454544,0.01231060606060606,0.04924242424242424,0.017992424242424244,0,0.017045454545454544,0.013257575757575758,0.029356060606060608,0.000946969696969697,0,0.01893939393939394,0.19412878787878787,0.005681818181818182,0.006628787878787879,0.054924242424242424,0.05113636363636364,0.06818181818181818,0.022727272727272728,0.021780303030303032,0.02462121212121212,0.13352272727272727,0.056818181818181816,0.013257575757575758,0.000946969696969697,0.09090909090909091,0.13920454545454544,0.000946969696969697,0.004734848484848485,0.007575757575757576,0.005681818181818182,0.007575757575757576,0,0.000946969696969697,0.004734848484848485,0.056818181818181816,0.07954545454545454,0.000946969696969697,0.021780303030303032,0.004734848484848485,0.04640151515151515,0.10700757575757576,0.10606060606060606,0.003787878787878788,0.015151515151515152,0.001893939393939394,54.45,0,34.65,3,17,10.9,18,27.25,11.175,92.725,4,12,47,4,54.45,0,127.625,35.9,195.625,342.7,127.625,,0.6553478869076313,0,0.5475175543089248,0.09482974892682876,0.37251584962598117,0.27570059353302884,0.38597088362489657,0.48760287907746563,0.2807038370412658,0.764045067455296,0.12256538371419255,0.2953072566843675,0.6214001584247824,0.12256538371419255,0.6840576019026892,0,0.09714927304559641,0.027327395904696655,0.14891147141660957,0.26086625561391485,-0.7705517186213744,0.7391337443860851,85
212,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Isaac Davis The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. So who is Kelcy Warren? A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nation’s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The company’s holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warren’s personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as “among America’s new shale tycoons” — but rather than building a fortune by drilling he “takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it’s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.” [ Source ] Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . “According to the governor’s office, the state parks and wildlife commission “manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,” along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.” [ Source ] This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren’s company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlife… Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren. Footage of militarized police using the Long Range Acoustic Device ( LRAD ) crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on October 27th, 2016: Final Thoughts Warren is listed as number 150 on Forbes list of wealthiest Americans with an estimated net worth of $4.2 billion in September of 2016. He is the head of the Dakota Access Pipeline snake. If you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating, gassing and attacking peaceful resistors , including women, children and the elderly, the answer is, they are doing it to protect the interests of Kelcy Warren and others invested in this pipeline project.

213,"posted by Eddie Cyndy Coppola was arrested for standing on her own property as she tried to block Dakota Access Pipeline construction equipment from crossing her land. Once again, the repression of those against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is heating up, with 127 activists arrested in North Dakota over the weekend. However, North Dakota isn’t the only place where protests over the Dakota Access pipeline are coming to a head. In Iowa, farmers have had their land seized by the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, through the use of eminent domain. Eminent domain has been legal in the US since 1888, thanks to the passage of the Condemnation Act . The law authorizes the federal government to take private property for public use. However, in 1906, the law was amended to allow for the seizure of private property even if it only benefited private parties (e.g., corporations), not the public. The argument for this was that corporate seizure of private land “helps” the public through economic development. Yet, what the law essentially means is that even your own land doesn’t belong to you if the government or government-supported corporations want it. A sad, yet accurate example of eminent domain gone wrong took place last week in Calhoun County, Iowa. Cyndy Coppola was arrested over the weekend on her own property for trying to block access to DAPL trucks from hauling pipeline construction materials through her land. DAPL first received access to Coppola’s farm through the use of eminent domain, which granted Energy Transfer Partners easements to her property. Coppola remarked that watching the morally wrong seizure of the farm she worked so hard for was difficult to handle. “It was very frustrating, and when I first saw that topsoil piled up when they started digging, my first reaction was to cry, because we’ve tried everything.” Coppola, as well as nine other local farmers, are suing Energy Transfer Partners for the seizure of their property. They are arguing that the move stands in complete violation of Iowa state law. The pipeline has generated controversy for most of this year, inspiring the largest gathering of Native American tribes in recent history to fight the project. They, as well as environmental activists, argue that the pipeline will poison the water and destroy the sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The evidence stands on their side, as the company that will be tasked with managing the pipeline after its construction has been responsible for more leaks than any of their competitors, with over 200 recorded leaks since 2010. The most recent of these happened over the weekend when a Sunoco pipeline leaked 55,000 gallons of gasoline into one of the nation’s most endangered rivers. Even the UN has officially condemned the project, asking the US federal government to end the project immediately. However, the federal government is openly supporting the crackdown on protestors, as well as journalists who are covering the story. Democracy Now’s Amy Goodman was charged with “participating in a riot” just for reporting on the issue. Though those charges were eventually dropped, the North Dakota State Attorney who initially charged her has vowed to look for new reasons to criminalize Goodman’s reporting. Goodman said that these actions send a chilling message to journalists, “don’t come to North Dakota.” The Dakota Access pipeline has proved, without a doubt, that private interests are the real beneficiaries of federal policy, allowing them to take what’s lawfully yours and even arrest you just for standing on your own property.

214,"The New York Times won three Pulitzer Prizes, and The New York Daily News and ProPublica shared the prize for public service, as journalism presented its highest honors on Monday at a time of steep financial challenges for the industry and unabashed antagonism from a new presidential administration. The Daily   joint effort won for a series on the New York Police Department’s widespread abuse of a   law to force people from their homes and businesses over alleged illegal activity. The investigation, which involved the examination of more than 1, 100 nuisance abatement cases, found that the Police Department almost exclusively targeted households and shops in minority neighborhoods. The reporting drove New York City to   the nuisance law and pass sweeping reforms. The Times won for breaking news photography, feature writing and international reporting. Daniel Berehulak won for a searing photo essay titled “They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals” that provided a haunting portrait of a violent drug crackdown in the Philippines. C. J. Chivers won for a magazine piece on a young veteran of the war in Afghanistan suffering from PTSD. At times dizzyingly detailed, Mr. Chivers’s account revealed the lasting effects of combat and violence. Reporters from The Times also won for international reporting for a series on Russia’s surreptitious assertion of power. The series, a collaboration among The Times’s international, Washington and investigative teams, explored how Russia was expanding its influence at home and abroad. David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post won the prize for national reporting for his work during the presidential campaign on Donald J. Trump’s charitable foundation. And Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal won the commentary award for columns that the Pulitzer board said “connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation’s most divisive political campaigns. ” Colson Whitehead’s brutal and surreal novel “The Underground Railroad” won the prize for fiction. The novel, which won the National Book Award last fall, centers on a young woman who escapes her life as a slave in Georgia and flees via a real subterranean network of train cars. Mr. Whitehead, 47, said in a phone interview on Monday that to be given even more recognition by the Pulitzer committee was “startling and wonderful,” adding with a laugh, “Obviously, it’s all downhill from here. ” Lynn Nottage’s play “Sweat,” about the American working class, was awarded the prize for drama. And the drama critic Hilton Als of The New Yorker won for criticism. The Pulitzers this year come as financial pressure drains many news organizations of the resources to pursue   journalism. They also come in the face of a combative stance from President Trump, who has called the news media “the enemy of the American people. ” But for one day, at least, newsrooms came together in celebration, and the journalism industry’s focus was on its accomplishments and purpose, rather than its woes. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, McClatchy and The Miami Herald shared the prize for explanatory reporting for their coverage of millions of leaked documents known as the Panama Papers. (The Herald also won in another category  —   Jim Morin was awarded the prize for editorial cartooning.) Eric Eyre of The Charleston   won the investigative reporting prize for coverage that laid bare the relentless flow of opioids into West Virginia counties with the highest rate of overdose deaths in the country. The East Bay Times of Oakland, Calif. won the breaking news reporting prize for its coverage of the “Ghost Ship” fire in December that killed 36 people at a warehouse party, chronicling the city’s failures that led to the tragedy. The prize for editorial writing was awarded to Art Cullen of The Storm Lake Times, a   newspaper in Iowa with a circulation of 3, 000, for editorials that held corporate agricultural interests accountable. The Times is owned by Mr. Cullen and his older brother.",0,654,21.096774193548388,31,0.3532110091743119,0,0,0,0,99,24.289436799184504,68.21450415028396,90.94521328979422,0.7844036697247706,0.05963302752293578,0.04281345565749235,0.01529051987767584,0.0856269113149847,0.01834862385321101,0.14220183486238533,0.012232415902140673,0.0030581039755351682,0.016819571865443424,0.12538226299694188,0,0.016819571865443424,0.010703363914373088,0.0030581039755351682,0.009174311926605505,0.0030581039755351682,0.035168195718654434,0,0.045871559633027525,0.021406727828746176,0.04281345565749235,0,0.00764525993883792,0.00764525993883792,0.0015290519877675841,0.11467889908256881,0,0.0015290519877675841,0.0015290519877675841,0.0030581039755351682,0,0,0.053516819571865444,0.0015290519877675841,0.0015290519877675841,0.38685015290519875,0.0061162079510703364,0.0061162079510703364,0.00764525993883792,0,0.03058103975535168,0,0,0.013761467889908258,0.00764525993883792,0.019877675840978593,0.009174311926605505,0.016819571865443424,0.01834862385321101,0,0.022935779816513763,0,0,0.01529051987767584,0.14984709480122324,0.0015290519877675841,0.0015290519877675841,0.012232415902140673,0.05198776758409786,0.12385321100917432,0.012232415902140673,0.06269113149847094,0.0382262996941896,0.15902140672782875,0.04281345565749235,0.01834862385321101,0,0.024464831804281346,0.1529051987767584,0,0.045871559633027525,0.0045871559633027525,0.0061162079510703364,0.0045871559633027525,0,0.0015290519877675841,0.0045871559633027525,0.053516819571865444,0.0856269113149847,0,0.0030581039755351682,0.0061162079510703364,0.047400611620795105,0.06880733944954129,0.07033639143730887,0.0015290519877675841,0.0871559633027523,0,104,7,93,0,0,13,0,15,80,54.25,9,43,12,0,104,0,189,13,158.25,357.25,189,,0.8068282545722189,0.21943711798921586,0.7888054147184077,0,0,0.3430097329217451,0,0.3759417416193974,0.7626325370798966,0.6854091930880992,0.2654882982630746,0.6332861143799585,0.325205021747331,0,0.6883621805493719,0,0.2020850040096231,0.013900026730820636,0.16920609462710506,0.38198342689120557,0.6358979352998099,0.6180165731087944,76
215,"Remnants of both vanquished American political empires, the Bushes and the Clintons, will attend   Donald J. Trump’s official swearing in as the next president of the United States, a major symbolic victory for the outsider and billionaire businessman who crushed both of them on his way to the White House. [Bill and Hillary Clinton —  the former president and first lady, the latter of whom was Trump’s general election opponent on Nov. 8 —  will attend the inauguration, according to a report in New York Magazine.  “Bill and Hillary Clinton have decided to attend the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, according to two sources with knowledge of their plans,” New York Magazine’s Yashar Ali wrote, adding later in his short piece on Tuesday afternoon: NEW: Pres. George W. Bush  wife will attend Donald Trump’s inauguration say they’re pleased to ”witness the peaceful transfer of power”  —   Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) January 3, 2017,  Former President Jimmy Carter, the failed Democratic president from the 1970s, will also be present —  as will outgoing President Barack Obama, who will officially transfer power to Trump on Jan. 20. It’s unclear whether former President George H. W. Bush, the elder Bush who succeeded the late former President Ronald Reagan, will attend. The elder Bush’s health has been an issue as of late. But the fact that both the Bushes and the Clintons will be present at Trump’s inauguration is a stunning development, as Trump’s meteoric rise to the White House went through both dynasties. Throughout the GOP primaries, Trump mocked and ridiculed George W. Bush’s younger brother former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush —  at the time the presumed GOP frontrunner who had millions upon millions of donor class dollars funneled into his campaign —  as “low energy. ” Trump ripped Jeb Bush apart, and blew past the other GOP candidates on his way to viciously winning the nomination to face off against Hillary Clinton in the general election. There, in the general election, Trump described Clinton as “Crooked Hillary” and even called “Heartless Hillary” at one point. He threatened to throw her in jail for her email scandal and her Clinton Foundation scandal —  something that still hasn’t been ruled out in the future —  as well as running one of the most vicious campaigns in American political history. He proved to be successful, winning a landslide 30 and a half states and 306 electoral votes on Nov. 8 —  officially closing the chapter of U. S. history where Americans had dynasties like the Bushes and the Clintons. Trump’s populist nationalist worldview once and for all defeated the globalist elitist Bushes and Clintons, and now they will witness him officially take power on Jan. 20 as Trump —  the   person to be elected to the highest office in the land without ever having served in government before —  takes the oath of office.",0,485,19.4,25,0.3649484536082474,0,0,0,0,97.16069193901266,23.681974383005315,66.01325478645066,22.572945954389255,0.7175257731958763,0.020618556701030927,0.07835051546391752,0.016494845360824743,0.03917525773195876,0.004123711340206186,0.17525773195876287,0.012371134020618556,0.002061855670103093,0.024742268041237112,0.09278350515463918,0,0.05154639175257732,0.004123711340206186,0.002061855670103093,0.002061855670103093,0.008247422680412371,0.03711340206185567,0.004123711340206186,0.04536082474226804,0.04329896907216495,0.05979381443298969,0,0,0.01443298969072165,0,0.08453608247422681,0,0.004123711340206186,0,0.010309278350515464,0,0.02268041237113402,0.032989690721649485,0,0,0.3917525773195876,0.002061855670103093,0.002061855670103093,0.004123711340206186,0,0.020618556701030927,0.004123711340206186,0,0.008247422680412371,0.01443298969072165,0.006185567010309278,0.016494845360824743,0.008247422680412371,0.024742268041237112,0.004123711340206186,0.020618556701030927,0.002061855670103093,0.002061855670103093,0.03917525773195876,0.22474226804123712,0.026804123711340205,0.002061855670103093,0.006185567010309278,0.05154639175257732,0.06804123711340206,0.0288659793814433,0.018556701030927835,0.06597938144329897,0.1463917525773196,0.049484536082474224,0.018556701030927835,0,0.020618556701030927,0.16494845360824742,0,0.016494845360824743,0.004123711340206186,0.006185567010309278,0.004123711340206186,0,0,0.020618556701030927,0.0577319587628866,0.08247422680412371,0,0.006185567010309278,0.006185567010309278,0.05979381443298969,0.10103092783505155,0.07422680412371134,0,0.05154639175257732,0.002061855670103093,23,0,32.05,1,10,0,0,19,12.83,10,5,18,1,0,23,0,54.83,2,65.05,121.88,54.83,,0.5070470750016679,0,0.589038772030325,0.042806973496989774,0.3090169943749474,0,0,0.45937349442417297,0.3645851709041266,0.3090169943749474,0.1827439976315568,0.44597861335205763,0.042806973496989774,0,0.3090169943749474,0,0.0950457634170018,0.0034669255304396063,0.11276175287754818,0.21127444182498958,-0.39260295616540236,0.7887255581750104,30
216,"Barack Obama has been very busy pardoning a growing list of drug dealers, domestic terrorists, killers, and other criminals as his last days in office wind down, but so far he has pardoned neither Edward Snowden, Bowe Bergdahl nor Chelsea Manning  —   and speculation is now focused on these names as possible beneficiaries of Obama’s overheated pen. [Already President Obama has overtaken the   record by pardoning 78 and commuting the sentencing of another 153 criminals, most of whom are in jail for drug trafficking.  Despite that we are living through an epidemic of opioid drug overdoses and deaths across the nation, Obama freed or gave clemency to dozens of criminals convicted of manufacturing and selling illicit drugs including crack cocaine, heroin, and more. Thousands of dollars in fines owed by these criminals were also excused. But there is a large number of people petitioning for Obama’s favors, among them the three notorious figures most currently in the news: Snowden, Bergdahl, and Manning, The Daily Mail notes. It may seem likely that Obama could pardon traitor Bergdahl not only because of the link to Islam but because of the gentle treatment Obama afforded the traitorous soldier’s parents. The President’s sympathy for the LGBTQ community may also make a pardon for secrets leaker Chelsea Manning a possibility. But because of his connection to this purported Russian hacking and with Obama’s sudden broadsides against Russia after Hillary Clinton’s loss, a pardon for NSA leaker Edward Snowden may seem less likely. All three are plausible possibilities, despite the outcry by many against Snowden’s pardon. But there are others being thrust before Obama, too. Bernie Sanders, for instance, wants Obama to pardon Puerto Rican terrorist Oscar López Rivera, the founder of the FALN terror group. FALN is responsible for at least six deaths, 130 serious injuries, and 114 bombings perpetrated throughout the 1970s. Also on the list is hapless, corrupt former Illinois Governor Rob Blagojevich, a corrupt Illinois politician who tried to buy the Senate seat Obama vacated to become president. Another on the possible list is murderer Leonard Peltier, a Native American activist who killed two FBI agents in 1975. Whoever Obama adds to his long list of pardons and commutations, though, he has already achieved the record of bestowing presidential favors to more criminals than any other president in history.

217,"In times of great stress, or of flickering,   dread, I find that canceling all my plans and staying in to make mashed potatoes generally helps. This year, there were quite a few opportunities to do so.   anxiety gnawed at me for months, lighting up old networks of pain in my shoulders and back. Mold bloomed around the mysterious wet patch that appeared in my bedroom ceiling. I started a thrilling, but terrifying, new job. And as the holidays neared, I worried about my grandmother, almost 80, living alone. Still, I let about half her calls go to voice mail each week, and hated myself for it. I turned to aligot, the   mashed potatoes with roots in central France. Aligot doesn’t fix anything, but it does put a little cushion between you and the abyss, whatever form the abyss might take. To make it, you’ll need a ricer. You could, technically, blitz everything together in the food processor, but you risk potatoes with the gooey, elastic texture of an   glue, setting up between planks. If you’re in a delicate emotional state, as I usually am when I start these potatoes, it’s better not to risk it. Besides, pressing down on the ricer is an essential part of the process. Squashing hot, tender potatoes through tiny holes is a pure and simple joy, one of the rare cooking tasks that’s just as fun as those   sets once had you believe. The potato rushes out in tiny, twirling, noodles. You don’t need to worry about lumps. In France, aligot is traditionally made with tomme fraîche or unripened Cantal, but those cheeses can be hard to find. At North End Grill, a restaurant in Manhattan’s Battery Park City, the chef Eric Korsh makes aligot with a little bit of roasted garlic and a lot of Comté. Any cheese that melts well will do, but for aligot you also want to seek out a cheese with a capacity for stringiness. I’ve had great aligot with Comté, Gruyère and Emmental, and fresh mozzarella can also work in a pinch. Ham   a chef at the Brooklyn diner Hail Mary, starts with Robuchon potatoes. Among cooks, the phrase “Robuchon potatoes” is shorthand for what many still consider the Platonic ideal of mashed potatoes: a flawless purée, mounted with an obscene amount of butter and named for the celebrity French chef Joël Robuchon. In a video dedicated to his famous mashed potatoes, Robuchon leans over a cook and says in French, quite sternly: “More butter! More butter! More butter! More butter! More, more, more!” Robuchon uses ratte potatoes  —   an expensive variety from France. He boils them whole, then peels them while hot. After pushing the potatoes through a food mill, he adds loads of cold butter over the heat and finally some milk or cream, whisking the whole thing until it’s an airy,   cloud. Waylly starts around there, then adds a mix of Gruyère and a   cow’s milk cheese from Vermont, even throwing in part of the bloomy rind. The key, he told me, is to whip the potatoes with confidence, vigor and speed once you add the cheese, to build up the stringiness as it melts. “When you pull it, you want it to seem like you’re pulling at fondue,” Waylly said. “You want to see a good amount of strands falling, and they should have some strength. They should fight with you. ” Stringiness is the whole point of aligot, that long, delightful stretch, the way it takes on all the qualities of melted cheese but remains mashed potato. And though it’s tough to get it like the cooks in Auvergne, some of whom can pull spoonfuls of hot aligot that stretch several feet, you can still get a good, cheesy texture as a beginner, working with a small amount of potato over low heat. At home, in the 20 minutes or so it takes for the potatoes to cook through, I like to get the rest of the meal going. I brown sausages and wilt a big bunch of greens in the same pan. I have a glass of whatever wine is open in the fridge. By now, things are looking up. Cheesy mashed potatoes are on the horizon, like sunshine after a long, dark night. And by the time those potatoes are ready, so am I.

218,"From the first piece headlined James Comey is damaging our democracy : First, the FBI director, James B. Comey, put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case — which is not the job of the FBI — but also best practices in the handling of email and other matters. Now, he has chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness , departing from the department’s traditions. From the second piece by notorious mud-slinger Dana Milbank: I’ve long believed in Comey’s integrity. But if he doesn’t step forward and explain his October Surprise, he may inadvertently wind up interfering in the political process — perhaps even reversing the outcome of a presidential election — in a way that would have made J. Edgar Hoover gape. And the third strike : FBI Director James B. Comey’s stunning announcement that he has directed investigators to begin reviewing new evidence in the Clinton email investigation was yet another troubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nation’s chief investigative official . Back to the July 7 editorial: “It appears damage is being done to the rule of law,” Mr. Ryan said. He’s right, but the FBI director isn’t doing the damage. The wreckers are those who cast baseless aspersions on U.S. law enforcement in the service of their partisan goals . I for one believe that Comey was wrong in July and is right today. He should have pressed for charges against Clinton early on. Using a ""secret"" private email server for confidential state business is not legal and would have been out of bounds for anyone else. Now possible new evidence was found and must be investigated. It is not Comey's job to ask if the timing of a renewed investigation is convenient for the potential culprit. He also had to inform Congress because he had reasonably promised to do so. (He also needed to save his ass before anyone else in his department talked to the media.) The so called ""election"" of a U.S. president is always a sorry show. But this season's version has at least some amusing moments. Seeing the hypocrites at Fred Hyatt's Funny Pages™ squirm is one of them. It makes me smirk.

219,"By REBECCA PERRING For years Sweden has regarded itself as a “humanitarian superpower” – making its mark by offering refugee to those fleeing war and persecution. But people’s patience with their visitors is wearing thin following a year of violence, sickening sex assaults and the death of social worker Alexandra Mezher , 22, who was knifed to death at an asylum centre for unaccompanied children at the hands of a Somalian migrant who claimed he was 15. At the time, her grieving mother, an immigrant herself from the Middle East said: “Immigration has destroyed Sweden.” Sweden, a country of 9.8million, took 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015. The influx included 35,400 unaccompanied minors – nine times more than 2015. But nothing could prepare Stockholm for the rise in crime and an abuse of the criminal system. And so much so, a nation, which once prided itself on giving a warm welcome to outsiders, has reported a rise in arson attacks against migrant shelters, while support for the right-wing Swedish Democrats has surged. In January, authorities were forced to admit there were at least 70 girls in migrant centres were asylum child brides, according FOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK",1,196,24.5,8,0.3979591836734694,0,0,0,0,97.51554626805304,21.796718687474993,77.79715522572666,4.760300346553715,0.7755102040816326,0.01020408163265306,0.03571428571428571,0.015306122448979591,0.061224489795918366,0.01020408163265306,0.16326530612244897,0.025510204081632654,0,0.00510204081632653,0.09183673469387756,0,0.05612244897959184,0.015306122448979591,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,0.05612244897959184,0.00510204081632653,0.07653061224489796,0.025510204081632654,0.05102040816326531,0.00510204081632653,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.00510204081632653,0.07142857142857142,0,0.00510204081632653,0.01020408163265306,0.025510204081632654,0,0.00510204081632653,0.04081632653061224,0,0,0.41836734693877553,0,0.01020408163265306,0,0,0.03571428571428571,0,0,0.01020408163265306,0.015306122448979591,0,0.00510204081632653,0,0.02040816326530612,0.00510204081632653,0.04081632653061224,0,0,0.04591836734693878,0.20918367346938777,0.01020408163265306,0,0.02040816326530612,0.04081632653061224,0.030612244897959183,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.05102040816326531,0.15816326530612246,0.05612244897959184,0.02040816326530612,0,0.02040816326530612,0.15306122448979592,0,0.00510204081632653,0.00510204081632653,0.00510204081632653,0,0,0.00510204081632653,0.015306122448979591,0.10204081632653061,0.10714285714285714,0,0,0.00510204081632653,0.03571428571428571,0.08163265306122448,0.10204081632653061,0,0.01020408163265306,0,1,0,63,0,1,0,0,10,0,26,8,0,2,0,1,1,11,1,77,88,11,,0.07326484679668878,0,0.8327923417268492,0,0.07326484679668878,0,0,0.44151844011225283,0,0.6727192312838924,0.38742588672279304,0,0.1365270594958143,0,0.600332825010961,0.07326484679668878,0.041666666666666664,0.003787878787878788,0.2916666666666667,0.3333333333333333,-0.880654362474288,0.6666666666666667,20
220,"An unarmed man who was fatally shot in Bakersfield, Calif. by an officer who thought he had a gun was actually carrying a crucifix, the police say. The family of the man, Francisco Serna, 73, who said he had dementia, is demanding a Justice Department investigation into the actions of the Police Department, which previously came under scrutiny for its use of deadly force. The Bakersfield police chief, Lyle Martin, said at a news conference  on Tuesday that officers did not find a gun on Mr. Serna after he was killed on Monday and that the department was conducting its own investigation into the shooting. According to the police, a woman who lives across the street from Mr. Serna was removing items from a vehicle outside her home when she noticed a man standing behind her. He turned out to be Mr. Serna. She said he asked if he could get in the car. He was allowed only to look into the vehicle, and the woman went inside her house, the chief said. The woman later said she had believed that Mr. Serna had a firearm because his hand was in his jacket, and she saw an object with a handle, the chief said. She told her husband about the encounter, and he called the police to report a man outside with a gun. “He is brandishing a firearm,” the husband said, according to a recording of the 911 call, which was published by KERO television station. He said the man was an “older Mexican gentleman” and that it looked like the firearm was a revolver. “He could be the neighbor across the street or a visitor I am not for sure. ” When officers arrived, the woman pointed out Mr. Serna as he left his house, Chief Martin said. The police said they shouted to Mr. Serna to take his hands out of his jacket and to stop walking toward them. But he continued and entered the woman’s driveway, officials said. Mr. Serna was about 15 to 20 feet away when Officer Reagan Selman fired seven times, the chief said. Mr. Serna, who the police said was hit by five of the bullets, fell. Efforts by the police and medics to revive him were not successful. Chief Martin said that he was “unable to describe” the object found with Mr. Serna. But Sgt. Gary Carruesco later said a “dark colored simulated wood grain” crucifix was found. “We thought we were dealing with an armed subject,” Chief Martin said. He said that officers did not have any information about Mr. Serna’s dementia and that they had to make a decision about the use of force in 20 to 30 seconds. He said there was no indication the older man had been “lunging or threatening or anything of that nature. ” Officer Selman joined the force in July 2015, and it was the first time he had been involved in such a shooting, the police said. He and the other officers were placed on administrative leave while the case was investigated, the chief said. Mr. Serna’s family said he had dementia and would take short walks in the neighborhood to help him sleep, The Associated Press reported. Symptoms of dementia can include confusion and wandering, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. At a vigil on Tuesday night, a family spokeswoman said Mr. Serna’s relatives had asked for an investigation by the  Department of Justice and for the California attorney general to appoint an independent investigator, The Los Angeles Times reported. The shooting has prompted renewed calls for greater scrutiny of the use of force by the police in Bakersfield, the biggest city in Kern County, where the police in 2015 killed more people per capita than in any other county in the United States, an investigation by The Guardian showed. Chief Martin, who was promoted to his position this week, said that once he has his command staff in place, he will meet with local groups that have called for greater openness about the department’s use of force. “This is a very delicate situation,” he said.",0,688,20.848484848484848,33,0.2761627906976744,0,0,0,0,94.50276854928018,3.2175909361955877,93.2670002943774,28.189147286821704,0.8546511627906976,0.007267441860465116,0.020348837209302327,0.020348837209302327,0.015988372093023256,0.02180232558139535,0.15406976744186046,0.00436046511627907,0.0014534883720930232,0.00872093023255814,0.12209302325581395,0,0.07267441860465117,0.014534883720930232,0.005813953488372093,0.0188953488372093,0.0014534883720930232,0.06395348837209303,0,0.056686046511627904,0.01744186046511628,0.0377906976744186,0,0.007267441860465116,0.020348837209302327,0.005813953488372093,0.11627906976744186,0,0.00872093023255814,0.00436046511627907,0.020348837209302327,0,0.0014534883720930232,0.11773255813953488,0.0029069767441860465,0.0029069767441860465,0.4898255813953488,0.00436046511627907,0.03924418604651163,0.01744186046511628,0.0014534883720930232,0.03924418604651163,0,0.00436046511627907,0.01308139534883721,0.01744186046511628,0.007267441860465116,0.0755813953488372,0.00872093023255814,0.020348837209302327,0.007267441860465116,0.007267441860465116,0,0,0.01744186046511628,0.22529069767441862,0,0,0.05232558139534884,0.06540697674418605,0.07848837209302326,0.06686046511627906,0.00872093023255814,0.08139534883720931,0.13662790697674418,0.10610465116279069,0.005813953488372093,0,0.023255813953488372,0.12790697674418605,0.0029069767441860465,0.007267441860465116,0.00436046511627907,0,0.00872093023255814,0,0,0.05813953488372093,0.17587209302325582,0.07267441860465117,0,0.011627906976744186,0.00436046511627907,0.03488372093023256,0.15988372093023256,0.16424418604651161,0.0029069767441860465,0.050872093023255814,0,9.625,0,49.45,0,0,6,0,2,1.83,39.075,7,8,7,0,9.625,0,33.455,6,81.075,114.905,33.455,,0.2725434864618281,0,0.6581007969069773,0,0,0.18933139574356017,0,0.0722270279186898,0.0664959690738573,0.6033308014553407,0.21412971538676237,0.237455908152084,0.21412971538676237,0,0.03746656321294425,0,0.04339704632866566,0.007783060169540995,0.10516860054092268,0.14905208813018467,-0.7238632968780687,0.8509479118698153,32
221,"Congressman Jim Jordan, former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, spoke with Breitbart News about his thoughts on President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. [Jordan said, “Neil Gorsuch. Jeff Sessions. I mean the cabinet, the executive orders, the travel ban, the things we’re seeing on the federal hiring freeze, the regulatory freeze, and eliminating two regulations for every regulation proposed, I think we’re off to a great start. I think this is exactly what the campaign was about. I think that’s all very positive. ”  Jordan told Breitbart News that confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice and Jeff Sessions as attorney general were his two favorite moments of the last 100 days. He explained: So much of the campaign was about the Supreme Court and the Justice Department becoming so politicized under Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. Neil Gorsuch I believe was first in his class all the way from kindergarten to high school. I think Gorsuch was an outstanding pick. Those two things show how amazing it is to have Donald Trump in the White House as compared to Hillary Clinton. There’s even been a marked decrease in illegals crossing the border since this administration has been in office and Jeff Session has served as attorney general. Congressman Jordan echoed the sentiments of Congressman Meadows, saying that the House Republicans soon will strike a deal on health care. He said: You know we haven’t passed health care yet, but I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll get it done in the next week or two. Our chairman Mark Meadows has been working very hard over this break. So I think there’s a chance to get an amendment put in the bill that will result in premiums coming down for a lot of American families. I think that we can get it done in a way that is consistent with what we told voters we’re going to do. Jordan continued, “I think that our jobs are too complicated, the voters sent us to repeal Obamacare, reform a broken tax code that’s not conducive to economic growth. I think that’s the attitude of the White House. My attitude is that we’re off to a good start. I think there’s a chance that we get Obamacare repeal and get that done in the next couple of weeks. That’s what we’ve been trying to do. ” The Ohio congressman supports the president’s initiative to reorganize the federal government and cut down on waste, fraud, and abuse. He said, “I fully support the president and hope that we can help the president restructure and trim down the government. As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee it should be a big focus, we have a number of Freedom Caucus members to help and support that. ” Jordan summarized his thoughts on Trump’s first 100 days, he said, “Winning beats losing every single time. So let’s keep putting up wins for the American people. ”",0,510,18.214285714285715,28,0.296078431372549,0,0,0,0,79.11539060068472,23.508417508417516,77.18478906714202,79.40522875816994,0.8333333333333334,0.01764705882352941,0.052941176470588235,0.03529411764705882,0.041176470588235294,0.041176470588235294,0.15098039215686274,0.00196078431372549,0,0.03725490196078431,0.09019607843137255,0,0.08235294117647059,0.00392156862745098,0,0.00980392156862745,0.011764705882352941,0.08235294117647059,0.00392156862745098,0.0392156862745098,0.013725490196078431,0.047058823529411764,0,0.00196078431372549,0.00784313725490196,0.0058823529411764705,0.14313725490196078,0,0.00196078431372549,0.0058823529411764705,0,0,0.013725490196078431,0.047058823529411764,0,0,0.46078431372549017,0.00392156862745098,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.027450980392156862,0.056862745098039215,0,0,0.03725490196078431,0.00784313725490196,0.00392156862745098,0.01568627450980392,0.0058823529411764705,0.01568627450980392,0.00392156862745098,0.0058823529411764705,0,0,0.021568627450980392,0.27058823529411763,0.00196078431372549,0,0.025490196078431372,0.052941176470588235,0.08823529411764706,0.07647058823529412,0.03529411764705882,0.07254901960784314,0.11568627450980393,0.13333333333333333,0.01568627450980392,0,0.01568627450980392,0.11568627450980393,0,0.021568627450980392,0.00392156862745098,0.00196078431372549,0.00784313725490196,0,0,0.01568627450980392,0.0803921568627451,0.056862745098039215,0,0.013725490196078431,0,0.041176470588235294,0.17058823529411765,0.1784313725490196,0.03137254901960784,0.07058823529411765,0.00196078431372549,23,0,15,0,0,9.7,7,17,7,21.625,25,15,20.65,0,23,2,77.65,16.7,52.625,140.97500000000002,77.65,,0.492881936940796,0,0.3879545880178417,0,0,0.290729745195993,0.228278344279431,0.4180569197445531,0.228278344279431,0.47748565035348917,0.5137234106159754,0.3879545880178417,0.4659893326647697,0,0.2970504159217058,0.0779292055122247,0.12606031088924063,0.027111489914363407,0.08543366208044158,0.22886480782499294,0.5992834864043789,0.771135192175007,35
222,"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while discussing the U. S. missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to a deadly chemical attack, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called President Donald Trump’s decision one of his “finest hours. ”  Haley said, “What happened this week was really one of the president’s finest hours. ” She continued, “He wanted to know exactly what the facts and evidence was. He wanted to know what the options were, what the risks were, and the political strategy and solution side of it. After all of that, he made a very, you know, strong decision and I think it was one that was very good for the world. ” She added, “He won’t stop here “If he needs to do more, he’ll do more. Really, now what happens depends on how everyone responds to what happened in Syria and make sure that we start moving toward a political solution and we start finding peace in that area. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,179,14.916666666666666,12,0.25139664804469275,0,0,0,0,76.97721831241384,18.596658110624592,84.27587124235168,67.9756584197925,0.8603351955307262,0.01675977653631285,0.0446927374301676,0.03910614525139665,0.0446927374301676,0.0223463687150838,0.22905027932960895,0.00558659217877095,0.00558659217877095,0.027932960893854747,0.0782122905027933,0,0.05027932960893855,0,0,0.03910614525139665,0.027932960893854747,0.15083798882681565,0,0.0670391061452514,0.027932960893854747,0.05027932960893855,0,0,0.01675977653631285,0.0223463687150838,0.09497206703910614,0,0,0,0.0111731843575419,0,0.0111731843575419,0.0782122905027933,0,0,0.4860335195530726,0,0.00558659217877095,0,0.00558659217877095,0.0782122905027933,0.01675977653631285,0,0.055865921787709494,0.03910614525139665,0.00558659217877095,0.03910614525139665,0,0.0111731843575419,0.00558659217877095,0.0111731843575419,0.01675977653631285,0,0.01675977653631285,0.2737430167597765,0.00558659217877095,0.00558659217877095,0.00558659217877095,0.061452513966480445,0.027932960893854747,0.0782122905027933,0.0335195530726257,0.0335195530726257,0.11731843575418995,0.1564245810055866,0.0223463687150838,0,0.061452513966480445,0.1452513966480447,0,0.0111731843575419,0.0111731843575419,0,0,0,0,0.0446927374301676,0.1005586592178771,0.07262569832402235,0,0.01675977653631285,0,0.061452513966480445,0.16759776536312848,0.16201117318435754,0.0111731843575419,0.0223463687150838,0.01675977653631285,12.25,0,6,0,13,0,8,0,0,11,4.25,6,4,0,12.25,0,35.25,8,16,59.25,35.25,,0.4415698008524078,0,0.2791745113185196,0,0.4562694929969814,0,0.3405424265831667,0,0,0.4152207330514819,0.21527780066697194,0.2791745113185196,0.20521309615767264,0,0,0,0.15932203389830507,0.03615819209039548,0.07231638418079096,0.2677966101694915,0.637323284052925,0.7322033898305085,17
223,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] Justin Bieber Defecates On Adoring Irish Fans From Hotel Window November 1, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , ENTERTAINMENT Share 0 Add Comment JUSTIN Bieber fans gathering outside the Shelborne hotel this evening were rewarded by the pop star after he took a large dump from an overlapping balcony, causing a stampede of adoring fans to gather below and smear themselves with the falling excrement. Men, women and children of all ages pushed and tugged each other as they desperately positioned themselves under the hotels three story window, while the 22-year-old squatted over the side, before then squeezing several pieces of spent food from his anus. “Let the younger ones through,” Bieber ordered fans, as he let loose for a third time while being supported by two large security guards, “Make sure everyone gets some. There’s enough to go round. “Rub it in. Sing with me ‘You know you love me, I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there'” he bellowed. Following several slips and falls, with one fan breaking her ankle, Gardai were later called to the scene and kindly asked the American heartthrob to stop defecating from the Shelbourne balcony and to go inside. “He must have been there for a good twenty minutes, just crapping on everyone,” eyewitness Mark Dunphy told WWN, “That young fella is full of shit. The fans lapped it up. I don’t think I’ll ever forget what I saw tonight”. Mr. Bieber is in town for a sold-out concert at Dublin’s 3Arena tonight and tomorrow as part of his Purpose world tour.",1,273,22.75,12,0.2857142857142857,0,0,0,0,88.64656039930765,34.94641161307829,82.95848595848597,84.10361067503925,0.8351648351648352,0.007326007326007326,0.047619047619047616,0.02564102564102564,0.054945054945054944,0.02197802197802198,0.19047619047619047,0.003663003663003663,0.003663003663003663,0.02197802197802198,0.06227106227106227,0,0.054945054945054944,0.02564102564102564,0.014652014652014652,0.014652014652014652,0.02197802197802198,0.054945054945054944,0.003663003663003663,0.05860805860805861,0.02564102564102564,0.054945054945054944,0.014652014652014652,0,0.003663003663003663,0.003663003663003663,0.08791208791208792,0,0,0.014652014652014652,0.007326007326007326,0,0.02197802197802198,0.040293040293040296,0,0,0.42857142857142855,0,0.01098901098901099,0.014652014652014652,0.02564102564102564,0.029304029304029304,0.003663003663003663,0.007326007326007326,0.01098901098901099,0.007326007326007326,0.02564102564102564,0.03296703296703297,0.007326007326007326,0.02564102564102564,0.003663003663003663,0.01098901098901099,0,0,0.03663003663003663,0.2564102564102564,0.007326007326007326,0,0.03296703296703297,0.047619047619047616,0.05128205128205128,0.08058608058608059,0.04395604395604396,0.03296703296703297,0.14652014652014653,0.10989010989010989,0.029304029304029304,0,0.03663003663003663,0.17582417582417584,0,0.018315018315018316,0.01098901098901099,0,0.01098901098901099,0,0,0.02564102564102564,0.11355311355311355,0.07326007326007326,0.003663003663003663,0.003663003663003663,0.01098901098901099,0.07692307692307693,0.13553113553113552,0.13553113553113552,0.007326007326007326,0.003663003663003663,0.01098901098901099,3.45,0,2,0,4,0,0,20.8,14,4,14.25,8.83,41,0,3.45,0,72.08,0,28.8,100.88,72.08,,0.1821355787663712,0,0.11433841851550565,0,0.20521309615767264,0,0,0.5731301162559329,0.47470607699125783,0.20521309615767264,0.47912150886829813,0.36304679649799304,0.7257673360319109,0,0.11433841851550565,0,0.20660398991057097,0,0.08254987388213712,0.2891538637927081,0.7980167417978479,0.710846136207292,25
224,"WHO Cancer Agency Under Fire for withholding ‘carcinogenic glyphosate’ Documents IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review RT.com - October 27, 2016 Comments The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate. The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from “external interference,” as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was “the sole owner of such materials.” The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC – a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) – labeled the glyphosate herbicide as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsanto’s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name ‘Roundup.’ It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified “Roundup Ready” crops, also produced by Monsanto. The IARC’s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries – including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate’s EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC’s evaluations are fuel for “unnecessary health scares,” since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a “typical human” exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and…freedom from conflicts of interest.” Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. E&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, it’s being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from “conflicts of interest.” According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. “IARC’s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,” a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency’s activities. IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is “unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,” promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its “commitment to open risk assessment.” The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.

225,"BREAKING: Trump Set to Break 50-Year-Old Record With Black Voters “Black lives don’t matter to Hillary Clinton. Black votes matter to Hillary Clinton,” he said. In his speeches, Trump has promised black voters across America that he will actually work to improve their lives if he is elected. Trump often asks blacks, rhetorically, “What do you have to lose?” when asking for their vote. Advertisement - story continues below America’s inner cities are a mess, and poverty and crime are decimating black families across America. Decades of Democrat leadership in major cities have done nothing to improve the lives of millions of black Americans. What Trump is offering is an alternative — a chance at a better future. All Clinton wants to do is promise more hope and change and then spend four years breaking her promises . Democrat solutions to inner city problems don’t work. Republicans may not be perfect, but they believe that every American can succeed if given the opportunity to do so. Trump wants to give every American a chance to succeed. He wants to rebuild the inner cities, bring back jobs and increase education so black Americans everywhere can escape the cycle of poverty and flourish.

226,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   As the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approached, jihadist propagandists told their followers that it was a good time to kill people. The spokesman for the Islamic State said in late May that jihadists should “make it, with God’s permission, a month of pain for infidels everywhere. ” Another extremist distributed a manual for using poisons, adding, in poor English: “Dont forget Ramadan is close, the month of victories. ” A bloody month it has been, with terrorist attacks killing and wounding hundreds of people in Orlando, Fla. Istanbul Dhaka, Bangladesh and now Baghdad, where a bomb killed more than 140 people early Sunday in a shopping area full of families who had just broken their Ramadan fasts. For the vast majority of the world’s Muslims, violence is completely dissonant with the holy month, which in addition to fasting is a time for spiritual renewal, prayer and visits with friends and family. It is widely believed that the rewards earned for noble acts are greater during Ramadan, which culminates in the Eid holiday this week. Jihadists have perverted this belief to serve their own ends, analysts said. In short: If one believes it is good to kill those who are considered infidels, all the better to do so during Ramadan. “There is no doubt in my mind that Al Qaeda, its various affiliates and now ISIS use Ramadan as a watershed, as a marker to inspire and motivate their followers and supporters worldwide,” said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics who has written books on jihad. While not all of them may have been carried out with Ramadan in mind, the month has seen a stunning array of attacks. A gunman opened fire in a nightclub in Orlando, killing 49. A suicide attack on an army post in Jordan killed seven soldiers. Suicide bombers killed dozens of civilians in Al Mukalla, Yemen, and in a Christian village in Lebanon, on the same day. The next day, attackers struck  Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, killing at least 41. In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian assailants killed two Israeli civilians over two days: stabbing a    girl while she was asleep in her home in a Jewish settlement and gunning down a man on the road. On Friday, gunmen stormed a restaurant in Dhaka’s diplomatic quarter, letting some Muslims escape but killing at least 22, most of them foreigners. And on Sunday, a bombing took at least 143 lives in Baghdad. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has claimed responsibility for many of the attacks and is the prime suspect in others. A large share of the victims have been Muslims, belying the Islamic State’s claim to be the defender of their faith. “We were happy and preparing to break the last day of the fasting month very soon and to celebrate Eid, but our feelings have been stained with blood,” said Hadi   a shopkeeper who was hit with flying glass in the attack in Baghdad. Many large attacks occurred during Ramadan last year, too, hitting a Tunisian beach resort, a Shiite mosque in Kuwait, a Kurdish town in northern Syria and African Union troops in Somalia. But terrorism researchers caution that attacks happen   and that there is little systematic evidence that they become more common during Ramadan. And it is almost impossible to tell what role the month plays in the thinking of individual attackers. What is clearer is that the manipulation of the goals of Ramadan are another way in which jihadists have interpreted the religion in a way most Muslims deplore. Another example is the jihadists’ wide use of takfir, or the branding of others as infidels who deserve death. The Islamic State has used this concept to justify the killing of other Muslims, be they Shiites or fellow Sunnis whom the group deems to be insufficiently devout. Such views course through the jihadists’ Ramadan propaganda. In an audio message released before the month began, Abu Muhammed   the Islamic State spokesman, urged the group’s followers to launch attacks in the West during Ramadan in retaliation for strikes by a United   coalition in the group’s central territories in Syria and Iraq. “Know that in the heart of the lands of the Crusaders there is no protection for that blood, and there is no presence of   civilians,” he said. Jihadists should act, he said, “so that perhaps you will gain the great reward for martyrdom in Ramadan. ” Other propagandists reached back into Islamic history to compare the modern jihadist struggle to the Battle of Badr, a famous Ramadan victory mentioned in the Quran in which the Prophet Muhammad and his forces routed their enemies in Mecca. Some drew links between those forces and Omar Mateen, the Orlando gunman. “In Islamic history, Ramadan is a reminder to Muslims of who they are, separating the faithful from the ” Professor Gerges said. “But what ISIS and Al Qaeda have done to great effect is to focus on the war spirit and offensive spirit rather than on the moral spirit. ” The recent spate of attacks could be less about Ramadan than about the Islamic State’s desire to project strength as it loses territory. In Iraq, it recently lost control of Ramadi and was pushed out of Falluja last month  —   a humiliating Ramadan defeat. Since those losses undermine the jihadists’ claim to have a powerful state with its own territory,   attacks abroad serve as “force multipliers, because they divert attention from what is happening in Iraq and Syria,” Professor Gerges said. The jihadists’ focus on violence during the holy month stirs revulsion among most Muslims, who see it as a time of intensified spirituality and increased religious activity, said Jonathan A. C. Brown, a professor of Islamic civilization at Georgetown University. This often means more time spent in prayer, at the mosque or reading the Quran, in addition to the    fast that is among the primary requirements of observant Muslims. Even many secular Muslims fast or pursue good works throughout Ramadan. “If you do your fast well and it is received, there is a huge reward you get in the afterlife,” Dr. Brown said. Underlying much Ramadan activity is a sense that the rewards for good deeds are greater during the holy month, even for acts as small as smiling at someone, Dr. Brown said. Muslims are to give contributions to charity equaling the cost of one meal at the end of the month, and many also give their required alms for the year during Ramadan, making it an active time for thinking about the poor. Many Muslim communities also hold Ramadan   drives for charitable causes. There is also a belief that the devils who normally tempt people to sin are “chained up” during Ramadan, making it easier for Muslims to be good, as they have to face only their own temptations. “This is a time to improve yourself and not to swear, not to have arguments  —   and you have a leg up now,” Dr. Brown said. “That means that people who do these attacks only have themselves to blame. They can’t blame the devil. ”",0,1196,22.566037735849058,53,0.33277591973244147,0,0,0,0,95.73939186326389,31.713170887083933,70.3833467881444,5.8363062058714235,0.8444816053511706,0.01588628762541806,0.05351170568561873,0.030100334448160536,0.06856187290969899,0.01254180602006689,0.14464882943143811,0.027591973244147156,0.004180602006688963,0.010869565217391304,0.09782608695652174,0,0.061036789297658864,0.014214046822742474,0.005852842809364548,0.01588628762541806,0.0033444816053511705,0.07190635451505016,0.002508361204013378,0.061036789297658864,0.029264214046822744,0.05016722408026756,0,0.01254180602006689,0.020066889632107024,0.007525083612040134,0.08444816053511706,0,0.0016722408026755853,0.002508361204013378,0.002508361204013378,0,0.005852842809364548,0.03177257525083612,0.004180602006688963,0.004180602006688963,0.4707357859531773,0.005852842809364548,0.01254180602006689,0.002508361204013378,0.0008361204013377926,0.05434782608695652,0.0016722408026755853,0.0016722408026755853,0.020066889632107024,0.01588628762541806,0.007525083612040134,0.004180602006688963,0.008361204013377926,0.011705685618729096,0.006688963210702341,0.043478260869565216,0,0.0008361204013377926,0.010869565217391304,0.20234113712374582,0.002508361204013378,0,0.021739130434782608,0.04598662207357859,0.12040133779264214,0.025919732441471572,0.02508361204013378,0.04598662207357859,0.16220735785953178,0.0802675585284281,0.02508361204013378,0,0.021739130434782608,0.15217391304347827,0.07692307692307693,0.01839464882943144,0.005852842809364548,0.002508361204013378,0.005852842809364548,0,0.0008361204013377926,0.004180602006688963,0.07525083612040134,0.08528428093645485,0.0008361204013377926,0.01588628762541806,0.014214046822742474,0.056856187290969896,0.10535117056856187,0.10702341137123746,0.0016722408026755853,0.01839464882943144,0.005016722408026756,75.5,0,267.675,0,10,2,39,64.42500000000001,8,59.75,51.55,29,40.95,13,75.5,0,169.25,46,422.50000000000006,631.9999999999999,169.25,,0.6987011669606044,0,0.8915586224638479,0,0.23497542908541055,0.057874320439771615,0.545015170291156,0.6642941376727723,0.1972501300578266,0.6472920251053849,0.6129050734189537,0.47110317156978526,0.557084941590339,0.28535278956070975,0.5958466421016304,0,0.09944183313748531,0.02702702702702703,0.24823736780258523,0.37132784958871906,-0.9166699793681314,0.6286721504112809,126
227,"The Daily Show‘s Trevor Noah and Michelle Wolf mercilessly mocked Megyn Kelly’s NBC debut this week, in which the former Fox News star landed a   interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin on her newsmagazine show Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. [After playing clips of the interview, host Noah brought out Daily Show correspondent Wolf, who said that seeing someone “so conniving trying to manipulate the American public was disgusting. ”  When Noah said he agreed that watching Putin’s responses was indeed disgusting, Wolf said she was referring to Kelly. “Last night on her new show, she acted like she didn’t spend the last 12 years of her life as a soldier in Fox News’ culture war,” Wolf said. The Daily Show then played a clip from Kelly’s NBC show in which she chided the media for its “rude behavior” and asked “Can’t we all just get along?” “Oh, I’m sorry, now we’re all supposed to be friends?” Wolf continued. “Now that you’re NBC you’re acting all peaceful like some sort of Mahatma Blondie?” “Let’s not forget, before she was ‘NBC News’s Megyn Kelly,’ for over a decade she was ‘Fox News’s Megyn Kelly,’ basically a pretty,   puppet who Roger Ailes kept trying to put his hand up,” Wolf added, drawing a loud groan from the audience. “Oh, don’t worry, she’s on network now and he’s dead, they’re both in better places. ” Wolf didn’t let up for the whole segment, blasting Kelly for acting what she described as “high and mighty” when she told Axios in a recent interview that she only consumes news by print. “Sorry Megyn, you’re not the new Barbra Walters, you’re that   guy who just follows the money,” she concluded. Kelly’s contentious interview with Putin at an international economics forum in St. Petersburg  —   in which the pair discussed allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election  —   drew mixed reaction from fellow journalists and middling ratings for NBC.

228,"Exactly two weeks ago, this author predicted the defeat of the American Health Care Act  —   and explained that it was a step towards the final, actual deal that will repeal and replace Obamacare. [President Donald Trump faces three irreconcilable factions: the GOP establishment, conservatives, and Democrats. He must bring them together  —   to “deliver the goods,” a key rule in The Art of the Deal. But first he must show them “the downside”  —   and convince them they will fail on their own.  The most difficult faction to deal with is the Republican establishment  —   not because they are politically strong, but because on policy issues like health care, they are convinced that they have all the answers and that Trump just does not understand. So he let them make the first move  —   and he exposed two things about them: first, that they had not come up with a plan that was ready for prime time second, that they had not done any of the political legwork necessary to sell their plan to voters. Trump gave Speaker Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership enough rope to hang themselves. Instead of dictating terms to him, they will now depend on him to save them, politically. They must accept whatever plan he will put forward. But Trump will not make the next move. He will let the conservatives move first. They are the big winners in the first round  —   much more so than the Democrats, who are enjoying the spectacle of Republican dysfunction but have no role to play yet. The conservatives will proceed with their demand for a full repeal of Obamacare. And then they will face the ire of voters who are deeply unhappy with Obamacare but upset about losing the paltry, expensive health insurance they currently have. That, too, will strengthen Trump, and convince conservatives they need his leadership. Whereupon Trump will turn to the moderate Democrats and offer them a deal  —   perhaps catastrophic health coverage in exchange for repealing Obamacare. Democrats would take that deal because they would see a   catastrophic insurance system as a possible path to the universal health care system of their dreams. Republicans would take that deal  —   after exhausting all of the other options  —   because it would leave enough room for the free market to provide insurance for most health issues, and for states to experiment with their own policies. And the more health care stakeholders who can be brought into the process, the better.

229,".@CLewandowski_: ”I think Jim Comey is in big trouble. .. Jim Comey is a liar.” pic. twitter.  Saturday on “Fox  Friends,” former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski accused former FBI Director Jim Comey of being a “liar” who is looking to turn his spotlight into a major book deal.  “I think Jim Comey’s in big trouble because under oath in front of the committee he said things which we know to be factually inaccurate, not just in his testimony this week, but when he was the director of the FBI he’s had to come back and recant statements that he’s made   …     because Jim Comey’s a liar,” Lewandowski said. Lewandowski went on to address a rumor that Comey is about to sign a lucrative book deal, saying it is just another example of the Washington D. C. “swamp creatures” being “very real. ” “[W]hat we saw this week, I’m shocked by this news, is Jim Comey’s about to sign a $10 million book deal, right?” he continued. “It’s amazing how these guys go from government service to   and people wonder why Washington is broken. This is what happens all the time. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0,202,14.428571428571429,14,0.22772277227722773,0,0,0,0,74.15394442670073,15.267798208392273,81.35375970029436,2.9617123562067182,0.7475247524752475,0,0.0297029702970297,0.04455445544554455,0.034653465346534656,0.024752475247524754,0.2722772277227723,0.01485148514851485,0,0.034653465346534656,0.0594059405940594,0,0.08415841584158416,0.0049504950495049506,0,0.024752475247524754,0.009900990099009901,0.06930693069306931,0.0049504950495049506,0.039603960396039604,0.009900990099009901,0.034653465346534656,0,0,0.009900990099009901,0,0.07425742574257425,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04455445544554455,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.43564356435643564,0,0.01485148514851485,0.009900990099009901,0.01485148514851485,0.06930693069306931,0.01485148514851485,0.0049504950495049506,0.024752475247524754,0.0297029702970297,0.024752475247524754,0.039603960396039604,0,0.024752475247524754,0.0049504950495049506,0.0297029702970297,0.01485148514851485,0,0.009900990099009901,0.24257425742574257,0.0297029702970297,0,0.0297029702970297,0.07920792079207921,0.06435643564356436,0.0594059405940594,0.0049504950495049506,0.039603960396039604,0.1188118811881188,0.12871287128712872,0.009900990099009901,0.0049504950495049506,0.07920792079207921,0.13366336633663367,0,0,0.009900990099009901,0,0.01485148514851485,0,0,0.034653465346534656,0.10891089108910891,0.06930693069306931,0,0.0049504950495049506,0,0.04455445544554455,0.15346534653465346,0.16336633663366337,0.009900990099009901,0.04455445544554455,0,10,0,31.6,0,0,4,0,3,0,13.6,0,0,3,0,10,10,13,14,36.6,61.6,13,,0.3740666961489728,0,0.6537948998419955,0,0,0.19292728076790167,0,0.15202805015514587,0,0.4483536112928088,0,0,0.15202805015514587,0,0.23006275550355904,0.3740666961489728,0.051669316375198726,0.05564387917329094,0.14546899841017488,0.24483306836248014,-0.666061574821801,0.7551669316375198,12
230,"Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle has suggested she would be interested in replacing Sean Spicer as White House press secretary, amid reports Spicer could soon be released from the role. [In an interview with Mercury News, Guilfoyle said: “I’m a patriot and it would be an honor to serve the country. I think it’d be a fascinating job. It’s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position. ”  Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that President Trump was considering Guilfoyle as a replacement for Spicer, whose time as press secretary has been marked by a number of gaffes and mistakes. An anonymously sourced report by ABC News also alleges that Trump is furious with his communications team over recent media narratives and could fire both Spicer and his communications director Mike Dubke. Guilfoyle, 48, is the former first lady of San Fransisco, having been married to former city’s former mayor Gavin Newsom and served as its deputy district attorney from 2004 until 2006. She currently works as a   on talk show The Five on the Fox News channel. “I think I have a very good relationship with the president. I think I enjoy a very straightforward and authentic, very genuine relationship, one that’s built on trust and integrity, and I think that’s imperative for success in that position,” Guilfoyle added. “Sean Spicer is a very nice man and a patriot. He’s dedicated himself to this public service. Very tough position he’s in. I wish him the best and I know he puts a lot of effort into it. ” Responding to the rumors, a Fox News spokesperson said: “Kimberly is a valued member of the FOX News primetime lineup, and is under a   contract with the network. ” Meanwhile, Guilfoyle said through a spokesperson: “As I stated in the interview, I really love what I do and my job   The Five is tough to beat. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0,357,19.833333333333332,18,0.28291316526610644,0,0,0,0,83.05531212484993,12.18912326835496,79.17569249922191,81.34097963509728,0.803921568627451,0.03081232492997199,0.058823529411764705,0.03081232492997199,0.047619047619047616,0.03081232492997199,0.17086834733893558,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.022408963585434174,0.0896358543417367,0,0.08683473389355742,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.06162464985994398,0.008403361344537815,0.05322128851540616,0.03361344537815126,0.06442577030812324,0,0,0.008403361344537815,0.0196078431372549,0.08403361344537816,0,0.0028011204481792717,0.008403361344537815,0.008403361344537815,0,0.0056022408963585435,0.036414565826330535,0,0,0.47619047619047616,0,0.014005602240896359,0.0028011204481792717,0.036414565826330535,0.04481792717086835,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.025210084033613446,0.0056022408963585435,0.011204481792717087,0.025210084033613446,0,0.011204481792717087,0,0.0056022408963585435,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.0196078431372549,0.22408963585434175,0.011204481792717087,0,0.028011204481792718,0.047619047619047616,0.06442577030812324,0.0700280112044818,0.036414565826330535,0.022408963585434174,0.13165266106442577,0.11484593837535013,0.008403361344537815,0,0.028011204481792718,0.11764705882352941,0,0.014005602240896359,0.0028011204481792717,0,0.0056022408963585435,0,0,0.028011204481792718,0.12044817927170869,0.06722689075630252,0,0.008403361344537815,0,0.0392156862745098,0.13725490196078433,0.13165266106442577,0,0.05322128851540616,0.0056022408963585435,48.125,0,13,0,0,19,4,4,2,7,7.25,5,29.125,0,48.125,0,75.25,23,17,113.25,75.25,,0.7172273742068805,0,0.4065845942048879,0,0,0.5003467408047562,0.17411239489546831,0.17411239489546831,0.09535767393825997,0.26950373545682293,0.27646782912730067,0.20856217852254144,0.6055261495944461,0,0,0,0.16900617630544637,0.05165637282425604,0.0381807973048849,0.2543514879281303,0.8127936328234584,0.7456485120718697,25
231,"Clinton’s Campaign Chairman John Podesta Invited to an Occult ‘Spirit Cooking’ Dinner by Marina Abramović November 4, 2016 190 The Podesta e-mails released by Wikileaks contain various bizarre entries, including an invitation to a ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner from notorious occultist Marina Abramović. These parties include blood, semen, breast milk … and God knows what else. A leaked e-mail reveals that John Podesta was invited to a ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner by Marina Abramović in 2015. John David Podesta is the Chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. He previously served as Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton and Counselor to President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, 2011. - Advertisement - Here’s the leaked e-mail . Marina Abramovic sent an e-mail to Tony Podesta (John Podesta’s brother) who then forwarded it to his brother. Before going any further, here’s a video of Marina preparing a ‘Spirit Cooking’ ritual. Yes, the process involves buckets of congealed pig’s blood. Marina paints on walls instructions coded in classic occultist matter. Spirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. Strange fact: In another leaked e-mail , Podesta contacts his doctor about an infected finger. Strange coincidence. Further in the video, Marina drenches in blood a statue shaped like a small child. Why do I have the sick feeling that actual children might be used during these ceremonies? Why would an occultist such as Marina Abramović be in direct and friendly contact with people at the highest levels of power? Because they are all part of the OCCULT ELITE. Marina Abramović Marina Abramović is considered to be the “grandmother of performance art”. Most of her work however takes place in private settings where she conducts magick rituals. She is an important and powerful figure in pop culture and is greatly influential in Hollywood, the fashion world and the music business. Marina ‘training’ Lady Gaga in the ‘Abramovic Method’. Marina performing with Jay-Z. Marina is an “occult pop culture” icon. Here are symbolic pictures celebrating this fact. On this cover of Vogue Ukraine, Marina represents the stronghold of occultism on the fashion world. In the same photoshoot, Marina is holds a goat’s head by the horns – a classic way of representing the drawing of magickal power from Baphomet. Same photoshoot: Marina standing in front of a model with inner body parts exposed while doing an occult handsign. This picture was featured in The New Yorker along with a lengthy article praising her career. A serpent hiding one eye: The perfect way of representing a member of the occult elite. Marina on the cover of ELLE with one eye hidden. Mimicking Baphomet horns. “Cleaning the Mirror”, 1995. Another interesting fact: Marina’s Twitter name is @AbramovicM666 This is why the term ‘occult elite’ is used to describe the highest level of power. Do you see the dots connecting?

232,"It is entirely possible, as many have argued, that Hillary Clinton would be the   of the United States if the F. B. I. director, James Comey, had not sent a letter to Congress about her emails in the last weeks of the campaign. But the electoral trends that put Donald J. Trump within striking distance of victory were clear long before Mr. Comey sent his letter. They were clear before WikiLeaks published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. They were even clear back in early July, before Mr. Comey excoriated Mrs. Clinton for using a private email server. It was clear from the start that Mrs. Clinton was struggling to reassemble the Obama coalition. At every point of the race, Mr. Trump was doing better among white voters without a college degree than Mitt Romney did in 2012  —   by a wide margin. Mrs. Clinton was also not matching Mr. Obama’s support among black voters. This was the core of the Obama coalition: an alliance between black voters and Northern white voters, from Mr. Obama’s first win in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to his final sprint across the   Midwestern Firewall states where he staked his 2012   bid. In 2016, the Obama coalition crumbled and so did the Midwestern Firewall. The countryside of Iowa or the industrial belt along Lake Erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the Obama coalition. Yet it was an important component of his victory. Campaign lore has it that President Obama won thanks to a young, diverse,   and metropolitan “coalition of the ascendant”  —   an emerging Democratic majority anchored in the new economy. Hispanic voters, in particular, were credited with Mr. Obama’s victory. But Mr. Obama would have won   even if he hadn’t won the Hispanic vote at all. He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004. Largely overlooked, his key support often came in the places where you would least expect it. He did better than John Kerry and Al Gore among white voters across the Northern United States, despite exit poll results to the contrary. Over all, 34 percent of Mr. Obama’s voters were whites without a college degree  —   larger in number than black voters, Hispanic voters or   whites. He excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota, along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine. In these places, Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history. In 2016, Mr. Trump made huge gains among white   voters. It wasn’t just in the places where Democratic strength had been eroding for a long time, like western Pennsylvania. It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong, like Scranton, Pa. and eastern Iowa. It was a decisive break from recent trends. White voters without college degrees, for the first time, deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans. No bastion of white,   Democratic strength was immune to the trend. For the first time in the history of the two parties, the Republican candidate did better among   whites than among affluent whites, according to exit poll data and a compilation of New York   News surveys. According to exit polls, Mr. Trump did better than Mr. Romney by 24 points among white voters without a degree making less than $30, 000 a year. He won these voters by a margin of 62 to 30 percent, compared with Mr. Romney’s narrow win of 52 percent to 45 percent. In general, exit poll data should be interpreted with caution  —   but   polls show a similar swing, and the magnitude of the shifts most likely withstands any failings of the exit polls. Mrs. Clinton’s profound weakness among Northern white   voters was not expected as recently as six months ago. She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white   voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start. Most of Mr. Obama’s strength among white voters without a degree was due to his gains among those under age 45. But Mr. Trump expanded on Republican gains among older   white voters, according to Upshot estimates, while erasing most of Mr. Obama’s gains among younger Northern white voters without a degree. His gains among younger   whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white   voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. Mr. Obama’s strength among them  —   and Mrs. Clinton’s weakness  —   was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries. Mr. Trump’s gains among white   voters weren’t simply caused by Democrats staying home on Election Day. The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. Its models, based on survey data, indicated that they were underperforming Mr. Obama in   white areas by a wide margin  —   perhaps 10 points or more  —   as early as the summer. The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white   voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump. The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Those polls aren’t affected by changes in turnout. The best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data, which will include an   account of who voted and who didn’t. Most of this data is only beginning to become available. But the limited data that’s already available is consistent with the story evident in the   polling: Turnout wasn’t the major factor driving shifts among white voters. The   data in North Carolina, where nearly all of the state’s jurisdictions have reported their vote, shows that the turnout among white Democrats and Republicans increased by almost the exact amount  —   about 2. 5 percent. The same appears to be true in Florida. Nationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white   areas, whether turnout surged or dropped. The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama’s performance, including 8 percent of those who “strongly” approved of Mr. Obama’s performance and 10 percent of white   voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama’s policies. Mr. Trump won 20 percent of   liberal white   voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama’s. It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white,   voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier. The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional   spectrum. Mr. Trump, if anything, was Mr. Obama’s opposite. But the two had the same winning pitch to white   voters. Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave   jobs prey to globalization and corporations. The proof of Mr. Obama’s commitment to the working class and Mr. Romney’s callousness, according to the Obama campaign, was the auto bailout: Mr. Obama protected the auto industry Mr. Romney wrote “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt” in The New York Times. There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed   policies that would reduce the production and use of coal. In retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of   interests. Mr. Trump owned Mr. Obama’s winning message to autoworkers and Mr. Romney’s message to coal country. He didn’t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy he promised to restore it and “make America great again. ” Just as Mr. Obama’s team caricatured Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump caricatured Mrs. Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, bought by special interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said. According to Mr. Trump’s campaign, the proof of his commitment to the working class wasn’t the auto bailout but the issue of trade: Mr. Trump said free trade was responsible for deindustrialization, and asserted that he would get tough on China, renegotiate Nafta and pull out of the   Partnership  —   two trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton supported or helped negotiate (she later rejected the   deal). Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment  —   and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn’t out to help ordinary Americans. Taken together, Mr. Trump’s views on immigration, trade, China, crime, guns and Islam all had considerable appeal to white   Democratic voters, according to Pew Research data. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion,   marriage and the social safety net. None of this is to say that changes in turnout didn’t help Mr. Trump at all. It’s just not the reason he made such large gains among white   voters. There was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout, or the change in turnout and Democratic strength. But the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November. It wasn’t a broad Democratic turnout problem. It was a black turnout problem. The turnout probably increased among all major groups of voters  —   Hispanics, white Democrats, white Republicans  —   except black voters. The conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms, and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout. In Georgia, the black share of the electorate fell to 27. 6 percent from 29. 9 percent, and in Louisiana it fell to 28. 5 percent from 30. 1 percent, according to the completed state turnout data. The data is not yet final in North Carolina, but the black share of the electorate looks unlikely to reach 21 percent of voters  —   down from 23 percent in 2012. The data is even less complete in Florida, but there too it appears that black turnout will fall by a similar amount  —   perhaps to 12. 7 percent of voters from 14 percent. In all of these states, the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004. It just wasn’t as high as it was with Mr. Obama at the top of the ticket. Young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline. They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, causing the black share of registered voters to dip. And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago. The data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country, but it tells a similar story. Turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia, while rising everywhere else in the city. The turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent. Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population, like Milwaukee and Flint, Mich. It’s hard to know just how much of this is lower black turnout instead of black population decline  —   the census can struggle to make population estimates in places with a declining population  —   but the turnout certainly dropped faster than the reported population decline. Taken in totality, it appears that black turnout dropped somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent  —   with few exceptions. It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country, regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout, like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID. Was the decline in black turnout enough to change the result of the election? It seems so. If black turnout had matched 2012 levels, Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close. But pinning Mrs. Clinton’s loss on low black turnout would probably be a mistake. Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support. (He would have won Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin each time even if Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee had been severed from their states and cast adrift into the Great Lakes.) Perhaps more important, the Clinton campaign’s models and public polls all assumed lower black turnout  —   and still showed Mrs. Clinton on track for victory. The Clinton campaign believed it could compensate for the loss of the Obama coalition by winning the   “rising American electorate” or “coalition of the ascendant” of   voters and Hispanic voters  —   a caricature of the Obama coalition. These demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade, but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states. This year, the exit polls again exaggerated the importance of   and Hispanic voters. Last time, it was said that these voters won the election for Mr. Obama  —   and this time that they lost it for Mrs. Clinton. According to the exit polls, Mrs. Clinton fared a tad worse among white voters  —   but much worse among Hispanic,   and black voters than Mr. Obama. And those polls said she didn’t win   white voters, as many   polls indicated. But the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns, census and   polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among   white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply. It is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary. They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling. But it nonetheless paints an alternative picture that’s more consistent with the actual results,   polls and the consensus of academics and campaign analysts on the electorate. The Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree (although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well). Mrs. Clinton’s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and   white voters, much as Mr. Trump’s gains were concentrated among the   and   white voters. She gained 17 points among white postgraduates, according to Upshot estimates, but just four points among whites with a bachelor’s degree. There was a similar pattern by income. Over all, she picked up 24 points among white voters with a degree making more than $250, 000, according to the exit polls, while she made only slight gains among those making less than $100, 000 per year. These gains helped her win huge margins in the most   and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy, like Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Washington, Seattle, Chicago and Boston. There, Mrs. Clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the Republicans. Scarsdale, N. Y. voted for Mrs. Clinton by 57 points, up from Mr. Obama’s   win. You could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of Boston before reaching a town where Mr. Trump hit 20 percent of the vote. She won the affluent   suburbs of Seattle, like Mercer Island, Bellevue and Issaquah, by around 50 points  —   doubling Mr. Obama’s victory. Every   Republican enclave of western Connecticut, like Darien and Greenwich, voted for Mrs. Clinton, in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction. Every precinct of Winnetka and Glencoe, Ill. went to Mrs. Clinton as well. Her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent Republican suburbs, like those edging west of Kansas City, Mo. and Houston north of Atlanta, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio or south of Charlotte, N. C. and Los Angeles in Orange County. Mrs. Clinton didn’t always win these affluent Republican enclaves, but she made big gains. But the narrowness of Mrs. Clinton’s gains among   voters helped to concentrate her support in the coasts and the prosperous but safely Republican Sun Belt. It left her short in     suburbs, like those around Philadelphia, Detroit and Tampa, Fla. where far fewer workers have a postgraduate degree, make more than $100, 000 per year or work in finance, science or technology. A similar divide may have helped obscure whether Mrs. Clinton improved among Hispanic voters, a question addressed in depth by Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. Mrs. Clinton was expected to excel among Hispanic voters, because of Mr. Trump’s proposals to deport undocumented workers, his plans to build a wall along the Southern border and his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. The   polls generally showed Mrs. Clinton poised to make good on that possibility. But the exit polls show a marked decrease in Democratic strength, with Mrs. Clinton winning just 66 percent of the Hispanic vote, down from Mr. Obama’s 71 percent in 2012. Mrs. Clinton plainly fared worse than Mr. Obama in many heavily Hispanic areas  —   like South Texas or South Colorado. Our estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton did about the same as Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters over all. The estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily Hispanic areas: Mrs. Clinton may have faltered among Hispanic voters without a high school degree, while making gains among those with some college education or better. Nationwide, Mrs. Clinton’s success in reviving the elements in the caricature version of the Obama coalition really did let her compensate for losses among black voters and   whites. She won the popular vote. But it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states.",0,3053,19.445859872611464,157,0.3219783819194235,0,0,0,0,95.07719860187893,20.62287852870886,61.85934389881327,70.74294362808769,0.7504094333442516,0.028824107435309533,0.06845725515886014,0.03144448083851949,0.041925974451359316,0.008516213560432362,0.16377333770062233,0.000982640026203734,0.000982640026203734,0.017359973796265967,0.0799213887979037,0,0.05568293481821159,0.0013101867016049786,0,0.014412053717654767,0.012446773665247298,0.09924664264657714,0.001965280052407468,0.046511627906976744,0.03930560104814936,0.05175237471339666,0,0,0.037667867671143135,0.011791680314444808,0.10448738945299706,0,0.0006550933508024893,0.000982640026203734,0.015722240419259743,0,0.004585653455617425,0.05273501473960039,0.00032754667540124465,0.00032754667540124465,0.42188011791680313,0.0013101867016049786,0.0016377333770062235,0.00032754667540124465,0.0006550933508024893,0.03832296102194563,0.000982640026203734,0,0.008843760235833607,0.010809040288241074,0.0016377333770062235,0.03242712086472322,0.006223386832623649,0.014412053717654767,0.011136586963642319,0.008516213560432362,0.00032754667540124465,0.0006550933508024893,0.025548640681297086,0.22174909924664266,0.00917130691123485,0.000982640026203734,0.031116934163118243,0.0835244022273174,0.029806747461513267,0.021945627251883395,0.03242712086472322,0.07075008188666886,0.15263675073698002,0.06059613494923027,0.028824107435309533,0.00032754667540124465,0.003930560104814936,0.14051752374713397,0.0006550933508024893,0.021945627251883395,0.0055682934818211596,0.0036030134294136916,0.028496560759908286,0,0.00032754667540124465,0.015067147068457255,0.07861120209629872,0.09564362921716345,0,0.02587618735669833,0.0052407468064199145,0.03144448083851949,0.08843760235833606,0.09335080248935473,0.00032754667540124465,0.026203734032099576,0.0006550933508024893,127.5,0,70,1,19.75,12,16,37.75,110.95750000000001,66,57.7,124,57,0,127.5,0,382.65749999999997,28,199.75,603.4075,382.65749999999997,,0.694687725506744,0,0.5553981799351523,0.017532877637619498,0.2606032436604941,0.176377982260965,0.22211208268786461,0.4025133771023182,0.6644432112812554,0.5408253357761664,0.5073165112317899,0.6887522752405637,0.5042654536165764,0,0.5819345018512116,0,0.1115161926993515,0.00815991688541801,0.058212264209365976,0.17584839457278098,0.8219426759109514,0.824151605427219,225

234,"Pregnancy changes a woman’s brain, altering the size and structure of areas involved in perceiving the feelings and perspectives of others, according to a     study published Monday. Most of these changes remained two years after giving birth, at least into the babies’ toddler years. And the more pronounced the brain changes, the higher mothers scored on a measure of emotional attachment to their babies. “Just fascinating,” said Dr. Ronald E. Dahl, director of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. He said the researchers’ interpretation that changes in the brain enhance women’s maternal responses is “provocative, and I think it’s likely to be true. ” In the study, researchers scanned the brains of women who had never conceived before, and again after they gave birth for the first time. The results were remarkable: loss of gray matter in several brain areas involved in a process called social cognition or “theory of mind,” the ability to register and consider how other people perceive things. What might the loss mean? There are three possibilities, said Paul Thompson, a neuroscientist at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the study. “The most intuitive is that losing gray matter is not beneficial, that later on there may be negative consequences. ” Or, he said, it could be just a “neutral” reflection of   “stress, diet, lack of sleep. ” A third possibility is that the loss is “part of the brain’s program for dealing with the future,” he said. Hormone surges in pregnancy might cause “pruning or cellular adaptation that is helpful,” he said, streamlining certain brain areas to be more efficient at mothering skills “from nurturing to extra vigilance to teaching. ” The study strongly leans toward the third possibility. “We certainly don’t want to put a message out there on the lines of ‘pregnancy makes you lose your brain,’ as we don’t believe this is the case,” said Elseline Hoekzema, a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who led the study at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona in Spain. “Gray matter volume loss does not necessarily represent a bad thing,” she said. “It can also represent a beneficial process of maturation or specialization. ” Pregnancy, she explained, may help a woman’s brain specialize in “a mother’s ability to recognize the needs of her infant, to recognize social threats or to promote   bonding. ” The study, which took more than five years, involved 25 women in their 30s in Spain who had never been pregnant but were hoping to conceive. Their brains were scanned before becoming pregnant and within few months after giving birth. For comparison, 20 women who had never been pregnant were also scanned twice, about the same number of months apart. Only the pregnant women showed gray matter reduction, thinning and changes in the surface area of the cortex in areas related to social cognition. Changes were so clear that imaging results alone could indicate which women had been pregnant. The researchers said they did not yet know what was being reduced in size: neurons, other brain cells, synapses or parts of the circulatory system. Many of the women had been recruited for the study at a fertility clinic, and the 16 who conceived after fertility treatment were compared with nine who conceived naturally. The treatments caused no difference in brain changes nor did the sex of the babies. The researchers also scanned the brains of 17 men who were not fathers and 19   fathers before and after their partners’ pregnancies. The two male groups showed no difference in brain volume. Researchers wanted to see if the women’s brain changes affected anything related to mothering. They found that relevant brain regions in mothers showed more activity when women looked at photos of their own babies than with photos of other children. Six months after giving birth, the mothers answered questions on the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale, used to assess a woman’s emotional attachment, pleasure and hostility toward her baby. The degree of changes in the mothers’ gray matter volume predicted the degree of hostility and attachment, Dr. Hoekzema said. Experts said more research was required, involving more women and clearer assessments of social cognition to substantiate whether gray matter loss is truly linked to “theory of mind” and improved mothering skills. But there are some precedents for making that connection. A 2014 study showed “people with better spontaneous ‘theory of mind’ also have less gray matter volume in pretty much exactly these regions,” said Rebecca Saxe, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new research. During another period of roiling hormonal change  —   adolescence  —   gray matter decreases in several brain regions that are believed to provide   for the social, emotional and cognitive territory of being a teenager. “We think it is creating plasticity for learning, not that adolescent brains are wacko or making them crazy,” said Dr. Dahl of the University of California, Berkeley. Perhaps there is “a similar turbulent period around pregnancy,” he said. In the study, the women’s cognitive abilities were tested before and after pregnancy, and “there was no loss of memory, verbal skills or working memory,” Dr. Saxe noted, providing “evidence against the common myth of ‘mommy brain.’ ” Two years after they gave birth, scans of the brains of 11 women who had not had second children showed the same gray matter loss in the same areas, except for an area in the hippocampus, which had regained volume. Dr. Thompson said it was notable that the hippocampus, important in memory, appeared to recover, possibly because of all the learning and activity required of new mothers. “That boost in the memory system is something that many of us in neuroscience would give our eyeteeth to achieve,” he said. Brain areas lose volume “like the erosion of the coast, but there are not many things that put the coast back. ” Many questions remain. Pilyoung Kim, an assistant professor of developmental psychology at the University of Denver, who was not involved in the study, said her research had found that some brain regions increased in size in the months after giving birth. She said she wondered if maternal brain areas waxed and waned during and after pregnancy. Dr. Hoekzema is continuing the research, including in one very personal way. “I was pregnant with my first child when analyzing these data, but unfortunately I couldn’t get the before and after M. R. I. scans of my first pregnancy,” she said. Now, she is 20 weeks pregnant, with her second child. “Yes, I’ve certainly scanned myself before getting pregnant,” she said, “and will go into the scanner again after birth!”",0,1135,21.01851851851852,54,0.35330396475770925,0,0,0,0,92.93317614940746,30.175372351583814,81.55887605667341,25.774193548387096,0.8599118942731278,0.02378854625550661,0.06167400881057269,0.027312775330396475,0.03788546255506608,0.013215859030837005,0.18590308370044054,0.0026431718061674008,0.001762114537444934,0.01762114537444934,0.08634361233480176,0.000881057268722467,0.06431718061674009,0.04669603524229075,0.02290748898678414,0.022026431718061675,0.010572687224669603,0.12246696035242291,0.001762114537444934,0.06696035242290749,0.03788546255506608,0.04317180616740088,0,0,0.033480176211453744,0.009691629955947136,0.06167400881057269,0.000881057268722467,0.03259911894273128,0.000881057268722467,0.03436123348017621,0,0.007048458149779736,0.06431718061674009,0.000881057268722467,0.000881057268722467,0.4511013215859031,0.02290748898678414,0.018502202643171806,0,0.007048458149779736,0.044933920704845816,0.001762114537444934,0.000881057268722467,0.029955947136563875,0.018502202643171806,0,0.00881057268722467,0,0.014096916299559472,0.019383259911894272,0.018502202643171806,0.000881057268722467,0,0.022026431718061675,0.2431718061674009,0.001762114537444934,0,0.04669603524229075,0.05110132158590308,0.04757709251101322,0.03700440528634361,0.018502202643171806,0.018502202643171806,0.14625550660792952,0.08193832599118943,0.022026431718061675,0.000881057268722467,0.044933920704845816,0.13303964757709252,0,0.006167400881057269,0.013215859030837005,0.009691629955947136,0.02555066079295154,0,0.015859030837004406,0.014977973568281937,0.1436123348017621,0.06784140969162995,0,0.030837004405286344,0.00881057268722467,0.05110132158590308,0.11277533039647578,0.12951541850220263,0.004405286343612335,0.04757709251101322,0.001762114537444934,39.125,0,36,1,11.73,14,6,21,8,10,34.7,14.73,21,0,39.125,2,123.28500000000001,47,108,268.2850000000001,123.28500000000001,,0.5434906915464606,0,0.5227744249483388,0.02953044805404075,0.2630436845946258,0.2987408917469904,0.15438708879488489,0.38987546550314445,0.19577443661661392,0.23329952500316292,0.513592032188284,0.30949699762969884,0.38987546550314445,0,0.5610221565599143,0.05736682797455384,0.09281517144287559,0.035383972566128505,0.08130785185408251,0.20197849106178273,0.39677698120731214,0.7980215089382172,75
235,"Refugee Manhunt After Family Found in Freezer in Denmark November 01, 2016 Refugee Manhunt After Family Found in Freezer in Denmark (COPENHAGEN) - The bodies of a Syrian woman and her two daughters, aged 7 and 9, have been found in a freezer in a town in Denmark and the woman's husband and refugee father of the children was being sought, Danish police said on Tuesday. The discovery was made on Sunday night in Aabenraa in southern Denmark. The family came to Denmark in summer 2015 and obtained refugee status, police said. A court on Monday pronounced the Syrian father, Hamid Farid Mohammed, ""imprisoned in absentia,"" meaning he should be detained immediately. Police said 33-year-old Mohammed fled Denmark on Friday into Germany and then flew to Turkey.

236,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Davywavy and Hubon Global markets turn red as Toblerone scandal unfolds Markets worldwide have opened down this morning after news of the redesign of Toblerone broke overnight. Concerns about the redesign weighed heavily on global markets causing a drop of almost 1% in early trading, with major indices in London, New York and Germany coming sharply off Monday’s highs. The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve both rushed to reassure markets with statements confirming that interest rate hikes were ‘off the table’ until stability had been reestablished and the bar had the correct number of triangles again. Meanwhile, reports from Europe indicate that several countries have mobilised troops to mass on the Swiss border as international tensions were heightened by the change, with the United States ‘exploring options’ of how to send an aircraft carrier to the landlocked country. “This provocative move by the Swiss is completely at odds with both international treaty and law,” said Germany Armed Forces spokesman Simon Wilhelms. “If we don’t get a sensible number of triangles back pronto we’re going in shooting.” The Swiss National Bank is accused of stockpiling old-style bars before the announcement in order to capitalise upon demand after the fact. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England made an unprecedented intervention in the row, saying that Switzerland’s actions were completely unreasonable now that the pound has reached parity with the chocolate coin.

I am making a statement against Russian aggression in Crimea, and so this is my statement, and if you don’t get it something’s wrong with you and not me. ’” As Brzezinski laughed, Scarborough continued, “I am making a statement against Russian aggression in Crimea, and so this is my statement, and if you don’t get it something’s wrong with you and not me  …     And you know I’m going to make another statement and I’m going to sit down in my pants, and it will then be modern art and I will hang it on your wall. ” Brzezinski added,”That’s what covfefe, if anybody wants to know, that small group knows what covfefe is  —   poopy pants. ” When Brzezinski asked “How long is it going to go,” Scarborough said, “He does a verbal version of that every day, but it’s not just him.

240,"We could talk about cooking as a function of chemistry and physics. Better to talk about elbow grease. Specifically, a physical theory of everyday cooking, The   Continuum. The premise is simple: You start with food, apply a variable equation of time and energy  —   guided perhaps, by a recipe  —   and sooner or later you have a meal. To eat sooner, you will have to expend more of your own energy if you’re willing to wait, then you have the luxury of letting heat serve as the primary energy, transforming the raw ingredients with minimal input from you. According to this hypothesis, every dish can be plotted along a single X axis, measured by Time at one end and Work at the other. If you wanted to go for fancier science, put time on the X axis and a work on the Y and plot recipes in quadrants. (Meanwhile, I’ll make a sandwich.) The two recipes that follow demonstrate how you can use the continuum to increase your kitchen efficiency. The first, a   pork and vegetable braise, requires about 3 hours of time and 5 minutes of work. The second, a fast version of spaghetti and meatballs with red gravy, provides the counterpoint. It’s ready in less than 30 minutes, but you’ll be chopping, stirring and monitoring heat and doneness  —   actively working  —   from start to finish. This is the crux of the hypothesis: To get the biggest return on your investment, whether in time or work, you need to cook toward the extremes of the continuum. Venturing toward the center, where recipes require both time and work in near equal measure, is also fine, especially if you see cooking as an art form or creative outlet that brings you relaxation and pleasure, or in times of celebration or insanity, when you throw yourself into a food project that gives you a sense of accomplishment. But for everyday    fare, you must be more efficient. Otherwise you’ll get frustrated and find your food elsewhere. My job is to lure people into the kitchen, preferably with recipes. In these examples, I’ve rolled the preparation of ingredients into the steps so that you can get an accurate portrayal of the work involved. The modern convention in recipe writing is to incorporate the preparations into the ingredient list. (“1 large onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into   cubes. ”) Many cooks go so far as to suggest you gather and prepare all the ingredients in advance before proceeding with the actual directions. I understand and can execute this approach to a recipe, but I largely ignore it in the privacy of my own kitchen. And I know others do the same, opting instead to merge preparation and cooking, so that executing the various tasks ebb and flow with the natural rhythms of the process. At home, instead of first getting everything in its place  —   known as mise en place, a protocol that makes perfect sense for restaurant chefs  —   you chop the onions while the pan heats, mince the garlic while the onions sizzle and break down the squash in the time it takes the aromatics to soften. Presto. That one bit of multitasking probably saved you 7 minutes. And your work made the most efficient use of time. The spaghetti and meatballs recipe demonstrates   cooking. Throw yourself immediately into the directions and you’ll be sitting at the table twirling pasta in less than a  . You’ll be busy, but not frantic, the whole time, and rewarded with the satisfaction that you made every second count. On the other side of the time axis, there’s braised pork with cabbage and sauerkraut, an easy path to a kind of choucroute garnie. Spend a few minutes making broad strokes with a sharp knife and layer the ingredients in a deep roasting pan. Then walk away for more than 2 hours. Pass through the kitchen again to uncover the pan and turn the oven up, then go back to your business. You’ve just spent a productive 3 or so hours cooking and doing something else. Talk about efficient. With only a little forethought, you can steer many recipes toward the extremes of the   Continuum. Start by transferring the work hidden in the ingredient list  —   the chopping of vegetables and so forth  —   into the steps of the recipe. This is relatively easy: Scan the directions for chunks of time when no other work is happening. Like “Cook, stirring occasionally until brown all over, 3 to 5 minutes. ” Then use that time to prepare for what comes next. Another strategy is to let time do the work, as in the choucroute. This is what makes slow cookers so popular. Leave food in big chunks, don’t   before braising or stewing, marinate vegetables instead of cooking them and the one tip I give all the time: Prepare big batches of key components like beans, whole grains or plainly cooked produce and meat. Once you start to wean yourself from the recipe, or at least take better control of it, you’ll be a better cook.",0,856,19.454545454545453,44,0.2897196261682243,0,0,0,0,92.93514357171064,54.07788161993769,70.46148888172736,56.67028037383178,0.8364485981308412,0.030373831775700934,0.0630841121495327,0.035046728971962614,0.026869158878504672,0.0035046728971962616,0.1483644859813084,0.0011682242990654205,0.0011682242990654205,0.014018691588785047,0.10514018691588785,0,0.04906542056074766,0.04906542056074766,0.0011682242990654205,0.016355140186915886,0.015186915887850467,0.0911214953271028,0.004672897196261682,0.06074766355140187,0.035046728971962614,0.0852803738317757,0,0,0.036214953271028034,0.009345794392523364,0.052570093457943924,0,0,0.002336448598130841,0,0,0.02219626168224299,0.007009345794392523,0,0,0.48364485981308414,0.002336448598130841,0,0.007009345794392523,0.009345794392523364,0.036214953271028034,0,0.0455607476635514,0.008177570093457943,0.008177570093457943,0.01985981308411215,0,0.004672897196261682,0.029205607476635514,0.0035046728971962616,0.004672897196261682,0,0,0.02453271028037383,0.21728971962616822,0.009345794392523364,0.002336448598130841,0.014018691588785047,0.052570093457943924,0.06074766355140187,0.053738317757009345,0.02102803738317757,0.009345794392523364,0.1542056074766355,0.08995327102803738,0.026869158878504672,0,0.004672897196261682,0.17172897196261683,0,0.016355140186915886,0,0,0.005841121495327103,0,0,0,0.05957943925233645,0.07126168224299065,0,0.02570093457943925,0.0011682242990654205,0.07359813084112149,0.12733644859813084,0.10630841121495327,0.0011682242990654205,0.03154205607476635,0.04205607476635514,56.5,0,6,1,15.675,4,4,2,15.3,2,14,13,4.725,0,56.5,0,118.19999999999999,8,14,138.20000000000002,118.19999999999999,,0.6557202473419311,0,0.16823313233447382,0.03261068708575956,0.3457227886356364,0.11881849050177154,0.11881849050177154,0.06316163001913848,0.3402662095497122,0.06316163001913848,0.3206244375399958,0.30470087388041417,0.13739541467134075,0,0.11881849050177154,0,0.12348516506477224,0.008357709987463435,0.01462599247806101,0.14437944003343084,0.8324267646427985,0.8556205599665692,37
241,"Share This Despite being dead for over 7 years, it seems that Michael Jackson’s name has just been dragged back into the spotlight once again. Unfortunately for his family, it looks like bad news for the star’s estate as a woman leaked the $900,000 sex secret he had kept quiet for a whopping 30 years – and she has proof. Most people are aware of Jackson’s depraved past involving children – specifically, little boys. However, the most recent person to come forward is actually a woman, who states that the deceased star had molested and sexually assaulted her about 3 decades prior. According to LA Times , “The alleged abuse started in 1986 and occurred in such iconic locations as Neverland Ranch, the set of ‘Moonwalker,’ Jackson’s Encino mansion, and in the back of the singer’s limousine, according to papers filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.” Unfortunately for the family and Jackson’s estate, her word isn’t all the accuser was armed with . Stock image of Michael Jackson’s “Neverland” ranch Among the court filings are scanned copies of checks purportedly paid to her from Jackson or his entertainment companies, which she says were issued to pay her off in exchange for her silence. In all, the checks totaled a whopping $900,000 – a damning number to say the least. Furthermore, the largest sum, a check for $600,000, was dated in late 1993, which just so happens to be three months after Jackson found himself in yet another lawsuit, that time with a 13-year-old boy saying he had been molested by the King of Pop. Of course, the payment comes at a time where Jackson would have wanted to ensure that all of his other skeletons remained perfectly quiet in his closet. Oddly enough, this is the only time a female victim has come forward to allege a Jackson sexual assault. In addition to that, the woman’s lawyer, Vince Finaldi, said the case offers the first evidence that Jackson and his production company — not an insurance carrier — made direct payments to an alleged abuse victim. Michael Jackson (Source: LA Times ) The abuse allegedly lasted for over 3 years, beginning when the girl was merely 12 years old and ending just after her 15 th birthday. LA Times adds: The woman alleges that for about three years, Jackson fondled her, forced her to orally copulate him, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her, which caused her to bleed, the lawsuit states. Jackson also supplied her with gifts and letters, and two of the notes were attached to the lawsuit. One of the letters ends, “I’m crazy about you. … All my love, Michael.” Of course, the Jackson family lawyer is saying that the entire ordeal is a made-up claim meant to do nothing more than leech off of the star’s estate. As the woman – being a sex assault victim – and her identity are being kept quiet for the time being, it’s hard to say whether she’s looking for a payout or something more. Although this man is dead and buried, and under most circumstances should be left to rest in peace, no sex assault victim should ever go without justice. Although money is a good way to buy silence, it certainly does not equate to anything near justice. In fact, it represents the exact opposite as it proves that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything – even sexually abusing a child. This woman deserves her day in court, and it certainly doesn’t look like the Jackson family is going to like the end result.",1,610,27.727272727272727,22,0.3016393442622951,0,0,0,0,90.26042948438058,8.13789275956284,73.87814207650274,8.270235655737704,0.8098360655737705,0.003278688524590164,0.03770491803278689,0.03442622950819672,0.047540983606557376,0.009836065573770493,0.1737704918032787,0.014754098360655738,0,0.02459016393442623,0.08688524590163935,0,0.07049180327868852,0.01639344262295082,0.003278688524590164,0.011475409836065573,0.02459016393442623,0.08852459016393442,0.003278688524590164,0.07049180327868852,0.027868852459016394,0.04590163934426229,0.004918032786885246,0.006557377049180328,0.02622950819672131,0.00819672131147541,0.060655737704918035,0,0.006557377049180328,0.001639344262295082,0.03934426229508197,0,0.001639344262295082,0.03770491803278689,0,0,0.46229508196721314,0.001639344262295082,0.018032786885245903,0.00819672131147541,0.003278688524590164,0.047540983606557376,0.001639344262295082,0,0.011475409836065573,0.011475409836065573,0.00819672131147541,0.021311475409836064,0.01639344262295082,0.013114754098360656,0.011475409836065573,0.03114754098360656,0,0,0.029508196721311476,0.2081967213114754,0.018032786885245903,0.001639344262295082,0.027868852459016394,0.03934426229508197,0.05245901639344262,0.04918032786885246,0.01639344262295082,0.040983606557377046,0.14426229508196722,0.09672131147540984,0.021311475409836064,0,0.011475409836065573,0.13442622950819672,0,0.006557377049180328,0.001639344262295082,0,0.00819672131147541,0,0.011475409836065573,0.040983606557377046,0.10163934426229508,0.060655737704918035,0.001639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0,0.07049180327868852,0.10655737704918032,0.11475409836065574,0,0.02622950819672131,0.004918032786885246,16,0,72,0,17,8,5,38,1,42,10,11,13,0,16,0,55,15,130,198,55,,0.43271104029591567,0,0.7743919179247432,0,0.44764906210497696,0.2760888715617666,0.19248405980003652,0.6443279635365387,0.045503819962193694,0.6669188576563992,0.3228287342177362,0.3440061021863114,0.3826210351447948,0,0.3826210351447948,0,0.0728476821192053,0.019867549668874173,0.17218543046357615,0.26225165562913905,-0.8348881085912397,0.737748344370861,53
242,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The House vote on the health care bill was delayed amid a swirl of Republican deal making and White House wrangling, but the Senate passed a measure to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections. Exactly when the health care vote will occur is not yet clear. The current version of the compromise bill strips away minimum requirements for coverage, like maternity care, hospitalization and prescriptions. Here are the changes made to the bill so far. And here is an easy way to see how it differs from Obamacare. The Daily podcast looks at why the Republicans are so divided. _____ 2. In the other major fight on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats signaled a willingness to filibuster Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch. The judge, who emerged largely unscathed from 20 hours of Senate questioning over two days, appeared to be short of the eight Democratic votes he’ll need to proceed to a final confirmation vote. If the Democrats dig in, the Republican majority could change the rules to allow a simple majority vote to move the confirmation forward. _____ 3. The Islamic State claimed the deadly attack outside the British Parliament. The suspect, who was shot and killed, was identified as a      man of Pakistani descent who had a long criminal history but no terrorism convictions. The four people he killed and dozens he injured came from around the world, and included a Utah man who’d been traveling with his wife. London fell back on its famed resolve. “It takes a lot to shake a Londoner,” one woman said. “The Blitz spirit lives on. ” _____ 4. A suspect in the some of the scores of bomb threats against Jewish community centers was arrested: a Jewish teenager in Israel. The authorities said the youth, a dual  . S. citizen, used “advanced camouflage technologies” to mask the origin of his calls. His lawyer said he has a brain tumor. _____ 5. “He was particularly offended by black men who are with white women. His intent was to kill as many black men here in New York in particular. ” That was a prosecutor, explaining the case against this Army veteran, James Harris Jackson, who is facing murder charges in the fatal stabbing of a    New Yorker, Timothy Caughman. A relative of Mr. Caughman wanted people to know that he lived a full life. _____ 6. Good news from California: Using NASA data, we compared this year’s snowpack in the Sierra Nevada with that of 2015, when the state was in the grip of drought. After a very wet winter, the totals have been remarkably big. And bad news from the Arctic, which has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements. The extent of ice cover  —   a record low for the third straight year  —   is another indicator of the effects of global warming. _____ 7. “If my father were alive, I would not be spending the day in the bazaar. ” That’s one of the  nearly 4 million boys and girls in Afghanistan who won’t be at school on Thursday, the first day of the new school year, because of violence, displacement and poverty. Another such child is above. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban captured the strategic district of Sangin in Helmand Province. More British and American Marines died in Sangin than in any of the country’s roughly 400 other districts. _____ 8. When couples divorce, who gets to keep the pets? Courts are shifting from treating them as property. Above, Charlene Lima, a   Rhode Island state representative who has introduced legislation to encourage the legal system to act in the best interests of the animals. Alaska already has such a law. A particularly contentious legal fight in San Diego over Gigi the dog lasted two years, cost $150, 000 and involved a   “bonding study” by an animal behaviorist. _____ 9. John Mayer knows he messed up. As the   finished a   new album this month, he reflected on his 2010 undoing. (In comments to two magazines, he called his penis David Duke, and used a racial epithet, among other highlights.) “What has to happen for a guy to believe that he’s totally   and be that far out of touch?” he said. “My GPS was shattered, just shattered. ” _____ 10. In other navigational fails, Stephen Colbert lamented that he missed a sex scandal involving a rear admiral named Bruce Loveless amid the cacophony of news from Washington. “What has happened to us as a nation?” he grumbled. Indeed, there’s just so much news that keeping up can be overwhelming  —   not to mention going the extra mile to see events from alternative perspectives. So we’re making it easier, with a collection of political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

243,"Emma Morano, the last surviving person hailing from the 1800s, died this weekend. She took our human link to simpler times with her. [The Italian was born in a kingdom but died in a republic. Yet she never lived more than 20 miles from her place of birth. Time makes immigrants of us all if we live long enough.  She entered and exited a world with inhabitants innocent of a Soviet Union, not recognizing Pluto as a planet, or knowing anything called Eastern Airlines. In fact, the Wright Brothers’ first flight, Charles Lindbergh’s crossing of the Atlantic, and Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon all lay in the future in 1899. No radio stations, televisions, computers, or internet marked her earliest days of existence. How long did Mrs. Morano live? Ernest Hemingway, Humphrey Bogart, Al Capone, and Duke Ellington all came into the world in 1899 as well. They all died more than a half century ago. Life expectancy averaged about fifty years upon Morano’s birth. So, by the expectations of the late 19th century, she lived more than two lifetimes. The discovery of penicillin, the creation of vaccines for polio, yellow fever, and tuberculosis, and the invention of CT scans,   and MRIs all helped extend existence over her existence. She married upon the threat of death, and separated upon the reality of bodily harm. She nevertheless remained married to her husband until his death in 1978 —  40 years after the separation —  in part because Italy only legalized divorce in 1970. She said her one true love died in World War I. Morano credited her longevity to diet, which rebelled against modern medical advice while conforming to medical advice given to her about a century ago, in its reliance on raw eggs. “I eat two eggs a day, and that’s it —  and cookies,” she told the AFP last year. “But I do not eat much because I have no teeth. ” The lesson? Pull your teeth if you long for longevity. Or, perhaps go full Rocky Balboa and down a cup of raw yolks everyday. Alas, the best advice instructs us to enter the world with the type of genetics that only comes along once every 117 years.",0,371,15.458333333333334,24,0.2695417789757412,0,0,0,0,94.20489453643093,55.512560646900276,71.43459119496855,40.292506738544475,0.8382749326145552,0.01078167115902965,0.04851752021563342,0.029649595687331536,0.029649595687331536,0.026954177897574125,0.1752021563342318,0.008086253369272238,0.0026954177897574125,0.013477088948787063,0.08086253369272237,0,0.013477088948787063,0.05390835579514825,0.01078167115902965,0.013477088948787063,0.026954177897574125,0.1105121293800539,0,0.07277628032345014,0.03234501347708895,0.07008086253369272,0,0.018867924528301886,0.0431266846361186,0.01078167115902965,0.05660377358490566,0,0.013477088948787063,0,0.04582210242587601,0,0.008086253369272238,0.05121293800539083,0,0,0.431266846361186,0.02425876010781671,0.005390835579514825,0,0.01078167115902965,0.0215633423180593,0.0026954177897574125,0.016172506738544475,0.016172506738544475,0.005390835579514825,0.01078167115902965,0.01078167115902965,0.0026954177897574125,0.0215633423180593,0.013477088948787063,0.01078167115902965,0,0.0026954177897574125,0.0431266846361186,0.20485175202156333,0.01078167115902965,0,0.01078167115902965,0.06199460916442048,0.0431266846361186,0.07547169811320754,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.15363881401617252,0.09703504043126684,0.029649595687331536,0.005390835579514825,0.01078167115902965,0.20485175202156333,0,0.005390835579514825,0.0026954177897574125,0,0.005390835579514825,0,0.0026954177897574125,0.04582210242587601,0.1078167115902965,0.09164420485175202,0,0.018867924528301886,0.0026954177897574125,0.09164420485175202,0.09433962264150944,0.0862533692722372,0.01078167115902965,0.013477088948787063,0.005390835579514825,7,0,51.125,0,0,0,0,17.875,1.83,48.125,3,4,6,3,7,0,21.83,0,65.125,85.955,21.83,,0.24213994455091997,0,0.7000173671379373,0,0,0,0,0.4493023300006232,0.07708865291484307,0.6871671921651294,0.12043886815418245,0.15438708879488486,0.2149851662190087,0.12043886815418245,0.6524266862638008,0,0.05065494077107818,0,0.15111786613451522,0.19945237901869106,-0.7364731838720566,0.8005476209813089,26

Nothing says “love wins” like forcing the police to   you. https:  .   —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) January 20, 2017, Pepper seasoning was added to this assortment of mixed nuts outside the “DeploraBall” inaugural event. Politico quoted NBC News reports about the demonstrators burning a Trump hat and lugging around an inflatable elephant festooned with a “RACISM” banner  —   because Republicans are racists, get it? See? SEE?  —   and then added their own impressions of the madness:  Protesters outside the building chanted “Nazi scum” at DeploraBall attendees as they entered the building and a DeploraBall Twitter account posted videos of the group outside chanting “F —   Trump. ” Along with the video, the DeploraBall account’s post read, “SHOUTING WONT CHANGE TOMORROWS OUTCOME  …     CANT WAIT TO SAY PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump. ” The demonstrators also brought with them a projector, used to project two messages onto nearby buildings: “Impeach the predatory president” and “bragging about grabbing a woman’s genitals. ” Here’s some video of the tear gas flowing: BREAKING: DC police mace, teargas   protests outside National Press club.

When you come for our communities, when you come for us, and when you try to violate our rights, we will resist,” a Loserpalooza spokeswoman told Jenkins. The rest of us are really concerned about   thugs blocking streets and setting things on fire. Michael Moore melts down: Were are the clowns? Quick, send in the clowns!

Moore also attended a protest rally in New York City on Thursday night, along with such Hollywood intellectual giants as Alec Baldwin and Mark Ruffalo, where he declared President Trump would “not last four years” and called for “a hundred days of protest. ” His actor buddies should clue him in to the actual attention span of his followers.

The whole “occupy” strategy of the Left, from Occupy Wall Street through Black Lives Matter, is about forcing people to listen by illegally seizing property and blocking off roads. And then they wonder why so many people voted for Donald Trump when he said he’d get America moving again. Peaceful, tolerant protesters throw eggs, assault Trump supporters: Gateway Pundit reported on Trump supporters getting pelted with eggs, with one woman talking about how she was struck in the head several times: James Allsup reported he was ambushed by thugs in ski masks and beaten bloody. “I was wearing my ‘Make America Great Again’ hat, and a white male came up behind me and swung at me with a flagpole  —   I kind of blacked out for a minute. Before I knew it, my head was gushing blood  —   there’s blood on my Trump hat,” he told Fox News. “I’m all for disagreeing, I debate people all the time and I want to engage in these discussions, but they’re throwing bottles. I would be livid if people who supported Trump were doing this to Hillary supporters,” Allsup added. He posted photos of the aftermath on Twitter: Here are the graphic images of the assault aftermath before being treated by EMS and taken to the hospital. #Deploraballpic. twitter.   —   James Allsup (@realJamesAllsup) January 20, 2017, His Twitter feed quickly filled with caring, compassionate liberals who accused him of faking the blood, and even of faking his hospital report, but there is video of the entire assault, and you can see the thug waving his flagpole around:  That’s what you get for thinking you can walk around wearing whatever you want and expressing your opinions in a city under occupation by the Army of Tolerance, buddy. Anarchists unite! Sky News caught a menacing   crew marching around with anarchist flags and threatening slogans. Nothing brings people together like a little ISIS cosplay!

C. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio “caused traffic mayhem for his own political gains,” as the New York Post put it, by heading up a “massive   protest in Columbus Circle. ” The streets were lined with obstacles such as sand trucks and, eventually, Michael Moore. “It’s terrible, I just want to go home,” and “It’s irresponsible of the mayor,” and “I’m appalled at what’s happening here and I am angry at de Blasio” were among the comments from   New Yorkers collected by the Post. The rally ended up looking like this: It looks like the Left is dissolving into one big Godwin’s Law violation. They’re just so   that they get to pretend they’re brave heroes battling an evil dictator! These are the same people that tried, with considerable success, to shut down bakeries and pizzerias over ideological disagreements when they were in power. At this very moment, as seen above, they’re using violence to shut down the free speech of others. They’re displacing a huge amount of guilt for their own sins against democracy onto Trump’s shoulders. He should send them a bill for therapeutic services rendered.

245,"Share on Facebook Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past couple-hundred years, you’ve heard at least one person complain that black people need to go “back to Africa.” Even the President of the United States, unfortunately, is not immune to this treatment. For years, Barack Obama has weathered a barrage of race-based hatred, with people who would become Trump’s Basket of Deplorables calling him “monkey” and “ape” and “n*gger”— and, yes, complaining that President Obama (who was born in Hawaii) needs to go “back to Africa.” In this case, Deplorable Fox News contributor Sean Hannity told the President to get on a plane to Kenya after the election and never return. “I have an offer for the President. I will charter a plane for you and your family,” Hannity said on his radio show. “I will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I’ll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I’ll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there.” “I will charter Donald Trump’s plane if he’ll let me,” Hannity added, noting that there is “one stipulation”—“You can’t come back!” Naturally, this message of “go back to Africa and stay there” resonated with conservatives, with many chiming in to offer their own suggestions on right-wing lie-factory Western Journalism’s comment section . Some suggested he be flown to Guantanamo Bay to be tortured for 50 years. Others suggested outright assassination. One man even made a creepy remark about stalking Malia Obama in the bathroom: All of these people will be voting for Mr. Deplorable on November 28. Make sure you’re out there on November 8, when it’s actually Election Day.

246,"2016 elections by Patrick Bond Donald Trump is mostly bad news for Africa, including reduced U.S. aid and possibly more support for “imperial African adventurism"" – unless, of course, Africa uses Trump’s lemons to make lemonade. His isolationism “could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.” On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . “ Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.” The most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. Under Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama’s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. By good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries – the US especially – which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. “Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.” Trump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. And African elites who have – with a few exceptions – climbed over each other to please Washington, won’t find themselves welcome in the White House. Hopefully the contagion of Trump’s racism – which will make life for Africans much harder – will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US – women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. What are the likely economic consequences? Consistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. That isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. Trump’s hatred of what he terms the “globalists” is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It’s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. The “neoliberal” group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. We can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. What US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? To be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to “rebuild US military power,” which might include strengthening the Pentagon’s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. Economically, it is worth noting Trump’s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump’s bully-boy mentality. What does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? The US’s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington’s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). In relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump’s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans – amongst others – so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. The period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. And the second is that three of the BRICS’ nationalistic leaders – Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil – can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump’s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. Regardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it’s time for a ‘multilateralism-from-below’ in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we’ve seen in living memory.

247,"Email The president has to be kicking himself over this one. As his term in office comes to a close, it seems as if Barack Obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity. Earlier today, the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the White House this whole time, after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by Reagan National Airport. Sorry, Mr. President, but it’s true. You really blew your chance on this one. Having booked an extended stay at the airport Hilton upon his inauguration back in 2009, Barack and his family have resided in an atrium-view room with two double beds and complimentary wi-fi for the past eight years. But earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the White House, you could tell that Obama hadn’t realized the choice was his to make until that very moment. Yes, Obama’s accomplished a lot over the years, but he’s got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the Affordable Care Act if he hadn’t wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the Oval Office on the D.C. Metro. There’s no doubt the countless Hilton Rewards Points Obama has accrued is a nice perk, but that doesn’t soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms. This is something Obama is going to regret for a long time to come. “Nobody ever explicitly told me that I could live there until now,” said a clearly disappointed Obama, as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels. “While Sasha and Malia love being on the same floor as the pool here, I now wish we had stayed at the lavish, 20,000-square-foot private residence in the White House for the past eight years.

248,"WITWATERSRAND BASIN, South Africa  —   A mile down in an unused mine tunnel, scientists guided by helmet lamps trudged through darkness and the muck of a flooded, uneven floor. In the subterranean world of the Beatrix gold mine, they shed their backpacks, taking out tools and meticulously prepared test tubes to collect samples. Leaning a ladder against the hard rock wall, Tullis C. Onstott, a geosciences professor at Princeton, climbed to open an old valve about a dozen feet up. Out flowed water   of microbes, organisms flourishing not from the warmth of the sun, but by heat generated from the interior of the planet below. These tiny    —   bacteria and other microbes and even little worms  —   exist in places nearly impossible to reach, living in eternal darkness, in hard rock. Scientists like Dr. Onstott have been on the hunt for life in the underworld, not just in South Africa but in mines in South Dakota and at the bottom of oceans. What they learn could provide insights into where life could exist elsewhere in the solar system, including Mars. Microbial Martians might well look like what lives in the rocks here at a deep underground mine. The same conditions almost certainly exist on Mars. Drill a hole there, drop these organisms in, and they might happily multiply, fueled by chemical reactions in the rocks and drips of water. “As long as you can get below the ice, no problems,” Dr. Onstott said. “They just need a little bit of water. ” Mars has long been a focus of space exploration and science fiction dreams. NASA has sent more robotic probes there than any other planet. But now there is renewed interest in sending people as well. NASA has been enthusiastically promoting its “Journey to Mars” goal to send astronauts there in the 2030s. Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX, is promising that he will be able to get there a decade sooner and set up colonies. Astronauts on Mars would be able to greatly accelerate the quest for answers to the most intriguing questions about the red planet. Was there ever life on Mars? Could there be life there today? It was not that long ago that scientists had written off Mars as lifeless. Forty years ago, NASA spent nearly $1 billion on its Viking mission, which revealed a cold, dry world seemingly devoid of organic molecules that are the building blocks of life. But more recent missions have discovered compelling evidence that Mars was not always such an uninviting place. In its youth, more than three billion years ago, the planet was warmer and wetter, blanketed with a thick atmosphere  —   possibly almost Earthlike. A fanciful but plausible notion is that life did originate on Mars, then traveled to Earth via meteorites, and we are all descendants of Martians. Eventually, Mars did turn cold and dry. Radiation broke apart the water molecules, and the lighter hydrogen atoms escaped to space. The atmosphere thinned to wisps. But if life did arise on Mars, might it have migrated to the underworld and persisted? For a couple of decades, Dr. Onstott has been talking his way into South African gold mines, regaling the mine managers with the wonder of deep Earth life to overcome their wariness. In many ways, the mines provide easy access to the depths  —   a ride in a cagelike elevator, jammed against miners starting their shift, descending quickly as lights from the different levels zip past. Think of it as traveling through a   skyscraper, going down. Dr. Onstott and his colleagues had made repeated pilgrimages to this particular tunnel in this particular mine, Beatrix, 160 miles southwest of Johannesburg. When miners carve out new tunnels, they poke holes through the rock to see what surprises might lie ahead. Sometimes the borehole taps into a section of fractured rock with water coursing through. Then the fracture is drained and plugged. But this particular tunnel at Beatrix never entered production, so the borehole valve remains, allowing the scientists to return to draw samples from the same place. At this level, almost a mile underground, the elevator gates open to a   concrete cavern with the unremarkable plainness of a parking garage. A minirailway system transports miners and ore back and forth. The side tunnel, though, is pitch black save for the helmet lamps, and the trek to the valve is a slosh through muck and over tangles of mangled electrical cabling. Scientists led by Dr. Onstott made their most recent trip to South Africa in June last year. Over a couple of hours, they took their fill of the water and set up an apparatus that remains attached to the valve, trapping microbes, which were retrieved later in the summer. Since then, they have been analyzing the samples to understand this assemblage of life. The existence of what biologists now call the Earth’s deep biosphere was unknown to almost all biologists at the time of the Viking mission. Life lived at the surface, in the soil or in the oceans. At the bottom of the food chain, the   primary producers, were plants and microbes that used photosynthesis and sunlight to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Other creatures ate the plants and microbes, and then larger creatures ate the smaller ones. In someplace that was always dark, it seemed obvious there could be no primary producers and therefore no life at all. Some scientists noticed close to a century ago this might not always be true. Edson S. Bastin, a geologist at the University of Chicago, wondered why some petroleum was “sour”  —   with high levels of sulfur that not only corroded pipes but also generated more pollution when burned. Bastin realized bacteria could do that, in particular a type of bacteria that does not need oxygen and eats sulfur compounds known as sulfates and excretes hydrogen sulfide  —   the rotten egg smell  —   and bicarbonate, the unwanted chemicals in sour crude oil. He and a colleague, Frank E. Greer, successfully cultured such bacteria from groundwater from an oil field, and Bastin speculated these could be descendants of bacteria that had been trapped in ocean sediments more than 250 million years ago. Other scientists contended that this must be a mistake, merely surface microbes on the drill that had contaminated the sample. In the late 1980s, the Department of Energy started a drilling project, carefully pulling up pristine cores from a couple hundred yards down. Bacteria, fungi and other microbes abounded in the cores. That spurred additional research and discoveries, including bacteria that lived in the heat of underground oil deposits and finally, a microbe that degraded oil as Bastin had predicted. Today, the deep biosphere is thought to account for 10 to 20 percent of mass of all life on Earth. Life, biologists also discovered, perseveres in other environments once thought sterile  —   highly acidic water, highly alkaline water, highly salty water, boiling water around volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean. “The truth is it’s virtually everywhere we look,” Penny Boston, the director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, said in July at a panel celebrating the 40th anniversary of Viking’s landing on Mars. Results from an earlier trip to Beatrix befuddled Dr. Onstott. He had expected the mine microbes to be feeding off organic matter dissolved in the water. In this picture, the ecosystem would be largely devoid of primary producers and instead subsist on leftovers, the detritus of long dead organisms washed down from above or deposited with the sediment 2. 9 billion years ago. “The only problem was that we didn’t have any indication they were eating the organic matter in the fracture water,” Dr. Onstott said. They figured out that the carbon molecules in the microbes came from methane, a plausible answer. Microbes known as methanogens consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide and produce methane other microbes known as methanotrophs eat methane. But the Beatrix water contained little of either. “It didn’t make any sense at all,” Dr. Onstott said. “It made zero sense to us. ” Maggie Lau, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Onstott’s laboratory, started examining the genetic snippets for clues of how the Beatrix community of microbes worked. With the newest data, it turned out there was a wider community of primary producer microbes, eating nitrogen and sulfur compounds. In essence, the waste of one microbe helped feed its neighbor, and only a little bit of methane, an   molecule, was enough to power the entire community. “Now, for the first time, we’re getting a true description of the ecosystem,” Dr. Onstott said. “We think it’s a fairly common phenomenon. ” After working at Beatrix, the scientists went north, to the Limpopo region close to South Africa’s border with Zimbabwe. There, they collected water from hot springs, whose source of water from far below should carry up underground microbes. One sampling site was in the middle of a small village where houses do not have plumbing and the spring, the hottest in South Africa, is a pond that serves as a communal spot for cleaning laundry. Another is a pool at a resort, once catering to the country’s white minority. Surprisingly, the spring waters contained almost no microbes  —   barely enough DNA to analyze. But water from two locations contained considerable amounts of methane, an encouraging sign. The methane is also a possible connection to Mars. A dozen years ago, three teams of scientists, one using data from the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter, the other two using observations from Earth, made the controversial claim of methane floating in the Martian atmosphere. That was a surprise, because sunlight and chemical reactions destroy methane any methane there would have had to have been released recently. There are two ways to produce methane. One is a geological process that requires heat and liquid water. The other is methanogens. Perplexingly, the readings of methane later vanished. As NASA’s Curiosity rover drove across Gale Crater a couple of years ago, it too detected a burp of methane that lasted a couple of months. But it has not detected any burps since. Perhaps an underground population of methanogens and methanotrophs is creating, then destroying methane quickly, accounting for its sudden appearance and disappearance from the atmosphere. If Beatrix is a guide, the methane could be providing the energy for many other microbes. Conventional wisdom is that Martian life, if it exists, would be limited to microbes. But that too is a guess. In the South African mine, the researchers also discovered a species of tiny worms eating the bacteria. “It’s like Moby Dick in Lake Ontario,” Dr. Onstott said. “It was a big surprise to find something that big in a tiny fracture of a rock. The fact it would be down there in such a confined space slithering around is pretty amazing. ” The odds of Mars life, past or present, are just conjecture. Even if life did arise on Mars four billion years ago and later migrated underground, could it have survived for four billion years? There are reasons to be skeptical. When low on water and energy, microbes can slow their metabolism or enter a state of suspended animation, able to revive when conditions improve. But many biologists doubt that such a tenuous hold on life could extend for a few billion years. Mars also lacks Earth’s plate tectonics, a continual recycling of the outer crust of the planets that fractures rocks and exposes new minerals for microbes to eat. If life is deep underground, robotic spacecraft would not find them easily. NASA’s InSight spacecraft, scheduled to launch in 2018, will carry an instrument that can burrow 16 feet into the ground, but it is essentially just a thermometer to measure the flow of heat to the surface. NASA’s next rover, launching in 2020, is largely a clone of Curiosity with different experiments. It will drill rock samples to be returned to Earth by a later mission, but those samples will be from rocks at the surface. All this new interest in possible life on Mars is a sort of vindication for Gilbert V. Levin, one of the scientists who worked on Viking. Dr. Levin is sure he discovered life on Mars 40 years ago, and everyone else has been drawing the wrong conclusions from the Viking data. If he is right, then perhaps rediscovering life on Mars may require just scratching the surface. The two Vikings carried what was known as the labeled release experiment, developed by Dr. Levin and another investigator, Patricia A. Straat. Essentially, radioactive food made with unstable   was added to samples of Martian soil. The idea was that if microbes digested the food, the   would be released in a stream of radioactive carbon dioxide and other gases rising out of the soil. That is exactly what happened. Then other samples were heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit to sterilize them. If microbes were generating the radioactive gases, then there should be no gas rising from the sterilized soil. That, too, is what happened. “The response on Mars is well within the responses from terrestrial soils,” Dr. Levin said, “most closely the Arctic and Alaska. ” But in the absence of organic molecules, other Viking scientists discounted the possibility of life. It was like claiming the existence of a city in a place lacking wood, steel, bricks or any other building materials. Dr. Levin has proposed, again and again, sending another labeled release experiment to Mars, to no avail. NASA’s 2020 rover will be able to catalog a wide variety of organic molecules, but carries nothing to look for life directly. Dr. Levin may finally get his wish with ExoMars, a European rover scheduled to launch in 2020. He is working with one of the teams building one of ExoMars’s instruments to see if it could be modified to incorporate the labeled release apparatus. There is a bit of a race against time. Dr. Levin, the last surviving member of the Viking biology team, is 92. “All I have to do is last that long,” he said.",0,2353,17.825757575757574,132,0.3310667233319167,0,0,0,0,95.14484004476708,38.52576089443919,46.770080747981304,38.62465265291445,0.7590310242243944,0.011474713132171696,0.042923926901827454,0.035699107522311944,0.019549511262218443,0.008499787505312367,0.15384615384615385,0.0008499787505312367,0.00042498937526561835,0.00764980875478113,0.09732256693582661,0,0.06672333191670209,0.039524011899702505,0.0025499362515937103,0.017849553761155972,0.011049723756906077,0.10752231194220145,0,0.06544836379090523,0.025499362515937103,0.049723756906077346,0,0.00042498937526561835,0.029749256268593285,0.016999575010624733,0.04929876753081173,0,0,0.006374840628984276,0,0,0.012324691882702932,0.04504887377815554,0.0012749681257968552,0.0012749681257968552,0.45261368465788354,0.01997450063748406,0.004674883127921802,0.0021249468763280916,0.003399915002124947,0.04334891627709307,0.0016999575010624734,0.014874628134296642,0.018699532511687208,0.008074798130046749,0.009774755631109222,0.004249893752656183,0.003399915002124947,0.016999575010624733,0.008499787505312367,0.005949851253718657,0,0.0012749681257968552,0.020399490012749683,0.20229494262643433,0.004674883127921802,0,0.02337441563960901,0.061623459413514665,0.039524011899702505,0.01827454313642159,0.01317467063323417,0.02379940501487463,0.1478963025924352,0.061623459413514665,0.022949426264343393,0.0016999575010624734,0.012749681257968552,0.1619209519762006,0.00042498937526561835,0.005099872503187421,0.003824904377390565,0.0008499787505312367,0.007224819379515512,0,0.00042498937526561835,0.004249893752656183,0.03102422439439014,0.09987250318742032,0.00042498937526561835,0.02634934126646834,0.00764980875478113,0.046323841903952404,0.1109222269443264,0.1109222269443264,0.0025499362515937103,0.025499362515937103,0.00042498937526561835,40,0,46,0,10.75,68.4,16.6,60.75,33.879999999999995,52,19,28,20,0,40,53,129.63,138,167.15,423.78000000000003,129.63,,0.43772808902540444,0,0.47237174518012165,0,0.17302171310741524,0.5710424841443081,0.24418612577327592,0.541777365348919,0.39736840631416814,0.5029941193383307,0.2699594892402588,0.35272955216082674,0.2801868778094689,0,0.3793144131220165,0.5077555817928558,0.04853638262979354,0.05167029856446431,0.06258471308007399,0.15867274728730932,-0.5080444598673666,0.8413272527126907,106
249,"President Obama canceled a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines scheduled for Tuesday in Laos, after the Philippine president directed an expletive at Mr. Obama on Monday. On Tuesday, Mr. Duterte released a statement saying he regretted that his curse “came across as a personal attack on the U. S. president. ” He blamed his words on “certain press questions that elicited concern and distress. ” Mr. Duterte had warned Mr. Obama not to ask him about extrajudicial killings related to his crackdown on drug dealers, a campaign pledge that helped sweep him to victory in the country’s presidential election in May. “I am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,” Mr. Duterte told reporters before he left his country for Laos, where he and Mr. Obama will attend the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody,” he said in remarks published by The Associated Press. Apparently addressing Mr. Obama, he added: “You must be respectful. Do not just throw questions. ” Then, using a curse in Tagalog that can be translated as “son of a bitch,” he added, “I will swear at you in that forum. ” Mr. Obama, who was in China for a Group of 20 meeting, departed on Monday for Laos, becoming the first American president to visit the nation. He is also scheduled to take part in the East Asia Summit and speak at a forum with young people. Mr. Obama had planned to meet Mr. Duterte in Laos, but the White House said early Tuesday that the meeting had been canceled. “Clearly, he’s a colorful guy,” Mr. Obama said Monday. “I always want to make sure if I’m having a meeting that it’s productive. ” Mr. Duterte acknowledged Tuesday that the meeting had been canceled and seemed to take a softer tone: “We look forward to ironing out differences arising out of national priorities and perceptions, and working in mutually responsible ways for both countries. ” Last month, the Philippines’ top police official, Chief Ronald dela Rosa, told a Senate hearing that killings by the police and vigilantes in the country’s war on drugs had soared to nearly 1, 800 in the seven weeks since Mr. Duterte, a former mayor of Davao, was sworn into office. Mr. Duterte’s public image has been characterized by bouts of coarse language. He has lashed out at his critics, threatening to withdraw from the United Nations after human rights experts called for a halt to the killings. He joked about the rape of an Australian missionary during the presidential campaign, and he cursed Pope Francis and his entourage for causing huge traffic jams in Manila during the pope’s visit to the Philippines in 2015.",0,471,22.428571428571427,21,0.32908704883227174,0,0,0,0,96.02491309115513,19.886883698985606,87.85159668963126,4.371970516364217,0.821656050955414,0.010615711252653927,0.03184713375796178,0.016985138004246284,0.040339702760084924,0.010615711252653927,0.19532908704883228,0.01910828025477707,0.004246284501061571,0.016985138004246284,0.09129511677282377,0,0.06581740976645435,0.006369426751592357,0,0.012738853503184714,0.010615711252653927,0.07006369426751592,0.004246284501061571,0.05732484076433121,0.01910828025477707,0.036093418259023353,0,0.008492569002123142,0.016985138004246284,0.008492569002123142,0.11889596602972399,0,0.0021231422505307855,0.006369426751592357,0,0,0.008492569002123142,0.050955414012738856,0.0021231422505307855,0.0021231422505307855,0.4564755838641189,0.004246284501061571,0.014861995753715499,0.004246284501061571,0.010615711252653927,0.027600849256900213,0.004246284501061571,0,0.016985138004246284,0.004246284501061571,0.0021231422505307855,0.07643312101910828,0,0.014861995753715499,0.010615711252653927,0.029723991507430998,0.0021231422505307855,0,0.012738853503184714,0.17834394904458598,0,0,0.03184713375796178,0.07430997876857749,0.07643312101910828,0.06369426751592357,0.008492569002123142,0.08492569002123142,0.16560509554140126,0.09129511677282377,0.012738853503184714,0,0.04246284501061571,0.16560509554140126,0.006369426751592357,0.010615711252653927,0.010615711252653927,0.0021231422505307855,0.008492569002123142,0,0.0021231422505307855,0.04246284501061571,0.1464968152866242,0.09978768577494693,0.0021231422505307855,0.016985138004246284,0,0.055201698513800426,0.11252653927813164,0.11677282377919321,0.004246284501061571,0.055201698513800426,0.006369426751592357,6,3,69.35,3,8,0,5.6,2,2,32,7,7,3,0,6,0,36,5.6,93.35,134.95,36,,0.22646721143623746,0.12769271191181897,0.7718943502844403,0.12769271191181897,0.28076183217795947,0,0.214609532160219,0.0889129881342269,0.0889129881342269,0.6095946208254731,0.25460191569658863,0.25460191569658863,0.12769271191181897,0,0.40586884574494986,0,0.06294256490952006,0.009791065652592008,0.16321356761954714,0.23594719818165918,-0.7982864833258073,0.7640528018183408,34
250,"Gov. Chris Christie, who has long resisted raising any taxes, has battled with Democratic leaders since early summer over raising New Jersey’s gas tax, reaching an impasse that brought hundreds of highway and transit projects to a standstill that lasted months. But on Friday, a day after a fatal train crash in Hoboken focused attention on the troubled conditions of the   railroad, Mr. Christie, a Republican, finally gave way by accepting the first tax increase during his seven years in office. He said he had agreed to raise the gas tax by 23 cents a gallon to replenish the depleted Transportation Trust Fund, which the state uses to pay for improvements to rails, roads and bridges. Mr. Christie, who has just over one year left in his second term, has prided himself on his refusal to raise taxes and promoted his record during his campaign to be the Republican presidential candidate. But he said he made an exception for the gas tax because the need to maintain the state’s transportation infrastructure was so critical. “While I’m not authorizing any other tax increase during my time as governor,” he said, “I’m authorizing this one because of the importance of the Transportation Trust Fund, the tax fairness that we’ve accomplished together and the compromise we’ve reached, and because we need to responsibly finance this type of activity. ” Mr. Christie made the announcement at the State House in Trenton, flanked by the State Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, and the speaker of the State Assembly, Vincent Prieto, both Democrats. The three men each described the agreement as a   compromise. “Sorry it took so long,” Senator Sweeney said. “But we all have strong personalities, and sometimes it just takes time to get together. ” The increase could take effect as soon as next week. The Legislature has scheduled a special session for Wednesday to vote on the matter. In exchange for Mr. Christie’s acceptance of the higher gas tax, the Democrats agreed to lower the state’s sales tax by less than half a penny and to phase out the estate tax by 2018. Mr. Christie said the sales tax rate would decrease next year to 6. 875 percent, from 7 percent. In 2018, he said, it will drop again, to 6. 625 percent. He said the gas tax would pay for an   $32 billion reauthorization of the Transportation Trust Fund, adding that “$32 billion will be invested in infrastructure and improvements and modernizations in the state of New Jersey over the next eight years. ” Mr. Prieto said that the agreement “couldn’t come soon enough,” and that replenishing the transportation fund was “so important because it’s a public safety issue. ” Mr. Christie had argued for the reduction of other taxes to balance the tax burden of New Jersey residents. He had called for a 1 cent decrease in the sales tax rate, but settled for a package of cuts that would include the smaller decrease. Along with the   drop in the sales tax, the Democrats also accepted a phaseout of the state’s estate tax, an increase in the   tax credit for the working poor and a tax break for veterans. The     increase in what the state collects on fuel sales  —   currently the   rate of all the states  —   would be the first in New Jersey in nearly three decades. It was last raised in 1988, and now only Alaska’s is lower. With the proposed increase, to 37. 5 cents, New Jersey’s gas tax would be considerably higher than the national average of about 21 cents. The agreement met with immediate criticism from some advocacy groups. “These leaders have foolishly paired a big package of tax cuts that will disproportionately benefit   New Jerseyans while decimating the state’s ability to pay for essential services, promised obligations and other critical investments,” said Jon Whiten, the vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspectives. “While it is absolutely essential that New Jersey invest in its transportation infrastructure, that investment should not be held hostage to some warped idea of   tax fairness that will cost the state well over $1 billion a year,” Mr. Whiten added. “This is, quite simply, the wrong path forward for New Jersey. ” Mr. Christie said the trust fund would receive $2 billion a year for eight years, which he said would be its biggest and longest reauthorization. With federal matching funds, he said, the state would have $32 billion to spend on road and transit projects over the next eight years. The governor said the tax cuts were estimated to save the state’s taxpayers $164 million next year and as much as $1. 4 billion when they are completely in place in 2021.",0,790,21.944444444444443,36,0.2949367088607595,0,0,0,0,96.26738072054528,15.103676913803499,73.24177215189874,49.31645569620253,0.8126582278481013,0.013924050632911392,0.05443037974683544,0.024050632911392405,0.04810126582278481,0.012658227848101266,0.16962025316455695,0.006329113924050633,0,0.0189873417721519,0.10506329113924051,0.0012658227848101266,0.056962025316455694,0,0,0.01139240506329114,0.008860759493670886,0.0670886075949367,0,0.056962025316455694,0.021518987341772152,0.049367088607594936,0,0.0012658227848101266,0.015189873417721518,0.016455696202531647,0.09240506329113925,0,0,0,0,0,0.007594936708860759,0.04177215189873418,0,0,0.4253164556962025,0,0.017721518987341773,0.002531645569620253,0.0037974683544303796,0.039240506329113925,0.002531645569620253,0,0.007594936708860759,0.007594936708860759,0,0.03291139240506329,0.0670886075949367,0.02278481012658228,0.0037974683544303796,0.017721518987341773,0,0.0012658227848101266,0.053164556962025315,0.23417721518987342,0.01139240506329114,0,0.017721518987341773,0.056962025316455694,0.0949367088607595,0.030379746835443037,0.030379746835443037,0.05063291139240506,0.13924050632911392,0.06962025316455696,0.021518987341772152,0,0.02531645569620253,0.15822784810126583,0,0.010126582278481013,0.008860759493670886,0.0037974683544303796,0,0,0,0.020253164556962026,0.07974683544303797,0.06455696202531645,0,0.008860759493670886,0.0012658227848101266,0.07341772151898734,0.09620253164556962,0.1,0.005063291139240506,0.06582278481012659,0,26.7,0,29.05,0,11,4,3,17.075,0,14,3,18,57,0,26.7,0,93.7,7,75.05,175.75,93.7,,0.49875949239558626,0,0.5198378002346468,0,0.29075287651080506,0.12973190755680383,0.10056040392403998,0.3888829292943965,0,0.3428614889693982,0.10056040392403998,0.40149162409079436,0.6799246751246121,0,0.5015528100075709,0,0.10310866574965613,0.007702888583218707,0.082585969738652,0.19339752407152683,0.4956986387059452,0.8066024759284731,57
251,"On Tuesday’s “Good Morning America,”   George Stephanopoulos and ABC Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz stated that the attack in Manchester could lead to   backlash.  Stephanapolous said that while people are determined to go back to their normal lives, “this is also likely to inflame   sentiment across Britain, across Europe. ” Raddatz responded, “It sure could, George. You know, Manchester itself is a very multicultural city. There’s a large Muslim population, with many there for generations. So, a headscarf attracts little attention there. And notably, Manchester did not vote in favor of Brexit, but an attack like this, as you said, is much bigger than Manchester itself, and will likely create backlash depending, of course, on the details of this attack, George. ” (  WFB) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,130,16.25,8,0.4307692307692308,0,0,0,0,81.37926937926937,33.60439560439559,70.49867374005305,69.28021978021978,0.7461538461538462,0.023076923076923078,0.038461538461538464,0.05384615384615385,0.06923076923076923,0.007692307692307693,0.25384615384615383,0.023076923076923078,0,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,0,0.06923076923076923,0.015384615384615385,0,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0.1076923076923077,0,0.12307692307692308,0.03076923076923077,0.06153846153846154,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.015384615384615385,0.08461538461538462,0,0,0,0,0,0.007692307692307693,0.023076923076923078,0,0,0.43846153846153846,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0.06153846153846154,0.007692307692307693,0,0.023076923076923078,0,0.007692307692307693,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0,0,0.19230769230769232,0.007692307692307693,0.007692307692307693,0.015384615384615385,0.05384615384615385,0.03076923076923077,0.023076923076923078,0.046153846153846156,0.05384615384615385,0.14615384615384616,0.08461538461538462,0.015384615384615385,0,0.046153846153846156,0.15384615384615385,0.007692307692307693,0.007692307692307693,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06923076923076923,0.1,0,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.1076923076923077,0.13076923076923078,0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,7,0,15,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,7,0,11,0,20,31,11,,0.3562502205830146,0,0.5425129290753421,0,0.19170418491404337,0,0,0,0,0,0.19170418491404337,0,0.07326484679668878,0,0,0,0.0728476821192053,0,0.13245033112582782,0.2052980132450331,-0.5015528100075709,0.794701986754967,10
252,"October 26, 2016 “Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.” ~ Georgia Guidestones This is one of the first of ten commandments blazoned across the Georgia Guidestones, an occult monument for which no person or organization has taken credit. Though the monument was commissioned by someone named R.C. Christian more than two decades ago, the true identity of the person who built this specter is still unidentified, and the message is but one of the many examples of a cabalistic desire to cull the population. There are many more ‘hidden’ in plain sight. The Georgie Guidestones state : 1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. 2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity. 3. Unite humanity with a living new language. 4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason. 5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. 6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. 7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials. 8. Balance personal rights with social duties. 9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite. 10.Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature. Though some of these commandments seem harmless enough, the very first describes the supreme sentiment of the mysterious group of masons who erected the stones. If you want further narrative for what they bode, you don’t have to look far. As Stanford University Professor, Paul Ehrlich , the author of The Population Bomb states , “The first task is population control at home. How do we go about it? Many of my colleagues feel that some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. One plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.” We can see clearly that the ‘elite’ class, intent on ridding the planet of its burdensome load, has already poisoned the water of 42 out of 50 states with lead . Pesticides and fertilizers poison the remaining states’ water along with the original 42 states. Male infertility is rising due to these contaminants, and premature births along with miscarriage are more common due to others. If the water doesn’t kill you, it will simply lobotomize you, or at least start the process. Harvard medical has pronounced that fluoridated water lowered IQ scores in children who drank it, and aluminum along with fluoride is a known neurotoxin, also contributing to the rising numbers of Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons, and similar neurodegenerative diseases. READ: 11 Common Symptoms of the Global Depopulation Slow Kill Should poisoning the water be insufficient to keep the population down, we can look to the advice of David Brower, once Executive Director of the Sierra Club and founder of the Friends of the Earth. He suggests that, “Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … All potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.” Forced and coerced sterilization at the hands of the Eugenics Board and other bodies is nothing new. Some investigators recently found that 148 female inmates in two California prisons were sterilized between 2006 to 2010 — and there may be 100 more incidents dating back to the late 1990s. One reporter wrote , “ The women were signed up for the surgery while they were pregnant and housed at either the California Institution for Women in Corona or Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, which is now a men’s prison. Former inmates and prisoner advocates maintain that prison medical staff coerced the women, targeting those deemed likely to return to prison in the future. Crystal Nguyen, a former Valley State Prison inmate who worked in the prison’s infirmary during 2007, said she often overheard medical staff asking inmates who had served multiple prison terms to agree to be sterilized. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, that’s not right,’” Nguyen, 28, said. “ Do they think they’re animals, and they don’t want them to breed anymore? ” Today vaccines are used in a similar manner to help cull the population against their informed consent. Eugenicist, Bill Gates tried to ‘ field test ’ his HPV vaccine in India on indigenous young girls, but the Indian government eventually brought a stop to this. The Rockefeller family also quietly funds vaccines that alter a woman’s hormones to make her less likely to become pregnant or to maintain a pregnancy.

Clark explains what the elites were planning as early as the 1930s. “ Other lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, Max Mason of the Rockefeller Foundation called “anti-hormones”: vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly .” Barack Obama’s top science advisor , John P. Holdren has also said : “ A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men . The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.” A simple look at the peer-reviewed Plos One site offers over 7,500 additional scientific articles that connect vaccines to sterilization. Should vaccines or forced implants be insufficient to reduce the number of ‘useless eaters’ in the world, as Henry Kissinger has implied, then there is also the revealing text of Dr. John Colemann, who outlines the aims of a Committee of 300, otherwise known as the original hierarchical organization to plan a New World Order . Among their plans are genocide, war, the installation of dictators, the legalization of drug use, and the normalizing of pornography : “To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pot’s genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Rome’s research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. “….To cause by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call ‘useless eaters.’ The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title “Global 2000 Report” and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of State, for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report, the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. “……To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an ‘art-form,’ which will be widely accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.” Look no further than Syria , Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, and a myriad other examples of false flag terrorism . Look no further than the top twenty pharmaceutical companies (all U.S., Illuminati based ) that control almost 99 percent of the world’s massive, ‘legalized’ drug trade. See clearly, the genocide happening around the globe , and the child sex trafficking and pornography which is silently abided in Hollywood, Washington, and in every government circle run by cabal-funded individuals. Look at the money usurped for the task of culling the masses, as former U.S. Secretary of State and presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has stated : “This year, the United States renewed funding of reproductive healthcare through the United Nations Population Fund, and more funding is on the way. The U.S. Congress recently appropriated more than $648 million in foreign assistance to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide . That’s the largest allocation in more than a decade – since we last had a Democratic president, I might add.” Furthermore, weather modification, or geoengineering , also known as chemtrails , additionally help the slow kill , or fast degeneration of the human species. NASA has admitted to using these weather altering programs, so there is no sense denying their presence. Aside from spraying lithium, strontium , barium, nano aluminum-coated fiberglass [known as CHAFF], radioactive thorium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, desiccated blood, mold spores, yellow fungus, and more, these chemical concoctions act as a global pandemic to further population control. Without mention of contaminated food, DARPA contrived control devices, and further attempts to make slaves of the remaining sheeple who live through these demonic efforts, know this; you are swimming in the depopulation agenda. The effects are all around you, and it is high time to put up some kind of resistance.

254,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Carol Adl in News , US // 0 Comments Bernie Sanders sent a letter to President Barack Obama on Friday requesting that he intervene to protect Native Americans who have been peacefully protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. In a statement issued on his official U.S. Senate website, Sanders asked Obama to halt construction of the pipeline until federal officials properly conduct a cultural and environmental review. Recommended President Barack Obama has sneakily approved the construction of two new Dakota pipelines just as the DoJ halted the construction on the existing one. (1 hour ago) At least 140 people were arrested at the construction site on Wednesday after hundreds of police in riot gear moved in with tanks, using sound cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets. Sanders.Senate.gov reports: Hundreds of Native American protectors have gathered at the site since April to protest the pipeline’s construction on land they claim is tribal under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. “I urge you to take all appropriate measures to protect the safety of the Native Americans protesters and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the construction of the pipeline,” Sanders wrote in the letter. Recommended Bernie Sanders joined protests in support of Native American activists who are striving to stop construction of a North Dakota pipeline. (1 hour ago) Sanders asks that President Obama direct the Justice Department to send observers to the site to protect protestors’ safety and First Amendment rights; call North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple to remove the National Guard from the protest camp; and direct the Army Corps of Engineers to issue an order to stop work on construction of the pipeline near the protest site to reduce tensions while awaiting judicial action. Sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline until the Army Corps of Engineers completes a full cultural and environmental review. “It is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities,” Sanders wrote. “Mr. President, you took a bold and principled stand against the Keystone pipeline – I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline.” Sanders previously called on the president to block construction of the pipeline during a rally outside the White House with leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other tribal nations in September.",1,409,31.46153846153846,13,0.42053789731051344,0,0,0,0,99,27.207851127411033,79.70266232002174,34.24069546318935,0.7530562347188264,0.012224938875305624,0.02689486552567237,0.004889975550122249,0.039119804400977995,0.019559902200488997,0.10024449877750612,0.012224938875305624,0.004889975550122249,0.004889975550122249,0.10757946210268948,0,0.02444987775061125,0,0,0.004889975550122249,0.004889975550122249,0.019559902200488997,0.0024449877750611247,0.019559902200488997,0.009779951100244499,0.03178484107579462,0,0,0.007334963325183374,0,0.1271393643031785,0,0,0,0,0,0.0024449877750611247,0.03667481662591687,0,0,0.3863080684596577,0,0.0024449877750611247,0.0024449877750611247,0.007334963325183374,0.019559902200488997,0.0024449877750611247,0,0.0024449877750611247,0.007334963325183374,0.0024449877750611247,0.007334963325183374,0.0024449877750611247,0.014669926650366748,0,0.017114914425427872,0.0024449877750611247,0,0.029339853300733496,0.13447432762836187,0.007334963325183374,0.004889975550122249,0.007334963325183374,0.04156479217603912,0.08312958435207823,0.029339853300733496,0.022004889975550123,0.05867970660146699,0.17603911980440098,0.0488997555012225,0.004889975550122249,0,0.014669926650366748,0.16136919315403422,0,0.017114914425427872,0.022004889975550123,0,0.0024449877750611247,0.004889975550122249,0,0.004889975550122249,0.08557457212713937,0.09046454767726161,0,0,0.004889975550122249,0.05378973105134474,0.07823960880195599,0.06845965770171149,0.0024449877750611247,0.07823960880195599,0.009779951100244499,5,0,46,0,22,0,22,0,5,29.075000000000003,5,4,14,0,5,0,50,22,63.075,117.075,50,,0.23669181907653403,0,0.7404484305800288,0,0.5770565137270707,0,0.5770565137270707,0,0.23669181907653403,0.6432591075492601,0.23669181907653403,0.1987625491245426,0.46473776488061547,0,0,0,0.10099479876786346,0.04443771145785992,0.12740493864565977,0.23647932131495228,-0.5341803029080306,0.7635206786850477,31
255,"Google has revealed a new jobs section for their search engine, which will allow users to find job listings in their area, along with commute times and employer ratings. [“At Google   this year, we announced Google for Jobs, a new   initiative focused on helping both job seekers and employers, through collaboration with the job matching industry,” declared Google in an official blog post on Tuesday. “One major part of this effort is launching an improved experience for job seekers on Google Search.

256,"He won six N. B. A. championships, is the greatest scorer ever and once netted 38 points while battling the flu. The logo of a   sneaker brand is a silhouette of him flying through the air. But on Twitter, Michael Jordan is a loser. For the past two years, a photograph of Jordan crying, snapped at his 2009 induction into basketball’s Hall of Fame, has been grafted onto any sports figure who has suffered humiliation or defeat. No one is seemingly safe from the Crying Jordan treatment. When the New England Patriots lost to the Denver Broncos in the N. F. L. playoffs this year, Tom Brady got Crying Jordaned. He’s joined by the University of North Carolina mascot Rameses and the Villanova band member who cried as she played the piccolo during her team’s stunning N. C. A. A. tournament defeat last year. Recently, Jordan’s cry face has transcended sports. It has graced the cracked Liberty Bell, losing Powerball numbers and that picture of Marco Rubio on a gigantic chair. When it was announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, the president’s face got hit. Now you can Crying Jordan your friends: The “Crying Jordan Meme Generator” app, which serves up little Crying Jordan cutouts, has been downloaded more than 40, 000 times since its February release. The internet thrives on humiliation. Twitter is always raring for a public shaming. The Crying Jordan meme, which takes one of America’s biggest sports stars and makes him small, indulges those impulses, but it also works on another level as a corrective to online  . The meme’s hold over online culture offers clues about our ambivalent relationship to alpha males in 2016. “It takes somebody so good, so dominant  —   the crème de la crème  —   and it makes him into an international figure of epic failure,” said David Okun, a software developer who created the app. “That’s what’s so great about it. ” But the Crying Jordan meme radiates affection even as it burns. “Memes are used as a weapon,” said Limor Shifman, a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who studies digital culture. “But at the very same time, the weapon creates a kind of affinity between the groups that are fighting, because everybody gets the joke. ” By the way, “Michael actually thinks it’s funny,” his spokeswoman, Estee Portnoy, said. The meme pokes fun at a person’s failures, but it also turns them into an   game, one in which everyone messes up, and everyone receives the same absurd rebuke. It helps that the Crying Jordan often mercifully obscures the shamed person’s face. It’s a little like putting a   over a  . If the meme drags Michael Jordan’s image down with it, his   persona can take the hit. “It doesn’t make you feel bad, like a picture of a crying kid would,” said Courtney M. Cox, who studies the intersection of sports and technology at the University of Southern California. “He’s the greatest basketball player ever. The lowest we’ve ever seen him is crying at the Hall of Fame. ” Crying Jordan recalls other memes inspired by famous men caught in introspective moments. There is Sad Kanye, a meme based on a candid photograph of Kanye West looking dejected on a   tour, and Sad Keanu, which plays off a paparazzi photo of Keanu Reeves eating a sandwich alone. “There’s an element of flawed masculinity at play,” Ms. Shifman said. “You have a masculine star who expresses vulnerability, and people simultaneously mock and celebrate that. ” The Jordan meme can be read as straightforwardly emasculating: Watch a grown man cry. But it also works as a criticism of traditional maleness. The meme revels in the contradiction between Jordan’s legendarily aggressive persona and his   tears. The joke probably couldn’t work with any other sports star: Magic Johnson was a   passer, Tom Brady is a   but Jordan’s dominance on the court was matched only by his nerve. He came back from retirement  —   twice. And his Hall of Fame speech, in which he resurrected old feuds, extended that reputation. “Jordan is the ultimate alpha male, and this was his alpha male moment,” a columnist for ESPN  wrote after the event. Only in the snapshot does he look oddly pitiful: eyes red, shoulders slouched, cheeks shiny with tears. The meme makes fun at the guy who cried like a little girl over what a big man he was. It’s not a coincidence that the Jordan meme took off just as N. B. A. stars used the sport’s biggest stages to model humility and playfulness. Modern masculinity in basketball is Kevin Durant, the most valuable player of 2014, calling his mother “the real M. V. P. ” It’s Stephen Curry ceding the spotlight to his daughter Riley at a news conference. The meme seems to share that sense of perspective. Some iterations of the Jordan meme work as bizarre visual gags: replacing Michael Jackson on the cover of “Thriller” making up James Harden’s beard with layer upon layer of Crying Jordans. Other variations rely on sheer volume: As the Oklahoma City Thunder stumbled in the N. B. A. playoffs, every Thunder fan visible in the stands became a target. Perhaps the most technologically advanced and contextually creative Crying Jordan plays off LeBron James’s pregame ritual. When he tosses some chalk above his head, an ephemeral Crying Jordan appears, then dissipates into the air. When Jordan made a rare public appearance in April, showing up at an N. C. A. A. tournament game at his alma mater, North Carolina, the meme threatened to turn meta. Sure enough, the Tar Heels were upset and, in countless tweets, so was Jordan. “Memes, they come and they go, but this is unlike any I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Okun, the app’s creator, said. “It keeps feeling like it’s going to die, and it doesn’t. It only gets bigger. ” He added, “I hope it never stops. ” After all, the meme has helped extend Jordan’s legacy, if not exactly honor it. “I just hope that when kids say: ‘Mommy? Daddy? Who’s that crying basketball guy? ’,” Mr. Okun said. “They tell them: ‘That’s the greatest basketball player of all time. That’s Michael Jordan. ’”",0,1060,12.619047619047619,84,0.30283018867924527,0,0,0,0,91.63864555256065,7.946408007795201,79.14779874213836,5.573375262054506,0.7632075471698113,0.020754716981132074,0.045283018867924525,0.03207547169811321,0.08113207547169811,0.016037735849056604,0.22641509433962265,0.013207547169811321,0.005660377358490566,0.033962264150943396,0.10660377358490566,0,0.05,0.013207547169811321,0.009433962264150943,0.01509433962264151,0.014150943396226415,0.07641509433962264,0.007547169811320755,0.062264150943396226,0.027358490566037737,0.05,0,0.0009433962264150943,0.017924528301886792,0.006603773584905661,0.08113207547169811,0,0.0037735849056603774,0.0037735849056603774,0.006603773584905661,0,0.0037735849056603774,0.04150943396226415,0.002830188679245283,0.002830188679245283,0.4169811320754717,0.0009433962264150943,0.011320754716981131,0,0.002830188679245283,0.059433962264150944,0.007547169811320755,0.002830188679245283,0.012264150943396227,0.018867924528301886,0.026415094339622643,0.035849056603773584,0.0009433962264150943,0.014150943396226415,0.006603773584905661,0.05,0.007547169811320755,0,0.013207547169811321,0.22169811320754718,0.0037735849056603774,0,0.0330188679245283,0.08018867924528301,0.048113207547169815,0.03773584905660377,0.031132075471698113,0.040566037735849055,0.11320754716981132,0.09716981132075472,0.013207547169811321,0.002830188679245283,0.035849056603773584,0.12358490566037736,0.0018867924528301887,0.013207547169811321,0.006603773584905661,0.031132075471698113,0.016981132075471698,0,0,0.024528301886792454,0.10283018867924529,0.07264150943396226,0,0.01981132075471698,0.0047169811320754715,0.038679245283018866,0.11320754716981132,0.1320754716981132,0.0018867924528301887,0.018867924528301886,0.0037735849056603774,93.2,21.375,46,2,6,11,11,31,19.83,39.725,11.625,46,36.825,0,93.2,0,197.40500000000003,25,282.35,496.0299999999999,197.40500000000003,,0.694548966985182,0.34275239325145856,0.5288097684941145,0.04652482465851837,0.12769271191181897,0.21158809089302266,0.21158809089302266,0.4306285048386512,0.32605584222082334,0.4921771824549347,0.22095382346184184,0.5288097684941145,0.47325116883128354,0,0.8099008849131154,0,0.1372746048413455,0.017384894612768858,0.1963449997566115,0.3449371709908694,-0.7456040990546026,0.6550628290091306,118
257,"During Saturday’s Democratic Weekly Address, House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Representative Linda Sánchez ( ) stated, ” Recently we have seen the President use fear  —   fear of Muslims and fear of immigrants  —   as a tool to promote his misguided and poorly developed policies. Policies that not only undermine our American values, but also jeopardize our safety and harm our economy. ”  Transcript as Follows: “Hello. I’m California Congresswoman Linda Sánchez, Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus. I am proud to share my family’s story because it is an American story. I am the daughter of immigrants. My parents came here from Mexico. Like so many immigrants, my parents came to this country and worked hard every day to provide for me, my six brothers and sisters. My father, Ignacio, was an industrial mechanic. My mother, Maria, became an elementary school teacher after first raising a family. They owned their own home. They sent all seven of their children to college. And we give back every day to this country we love. In fact  —   my parents are the only parents in our nation’s   history to send  —   not one  —   but TWO daughters to the United States Congress! My mother and father saved and sacrificed to achieve the American Dream for our family. They weren’t handed their success  —   they earned it! Immigrants, like my parents, are working and contributing to the success of our country every day. They are starting businesses which create jobs, caring for our children and aging parents, serving in our military, and they harvest and prepare the food we eat. Immigrants are woven into the fabric of our country because we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. Recently we have seen the President use fear  —   fear of Muslims and fear of immigrants  —   as a tool to promote his misguided and poorly developed policies. Policies that not only undermine our American values, but also jeopardize our safety and harm our economy. Democrats agree that removing violent criminals should be the priority. But tearing families apart through mass deportations does not make our country safer and wastes our precious resources. Banning refugees who have already been thoroughly vetted wastes resources. Building useless walls instead of fixing our roads and bridges wastes resources. We cannot let the politics of fear and suspicion, distract us from our priorities. Democrats want to make this country work for all Americans. We believe in making America greater by fighting for economic growth that benefits everyone. Our agenda is simple: Keep America safe, keep America working, and keep America moving forward. And I know that so many of you share those same priorities. Over the past month, millions of Americans are getting involved and taking action in their communities. We have seen organized demonstrations in cities all across our country. Men and women from every walk of life coming together to stand up and speak out against a hateful and divisive agenda. They are sending a clear message: We will resist. We will persist. It was volunteer lawyers with laptops sitting on cold airport floors that led the fight against the President’s reckless Muslim ban. It was a group of entrepreneurial women who organized a march in Washington with crowds surpassing the inauguration. President Lincoln said, ‘Public sentiment is everything.’ Because in this country, it is the people who have the ultimate power. I beg you, keep flexing your power. The fight we are in right now is not a fight over politics. It is a fight for the future of our country. And we are in this fight together.

258,"1212 Views November 07, 2016 5 Comments Blog, Community News and Announcements The Saker It is with great sadness that we, the Saker Community, have decided to sever our ties with the German Saker blog. For many years the German Saker blog has been one of the most successful and dedicated blogs of our community and we want to sincerely thank Dagmar Henn for the superb job she did as the person in charge of this blog. Recently, however, the German Saker blog has taken a very different tone and has made a number of accusations and statements which have convinced us that we need to part ways. We do that with great sadness. We reserve the right to start another “community approved” German Saker blog in the future with a different domain name and we express the hope that the current administrators of the so-called “saker.de 2.0″ will agree to stop using the word “saker” in their domain and blog name. Any future use of that word by the “saker.de 2.0″ would be morally illegitimate and misleading.

259,"WASHINGTON  —   They are members of the Club Nobody Wants to Be a Part Of. And their numbers are growing. With every mass shooting in America, a somber scene replays itself here. Victims’ families and survivors of massacres  —   Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson, Sandy Hook, Charleston, San Bernardino  —   traipse up to Capitol Hill. They knock on lawmakers’ doors, attend news conferences and bear witness to Senate votes on gun measures that almost never pass. So there was a sense of déjà vu here on Monday as the Senate rejected four gun safety measures, one week after the Pulse nightclub massacre, which killed 49 and injured 53, in Orlando, Fla. Erica Lafferty Smegielski, 30, whose mother was the principal killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, spent the day wandering the corridors of Congress with Colin Goddard, also 30, whose body still holds three bullets fired by the gunman at Virginia Tech in 2007. They stopped for a quick bite in a cafeteria, and ran into Patricia Maisch, 67, who, in 2011, was waiting in Tucson to have a picture taken with her congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, and helped end the massacre by grabbing the gunman’s ammunition clip. They all hugged. “It’s like, every time we come together for something like this, there is someone new we are introduced to for the first time, and we know the road that’s ahead of them,” said Ms. Smegielski over a basket of chicken nuggets. A tattoo honoring her mother is on her right arm. She looked at Mr. Goddard, to her right both work for Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy organization backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. “Just like you were there for me three years ago,” she told him. “And now, I’m somebody’s Colin. ” Mrs. Maisch had cut short a family reunion in St. Louis to be here for the vote. In 2013, when the Senate voted against gun safety measures that President Obama pushed for after the Sandy Hook shooting, she stood up in the Senate gallery, looked down at the lawmakers and shouted, “Shame on you!” She was escorted out by the police and detained for two hours. On Monday, she wore an orange button that read “Survivor” and a collection of colored plastic wristbands, each one representing a shooting victim. One was for a congressional candidate from Wisconsin whose mother killed herself. One was for Jordan Davis, a    student shot in Florida, by someone who complained about his loud music. One was for Dawn Hochsprung, Ms. Smegielski’s mother. “These are all people I know,” she said. Gun safety advocates said they were not aware of any survivors or relatives from Orlando here it was simply too soon, they said. Lori Haas, whose daughter was badly injured at Virginia Tech, and who is now the Virginia state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, was in Orlando with family members on Monday. “This is like a very, very, very bad Groundhog Day movie,” she said in a telephone interview from the offices of Equality Florida, a gay rights advocacy group. Her presence there suggests a possible change after the rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Leaders of the gay rights movement, which is   and   are now putting their muscle behind gun safety. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said gun safety advocates hope to pattern their efforts after the campaign to legalize   marriage. If they cannot win in Washington, they will try to win in the states. They cite some progress: Since the Sandy Hook shooting, 42 states have passed some sort of gun safety legislation, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Mr. Gross’ group helped run a social media campaign using the hashtag #DisarmHate he said it resulted in 150, 000 telephone calls to lawmakers last week  —   10 times the number of calls the movement generated after last year’s massacre in San Bernardino, Calif. “There’s a moment for every great issue and every great movement  —   usually in hindsight  —   that when you look back and say, ‘That’s when things started to change,’” he said. “And for the issue of gun violence, that moment is now. ” As senators voted on Monday, advocates with the Brady campaign sat in the gallery wearing orange   with the slogan #Enough Gun Violence. Afterward, Ms. Smegielski dabbed tears from her eyes. Mrs. Maisch said she was not surprised. Tina Meins, whose father was killed in San Bernardino, watched the vote from afar she had been here last week to attend a news conference with Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who held a   filibuster intended to force his colleagues to take up the issue of guns. She, like the others, expected the measures to fail. The life of a   advocate, she said, can be “extremely frustrating. ” And the club is growing. “In San Bernardino, we had 14 families,” Ms. Meins said. “Now we have 49. ”",0,837,18.195652173913043,46,0.30824372759856633,0,0,0.0023894862604540022,0,94.10777341601714,9.194068134108228,87.91527076780532,11.7570306038048,0.7933094384707288,0.016726403823178016,0.03106332138590203,0.04062126642771804,0.04659498207885305,0.026284348864994027,0.2078853046594982,0.007168458781362007,0.0011947431302270011,0.015531660692951015,0.08124253285543608,0,0.052568697729988054,0.025089605734767026,0.014336917562724014,0.009557945041816009,0.009557945041816009,0.05017921146953405,0.0011947431302270011,0.0884109916367981,0.016726403823178016,0.03106332138590203,0,0.009557945041816009,0.008363201911589008,0.0047789725209080045,0.1111111111111111,0.0011947431302270011,0.014336917562724014,0.005973715651135006,0.03464755077658303,0,0.007168458781362007,0.05854241338112306,0.0011947431302270011,0.0011947431302270011,0.43966547192353644,0.0047789725209080045,0.02031063321385902,0.005973715651135006,0.0035842293906810036,0.038231780167264036,0.0035842293906810036,0.0011947431302270011,0.0047789725209080045,0.016726403823178016,0.010752688172043012,0.009557945041816009,0.0011947431302270011,0.019115890083632018,0.005973715651135006,0.02867383512544803,0.0035842293906810036,0,0.02986857825567503,0.2114695340501792,0.009557945041816009,0,0.038231780167264036,0.06212664277180406,0.054958183990442055,0.056152927120669056,0.017921146953405017,0.054958183990442055,0.15292712066905614,0.09438470728793309,0.017921146953405017,0,0.02986857825567503,0.14575866188769415,0,0.007168458781362007,0.015531660692951015,0.0035842293906810036,0.010752688172043012,0,0.008363201911589008,0.027479091995221028,0.12544802867383512,0.06451612903225806,0,0.017921146953405017,0.015531660692951015,0.06332138590203107,0.11708482676224612,0.1111111111111111,0.005973715651135006,0.03225806451612903,0.0035842293906810036,17,0,185.8525,5,7.73,0,9,52.74609375,5.75,107.60249999999999,13,8,21,12,17,0,55.480000000000004,9,294.32859375,358.80859375,55.480000000000004,,0.35916882756815444,0,0.8596959001267569,0.141516769699476,0.20309235419692082,0,0.228824214524262,0.6349015449461538,0.15936143777119094,0.7801013427753791,0.30001268054684505,0.20870562407669346,0.4091055058462009,0.28347683159081755,0.6315929975545277,0,0.049811071948375335,0.008080382976484822,0.26425419538113526,0.3221456503059954,-0.9176030605442435,0.6778543496940046,82
260,"Images reveal crashed Schiaparelli Mars lander page: 1 link We knew as time passed that Schiaparelli had failed in its mission to become ESA's first working lab on mars , now the efforts of ESA to locate their missing lander have provided the proof that Schiaparelli crashed on Mars , as suggested by the data returned before the event. If at first you don't succeed Looks like an impact crater to me. Mars succès rate is all told about 50%? originally posted by: gortex the efforts of ESA to locate their missing lander have provided the proof that Schiaparelli crashed on Mars R.I.P Schiaparelli, you never even got a chance to reveal some of the secrets of Mars. Okay, we're on a conspiracy site, i'll say it... Looks like an impact crater to me. Schiaparelli's impact. NASA have a good success rate landing on Mars probably due to them being well funded , in comparison ESA don't seem to have all of their ducks in a line to be able to take the next step. Shame really as we are going looking for life where NASA seems content to look for the conditions that would have allowed life to start. originally posted by: gortex NASA have a good success rate landing on Mars probably due to them being well funded , Shame really as we are going looking for life where NASA seems content to look for the conditions that would have allowed life to start. Nasa does have a good success rate, Curiosity's wacky landing putting the cream on the cake, since it obviously worked. Ihave to say though it's kind of weird that there were two failed events.

261,"An education watch coalition of grassroots parents and other citizens representing 27 states is letting the Senate know its concerns about education department secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. [With DeVos’ confirmation hearing rescheduled to begin January 17, members of Education Liberty Watch have sent a letter detailing their concerns to Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander ( ) ranking member Sen. Patty Murray ( ) and the committee’s other members.  “This national coalition of grassroots parent and citizen organizations has many questions and concerns about Betsy DeVos,” the group’s president, Dr. Karen Effrem, tells Breitbart News. “Chief among them is her apparent very recent conversion to opposing Common Core when her activist and philanthropic record shows concrete evidence of strong support for the standards over many years. ” While, upon her nomination, DeVos launched a new website on which she stated she is “certainly” not a supporter of Common Core, she has served on boards and funded organizations that have been vocal supporters of the standards. Additionally, she has been strongly endorsed by former GOP presidential candidate and Common Core promoter Jeb Bush, his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, former GOP presidential nominee and “ ” Mitt Romney, former education secretary William Bennett  —   who received compensation for promoting Common Core among conservatives, the   Core Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and the Bill   Fordham Institute, which has also promoted Common Core. “There is also great concern about her support of voucher programs imposing Common Core on private and potentially home schools, and extensive student data mining,” Effrem continues. “These concerns are especially acute given   Trump’s encouraging and repeated promises to get rid of Common Core, protect privacy and decrease or eliminate the federal role in education. ” Effrem summarizes the letter and the group’s concerns: 1) From all the evidence we can find, her statement when she was appointed on November 23rd was her very first against Common Core. Her statements and record via organizations that she has founded, funded, chaired, or on whose boards she has served and her political contributions have all been in support of Common Core and   Core candidates. Her statement and her interview with Donald Trump focused on “higher standards” which is a euphemism for Common Core, even though there is abundant evidence that the Common Core standards are anything but high. 2) Her American Federation for Children group has been strongly in support of state voucher laws in Indiana and Louisiana or federal Title I portability that imposes or would impose Common Core on private schools via the federally mandated state assessments. The education savings accounts that she touts could well place government regulations on home schooling for “accountability” purposes. 3) Although a strong supporter of charter schools, it appears she has never financially supported classical charter schools like the Hillsdale model in her own home state, only charters that require the teaching and testing of Common Core. 4) The Philanthropy Roundtable that she chaired until her appointment put out a report that is strongly in favor of extensive data mining of children without transparency of what data is collected and who receives it or parental consent and never mentions the word “privacy. ” 5) We are also concerned about continued expansion of invasive, subjective social emotional learning programs at the federal level and need to know her position on those. “We strongly urge the Senate HELP Committee to closely question her about these critical issues,” Effrem says.

263,"Donald Trump appeared at three inaugural balls to celebrate his supporters’ victory, and to promise a determined push for their shared campaign goals. [“Well, we did it,” he told a cheering crowd at his first speech, given at the Liberty Ball. He continued:  Now the work begins. There are no game, no games, right? We’re not playing games. I want to thank everybody. We love you. We’re going to be working for you, and we’re going to be producing results. “Now the work begins,” he said at his second speech, given at the Freedom Ball.  “We did a good job together   …     there has never been a movement like this anywhere in the world,” he told his enthusiastic supporters.  “We will not be taken advantage of anymore. We’re going to have those great companies come pouring back in,” Trump said. “We are not going to let you down. Remember the theme: Make America Great Again   …     greater than ever before  —   it will happen,” he said.  Trump also promised to keep Tweeting, saying: Should I keep the Twitter going or not?

264,"WASHINGTON  —   In naming Stephen K. Bannon to a senior White House post,   Donald J. Trump has elevated the   nationalist movement that Mr. Bannon has nurtured for years from the fringes of American politics to its very heart, a remarkable shift that has further intensified concern about the new administration’s direction. The provocative news and opinion website that Mr. Bannon ran, Breitbart News, has repeatedly published articles linking migrants to the spread of disease. Its authors have criticized politicians who do not support a religious test for immigrants to screen out potential jihadists. And it has promoted stories that tried to tie Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton who is Muslim, to Islamic militants. In an interview, Mr. Bannon, 62, rejected what he called the “ ” tendencies of some in the movement. His interest in populism and American nationalism, he said, has to do with curbing what he sees as the corrosive effects of globalization. And he believes his enemies are misstating his views and those of many Trump followers. “These people are patriots,” he said. “They love their country. They just want their country taken care of. ” He added, “It’s not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, aren’t bad guys  —   racists,  . But that’s irrelevant. ” Some of Mr. Bannon’s own statements and behavior have drawn the condemnation of faith leaders and   groups, which reacted to his appointment with alarm on Monday. Jewish groups pointed to allegations from Mr. Bannon’s   that he had made   comments about the students at his daughter’s school. Critics have resurfaced other episodes from his past, including a 2011 interview in which he mocked liberals who criticize conservative women as “a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools. ” Mr. Bannon’s ascent has quickly become the focus of those critics, who broadly condemned the choice as divisive, if not racist, on Monday. But it was also a victory of   dimensions for a man who is relatively new to the  ’s inner circle. When Mr. Bannon joined Mr. Trump’s sputtering presidential campaign in August, he insisted to his friends that even if Mr. Trump lost, he could at least mitigate any damage to the nationalist movement, which he helped fuel as the head of Breitbart. Instead, that nationalist movement  —   which has promoted and enabled     and racist sentiments  —   will now have a champion at Mr. Trump’s side in the West Wing. The place that Mr. Bannon will occupy in the new administration, as senior counselor and chief strategist, also elevates to one of the most powerful roles in government someone whose mission in politics has been to tear down institutions, not run them. His appointment was intended to be a reassuring signal to the vocal and restive members of Mr. Trump’s populist,   base who are suspicious of power and anyone who holds it. Mr. Trump is their champion, but Mr. Bannon is their check against the Washington establishment and any efforts it makes to soften the new president’s resolve. Mr. Bannon does not come out of the usual political or ideological backgrounds that have shaped the Republican Party in recent decades. He is not a religious conservative who is focused on social issues. He is not a traditional economic conservative. What especially motivates Mr. Bannon, his friends and colleagues say, is a sense that the country’s cultural and political elite are contemptuous of ordinary Americans. That endeared him to Mr. Trump, who never felt he received the respect he deserved for building such a large political movement. That “arrogance of the elites,” as Mr. Bannon has said, explains why most of the media and political class missed the rise of Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon’s disgust with the politics of the mainstream Republican Party burns just as hot as, if not hotter than, his animus toward liberals. He sees Republicans as the “party of Davos donors” and has scorned them for denigrating Trump supporters as the “vulgarians, the hobbits” and “the peasants with the pitchforks. ” He is close to Sarah Palin, and at one point he urged her to take up the kind of Republican versus Republican battle he relishes: a primary campaign against Senator John McCain, her 2008 running mate. (She declined.) He was behind some of the Trump campaign’s most inflammatory moves, like inviting several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual advances to sit in Mr. Trump’s family box during a debate. He had never worked on a national campaign until signing on with Mr. Trump, and has had eclectic taste in careers. He served as a Navy officer and went into banking for Goldman Sachs. He also helped run Biosphere 2, the domed ecosystem in Arizona where people lived without contact with the outside world. Like many leaders of the emerging   movement, he became engaged in politics with the rise of the Tea Party early in President Obama’s first term. He felt that the government’s bailout of the banking system was an egregious misuse of taxpayer dollars that did almost nothing to help ordinary Americans. His reason was personal: His father, a former telephone company lineman, had to sell off stock in his retirement account to make ends meet. Mr. Bannon has told people in Mr. Trump’s inner circle that the new administration will have a short window of time to push its agenda through and should focus first on the priorities that are expected to be the most contentious. Ever hungry for political combat, Mr. Bannon is expected to be an unrelenting advocate for many of Mr. Trump’s most aggressive plans on immigration. That involves stopping the immigration of Syrian refugees, deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records and devoting more resources to securing the border. Mr. Bannon, who grew up in a   neighborhood in Norfolk, Va. earned degrees from Georgetown and Harvard. He often compares Mr. Trump’s political rise to that of Andrew Jackson, the military general and populist hero who took on the political and social elite of his day as the seventh president of the United States. While Mr. Trump became the leader of the movement of disaffected Americans who feel lost and disenfranchised in a nation undergoing rapid cultural and demographic change, Mr. Bannon has been a student of global populist trends, carefully tracking the rise of the   National Front in France under Marine Le Pen and the remarkable victory of the U. K. Independence Party in Britain’s vote this year to leave the European Union. “Steve saw  —   and was a thought leader and a visionary about  —   the issues and the movement that Trump eventually caught on to and espoused,” said Larry Solov, the chief executive of Breitbart. “He’s like a field general,” Mr. Solov added, “and very much sees the fight for the soul of this country as a war. ” Mr. Bannon will take his White House job already at odds with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, an ally of Mr. Priebus’s whom Mr. Bannon has long sought to undermine. When he ran Breitbart, Mr. Bannon promoted Mr. Ryan’s opponent in the Wisconsin primary in the website’s news stories and radio interviews. Mr. Bannon is personally close to members of Congress like Dave Brat, the Virginia Republican who unseated Eric Cantor, the former majority leader. He has written that the appropriations process under Mr. Ryan was “a total and complete sellout of the American people. ” His former colleagues at Breitbart refer to him admiringly as a “honey badger” because of his relentlessness  —   a quality they now expect him to turn on Washington. “What drives Steve,” said Joel B. Pollak, Breitbart’s editor at large, “is the way the political establishment is holding back American politics. ”",0,1298,21.633333333333333,60,0.3436055469953775,0,0,0,0,93.04961590651357,5.646664383952518,88.22001303780965,27.05069337442219,0.7796610169491526,0.02465331278890601,0.05007704160246533,0.02234206471494607,0.03389830508474576,0.020030816640986132,0.17950693374422189,0.006933744221879815,0.0015408320493066256,0.02157164869029276,0.08551617873651772,0.0015408320493066256,0.05546995377503852,0.009244992295839754,0.0015408320493066256,0.010015408320493066,0.00539291217257319,0.0662557781201849,0.0015408320493066256,0.05007704160246533,0.026964560862865947,0.05084745762711865,0,0.0007704160246533128,0.017719568567026195,0.006933744221879815,0.1263482280431433,0,0.0030816640986132513,0.004622496147919877,0.00539291217257319,0,0.007704160246533128,0.04314329738058552,0.00847457627118644,0.00847457627118644,0.4437596302003082,0.0023112480739599386,0.00847457627118644,0.004622496147919877,0,0.0485362095531587,0.0030816640986132513,0.0023112480739599386,0.015408320493066256,0.02157164869029276,0.006933744221879815,0.06933744221879815,0.0061633281972265025,0.026194144838212634,0.010015408320493066,0.016178736517719568,0.0030816640986132513,0,0.007704160246533128,0.19799691833590138,0.00539291217257319,0.0007704160246533128,0.023882896764252697,0.07550077041602465,0.0724191063174114,0.04776579352850539,0.01694915254237288,0.08320493066255778,0.14714946070878274,0.0963020030816641,0.020030816640986132,0,0.02465331278890601,0.12865947611710324,0.0061633281972265025,0.010015408320493066,0.00539291217257319,0.0030816640986132513,0.00847457627118644,0,0.0023112480739599386,0.040061633281972264,0.14560862865947613,0.07318952234206472,0,0.01848998459167951,0.006933744221879815,0.03389830508474576,0.11016949152542373,0.10092449922958398,0,0.05161787365177196,0.0007704160246533128,39,0,105.25,0,2,12,16,73.35,5.83,35,8.625,27,71.625,0,39,0,150.07999999999998,32,171.375,348.45500000000004,150.07999999999998,,0.5295961685242233,0,0.752371402364451,0,0.054583639049126324,0.2572842744474721,0.31594942629453465,0.6792231670195681,0.14405370940510864,0.5025773880714357,0.19934814358278716,0.4380200341554007,0.674016045712762,0,0.41917461527728456,0,0.0969850496460317,0.020679115063119768,0.1107463544981922,0.22517940747873125,-0.4650589146560654,0.7748205925212688,99

And although he occasionally invited conservative columnists, “  columnists from newspapers tend to dominate at Mr. Obama’s secret sessions. ” Obama’s private briefings for liberal members of the media, which excluded conservatives, were  . A few: On Friday, CNN media reporter Dylan Byers expressed concern at the alleged exclusion of   media outlets. Yet in 2015, he wrote about the frequency of Obama’s private meetings with journalists.

266,"2,700-year-old Hebrew mention of Jerusalem found Rare papyrus from 7th century B.C. refers to consignment of wineskins Published: 26 mins ago (Times of Israel) A rare, ancient papyrus dating to the First Temple Period — 2,700 years ago — has been found to bear the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew. The fragile text, believed plundered from a cave in the Judean Desert cave, was apparently acquired by the Israel Antiquities Authority during a sting in 2012 when thieves attempted to sell it to a dealer. Radiocarbon dating has determined it is from the 7th century BCE, making it one of just three extant Hebrew papyri from that period, and predating the Dead Sea Scrolls by centuries. The IAA’s Eitan Klein said the dating of the papyrus had been confirmed by comparing the text’s orthography with other texts from the period.",1,145,29,5,0.35172413793103446,0,0,0,0,99,47.931034482758626,63.49336870026525,25.774193548387096,0.7241379310344828,0.027586206896551724,0.034482758620689655,0.020689655172413793,0.013793103448275862,0.020689655172413793,0.14482758620689656,0,0,0.013793103448275862,0.1103448275862069,0,0.04827586206896552,0,0,0.006896551724137931,0,0.06206896551724138,0.006896551724137931,0.04827586206896552,0.013793103448275862,0.013793103448275862,0.013793103448275862,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0,0.04827586206896552,0,0,0.006896551724137931,0,0,0,0.07586206896551724,0,0,0.38620689655172413,0,0.013793103448275862,0,0,0.034482758620689655,0.006896551724137931,0,0.041379310344827586,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0,0.006896551724137931,0,0,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0,0.06206896551724138,0.2,0.013793103448275862,0.006896551724137931,0.020689655172413793,0.041379310344827586,0.034482758620689655,0,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0.16551724137931034,0.034482758620689655,0,0,0,0.15862068965517243,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.041379310344827586,0.020689655172413793,0,0.006896551724137931,0,0.13793103448275862,0.10344827586206896,0.09655172413793103,0,0.006896551724137931,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,2,7,12,5,,0.2857142857142857,0,0.2857142857142857,0,0,0,0.16666666666666666,0,0.09090909090909091,0.2857142857142857,0,0,0,0,0.3333333333333333,0,0.033112582781456956,0.013245033112582781,0.046357615894039736,0.07947019867549669,-0.2204812092115424,0.9205298013245033,6
267,"We Are Change In perhaps the most disturbing Wikileaks release to date, Tony Podesta (John Podesta’s brother) is invited to a “Spirit Cooking” dinner with performance artist Marina Abramovi?.Dinner with a famous artist might sound deeply mundane, but there is far more to this story.Abramovi?, 69, is a fairly famous Serbian performance artist, who now lives in New York.In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovi? wrote:“Dear Tony,I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?All my love, Marina”Tony then forwarded the email to his brother, John, asking:“Are you in NYC Thursday July 9Marina wants you to come to dinnerMary?”While this seems like a completely normal and uninspiring email, a look at what “spirit cooking” is, changes things immediately.In the video, Abramovi? is seen painting the recipe for these “spirit dinners,” using what appears to be thickly congealed blood. The recipe read, at one point, “mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm, drink on earthquake nights.”So, we have to ask, did John Podesta’s brother invite him to go drink semen mixed with breast milk? Yikes. Abramovi? is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star — which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness.During the next, she ingested a medication to treat people who are catatonic, which caused violent muscle spasms.Perhaps most famously, in 1974, Abramovi? placed 72 objects on a table, including a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel — and a gun and a single bullet. Alongside the items was a sign informing the audience that the items could be used on her in any way that they chose.For six hours, she remained at the mercy of the audience, allowing them to do as they pleased. During that time, she was stripped, cut, and one audience member even held the gun to her head.“What I learned was that … if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you. … I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation,” she later said of the performance.We really just want to know what Podesta had for dinner.The post Spirit Cooking: The Most Disturbing Podesta Email Yet?

268,"DOYLESTOWN, Pa.  —   Donald J. Trump has been waiting for months for a poll in which he cracks 50 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton in any of his top battleground states: Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio or Pennsylvania. “It’ll happen after the conventions,” he said in a July 6 interview. “Believe me. ” But in the last two weeks, instead of attracting a surge of new admirers, Mr. Trump has been hemorrhaging support among loyal Republicans,   independents,   Democrats and others, according to polls and 30 interviews with a   of voters. His dispute with the parents of a Muslim Army captain who was killed in action in Iraq, and his suggestion that “Second Amendment people” could somehow stop Mrs. Clinton, have intensified doubts about Mr. Trump even among Americans who were initially attracted to his frank and freewheeling style. For a candidate who once seemed like an electoral phenomenon, with an unshakable following and a celebrity appeal that crossed party lines, Mr. Trump now faces the possibility that his missteps have erected a ceiling over his support among some demographic groups and in several swing states. He has been stuck under 45 percent of the vote in Ohio and Pennsylvania for weeks, polls show, while Mrs. Clinton has gained support. Several Republican voters say they grow leery every time Mr. Trump speaks these days, for fear he will embarrass them, and feel increasingly repelled just when they hoped he might adjust his message to try to draw more people in. “I liked that he was politically incorrect. But now I feel, enough already,” Trish Grove, a banker, said as she finished lunch at a diner here in Doylestown, a bellwether suburb north of Philadelphia. “He’s not going to win a majority of voters by sounding offensive and ridiculous. ” After the conventions in late July, Mrs. Clinton’s support among young people rose 12 percent, and she gained ground among liberals and moderates, according to an analysis of a New York   News poll before the conventions and a CBS News poll after them. Mr. Trump improved only with voters who held bachelor’s degrees but did not attend graduate school. “Undecided voters still have a long way to go before they vote for Trump,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who holds focus groups with voters. “He has high unfavorable ratings with so many voters that he would need to win most of the rest of the electorate, and his   problems aren’t helping him grow. ” Mr. Trump’s troubles are perhaps most pronounced in Pennsylvania, which he has targeted for victory in November even though the state has gone Democratic in the last six presidential elections. He is running strong in the traditionally conservative western part of the state, and his advisers argue that his populist views on trade, immigration and foreign policy could resonate with independents and   Democrats. “We have to win Pennsylvania,” Mr. Trump said on Friday during a campaign rally in Erie. “We win Pennsylvania, we’re going to win it,” apparently a reference to the presidency. But to carry the state, pollsters say, Mr. Trump would need to beat Mrs. Clinton here in the Philadelphia suburbs, where President Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012 by about nine percentage points. (Mr. Obama carried the state by about five points.) Yet Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead in those suburbs, 52 percent to 26 percent, according to an NBC   Street   College poll published Wednesday. “There is absolutely no way Trump wins Pennsylvania unless he can broaden his appeal significantly and overcome his huge deficit in the suburbs,” said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin  Marshall College poll and a longtime analyst of Pennsylvania politics. “He does well with white   voters, but there simply aren’t enough of them in Pennsylvania to win. And he can’t stick with his political message for more than five minutes. ” Mr. Trump’s advisers expressed confidence in their strategy and questioned whether public polls fully reflect his support. While some did express concern that there could be a ceiling on his support among women and members of minority groups, they also said he had room to grow among   voters, white men and independents  —   who, they said, will not pay attention to the race until the presidential debates begin in late September. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, said the debates would be critical to winning over voters, but he also pointed to increased spending by the Clinton campaign on television ads in Pennsylvania and Ohio as proof of the threat Mr. Trump poses there. “We expect to do very well in the suburbs, which will help us to carry Pennsylvania,” Mr. Manafort said. “The demographics are very positive for Donald Trump and the issue agenda favors Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. ” A Clinton campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but several of Mrs. Clinton’s advisers and allies said they were highly optimistic that she would carry Pennsylvania and most other Rust Belt states. There are few greater threats to candidates than a ceiling on their support, which is why many take more moderate positions during the general election in hopes of appealing to the broadest possible constituency. Republicans and Democrats have a history of nominating presidential candidates genial and ideologically flexible enough to expand their support beyond party loyalists. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have historically high unfavorability ratings and extremely low favorability ratings among undecided voters. Yet since the conventions, Mrs. Clinton has focused her message and campaign schedule on undecided voters in swing states. Mr. Trump has shown little interest in changing his unorthodox approach: In an interview on CNBC on Thursday he said he would “just keep doing the same thing I’m doing right now,” even if he ended up losing. Many   voters here in Bucks County said in interviews that Mr. Trump seemed almost to be willfully trying to alienate them: He says the right things about repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes, but then appears to revel in insulting women and Mexicans and singling out Muslims for harsh treatment. Several voters also cited Mr. Trump’s mocking of a disabled reporter, and others said that he seemed too hotheaded in confrontational situations, such as when he came under criticism from Khizr Khan, the father of the United States Army officer killed in Iraq, during his speech at the Democratic convention. “America’s role in the world matters to me, and I don’t want a president who yells at other people,” said Adam Woldow, a dermatologist in Richboro, Pa. who said he voted for Mr. Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. As he waited for his station wagon to emerge from a carwash, Dr. Woldow paused to consider why Mr. Trump bothered him so much. “He just has so much baggage at this point, all the things he keeps saying,” he said. “I feel he’s even a bit racist. ” Dr. Woldow said he was leaning toward Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Penny   an independent from Morrisville, Pa. who also voted for Mr. Romney, said she was dismayed when Mr. Trump insinuated that Mr. Khan’s wife, Ghazala, had not been “allowed” to speak when she appeared alongside him at the convention. “Who is Trump to make these judgments? Trump speaks all the time with his own wife by his side, silent,” Ms.   said while perusing the lunch menu at a diner in Doylestown. “He should be talking about issues if he wants to actually win people over. ” But Mariann Davies, a lawyer in Doylestown who supports Mr. Trump, predicted that his popularity would grow among voters who do not want Mrs. Clinton to continue the Obama administration’s policies. “He’s talking about the issues everyone is pussyfooting around,” Ms. Davies said of Mr. Trump. “I think he could attract more voters if he would just focus on trade policy and jobs because people around here care a lot about those things. ” For most politicians, a       approach has limits: Candidates who offend too many voters, or look overly impulsive or intemperate, generally lose. But Mr. Trump believes that voters who have seen hard times in their communities will embrace him as a truth teller. In the   cities of northeast Pennsylvania, a traditionally Democratic area where Mr. Trump would need to overperform, several voters said they were skeptical of his leadership skills even though they shared his concerns about immigration and national security. Ody Draklellis, a Republican who owns the Queen City Diner in Allentown, said people in the area were open to Mr. Trump because they mistrusted Mrs. Clinton and were tired of Mr. Obama’s policies. But Mr. Trump’s main problem, Mr. Draklellis added, “is Mr. Trump himself. ” “Could Trump be a good president? Probably. But he might get us into a war, so the risk is too high,” said Mr. Draklellis, who has not chosen a candidate. “You would think he’d be totally focused on all of Hillary’s vulnerabilities. He could grow in the polls that way. Instead he just shoots his mouth off. ”",0,1524,22.746268656716417,67,0.3188976377952756,0,0,0,0,83.20300899887513,5.532079323417904,89.1199236459079,46.30971128608924,0.7775590551181102,0.019028871391076115,0.03280839895013123,0.051181102362204724,0.05249343832020997,0.016404199475065617,0.18503937007874016,0.01115485564304462,0.004593175853018373,0.015748031496062992,0.06299212598425197,0.0006561679790026247,0.05905511811023622,0.00984251968503937,0.001968503937007874,0.00853018372703412,0.007874015748031496,0.09120734908136482,0.0026246719160104987,0.0583989501312336,0.016404199475065617,0.05643044619422572,0,0.001968503937007874,0.02821522309711286,0.01968503937007874,0.10826771653543307,0,0.004593175853018373,0.003937007874015748,0.015091863517060367,0,0.00853018372703412,0.04133858267716536,0,0,0.4507874015748031,0.0032808398950131233,0.022965879265091863,0.0006561679790026247,0.005249343832020997,0.03280839895013123,0.0026246719160104987,0.004593175853018373,0.011811023622047244,0.019028871391076115,0.004593175853018373,0.0688976377952756,0.005905511811023622,0.01706036745406824,0.007874015748031496,0.020341207349081365,0,0.0013123359580052493,0.01115485564304462,0.21719160104986876,0.0013123359580052493,0.0006561679790026247,0.03215223097112861,0.07217847769028872,0.04002624671916011,0.0688976377952756,0.031496062992125984,0.07414698162729659,0.1384514435695538,0.10170603674540682,0.02690288713910761,0.0013123359580052493,0.03280839895013123,0.13648293963254593,0.0013123359580052493,0.013779527559055118,0.007874015748031496,0.001968503937007874,0.005249343832020997,0,0.0006561679790026247,0.047900262467191604,0.16076115485564305,0.08070866141732283,0.0006561679790026247,0.025590551181102362,0.01115485564304462,0.03871391076115486,0.12270341207349081,0.1325459317585302,0.003937007874015748,0.028871391076115485,0.0006561679790026247,37.525,1,107.35,11,5,14.850000000000001,27.125,61.15,14.705,65.375,13,58.1,66.15,1,37.525,0,174.435,47.975,231.175,450.26000000000005,174.435,,0.5061984152054287,0.02659149397718167,0.7457139140997425,0.23106326069721805,0.12017494462146865,0.2885960235613283,0.42561697695779,0.6255369846581531,0.28658566407496844,0.6410507183725369,0.2620650176437244,0.6134774311879844,0.6437579633510294,0.02659149397718167,0.33751984359761494,0,0.09458265103618796,0.026013143483023003,0.12534837821131511,0.24414128159803936,-0.6867224294201483,0.7558587184019606,130

270,"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo The “revolving, rigged system” that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party’s candidate’s right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. “This was their ‘Rosa Parks’ moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy” -- but failed the test. Green Party’s Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo “ The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.” US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight’s disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. “When the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.” When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of “let her speak” could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: “I think it’s important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.” With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, …”I mean, you say you’re a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn't actually happen.” While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their “Rosa Parks” moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, “I know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can’t vote for the lesser of two evils. I’ve decided to vote for Jill Stein. I’m going to vote my conscience!” My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, “Don’t forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.“ Dr. Margaret Flowers of Green Party Interrupts Maryland Senate Televised Debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix98YXLWUJg Margaret Flowers Campaign Information: http://www.flowersforsenate.org Dr. Marsha Adebayo is the author of the Pulitzer Prize nominated: No FEAR: A Whistleblowers Triumph over Corruption and Retaliation at the EPA .

272,"Two men punched an Army veteran and stole his service dog outside his home in the Bronx before they fled the scene, police said.[  Police say a man punched Robert Lebron, 40, from behind and then chased after him while a second man grabbed Lebron’s service dog, Mala, from his porch at Valentine Ave. and E. 194th St. May 14, the New York Daily News reported. WABC reported that Lebron suffered minor injuries, but did not seek medical attention. Police say they identified one of the suspects as Brian Cohen, whom they say is the   of the victim’s wife, CBS New York reported. The Army veteran said he has the dog to help with his PTSD, NBC New York reported. Lebron says he has a special bond with his    service dog. “What she gives me I can’t get from someone else: not a therapist or a family member or my friend,” he said. “It’s unconditional love. ” Police have not identified the second suspect, but they say he was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and dark pants and shoes.

273,"Insurance Prices for Many Obamacare Customers Will Rise By Double Digits in 2017   The cost of private health insurance arranged under President Obama’s health care law will rise by double-digit percentages and many Americans will have only one insurer to choose from, the White House confirmed. The Associated Press reports : Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. “Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,” said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. … In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark “second-lowest cost silver plan” will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. The total number of insurers will drop from 232 this year to 167 in 2017, a loss of 28 percent. Switching will be a burden for patients with chronic conditions or other complications. While many carriers are offering a choice of plan designs, most use a single prescription formulary and physician network across all their products, explained Pearson. “So, enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,” she said. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed “an array of fixes, including sweetening the law’s subsidies and allowing more people to qualify for financial assistance,” AP reports. Americans will deliver profits to insurance companies either way, as subsidy money comes from taxpayers and represents a loss of public services Americans could otherwise provide themselves.",1,395,26.333333333333332,15,0.4,0,0,0,0,95.64553550104064,8.889042721518987,58.99415774099318,18.31987683886418,0.7873417721518987,0.017721518987341773,0.04556962025316456,0.02278481012658228,0.020253164556962026,0.005063291139240506,0.17215189873417722,0,0,0.005063291139240506,0.0810126582278481,0,0.06835443037974684,0.02278481012658228,0,0.020253164556962026,0.005063291139240506,0.09873417721518987,0.005063291139240506,0.07088607594936709,0.027848101265822784,0.05822784810126582,0.012658227848101266,0,0.03291139240506329,0.017721518987341773,0.05822784810126582,0,0.002531645569620253,0.002531645569620253,0.005063291139240506,0,0.043037974683544304,0.012658227848101266,0,0,0.389873417721519,0.02278481012658228,0.007594936708860759,0.005063291139240506,0,0.017721518987341773,0,0,0.010126582278481013,0.005063291139240506,0.002531645569620253,0.002531645569620253,0.04810126582278481,0.0379746835443038,0.002531645569620253,0.012658227848101266,0,0,0.060759493670886074,0.25063291139240507,0.017721518987341773,0,0.015189873417721518,0.04050632911392405,0.10379746835443038,0.017721518987341773,0.007594936708860759,0.035443037974683546,0.13670886075949368,0.035443037974683546,0.05569620253164557,0,0.020253164556962026,0.11139240506329114,0,0.002531645569620253,0.005063291139240506,0.010126582278481013,0.005063291139240506,0,0,0.007594936708860759,0.05822784810126582,0.04810126582278481,0,0.03291139240506329,0.010126582278481013,0.03291139240506329,0.11139240506329114,0.11139240506329114,0,0.07848101265822785,0,3.375,0,2,0,0,0,5.375,0,0,2,1,0,13,0,3.375,0,17.375,5.375,18,39.375,17.375,,0.16307886656644333,0,0.10351694645735657,0,0,0,0.23683100559258471,0,0,0.10351694645735657,0.054583639049126324,0,0.4287527098011759,0,0.4287527098011759,0,0.04172921044731312,0.0129090363254278,0.04323026118282798,0.09456619633743621,-0.04855331055421782,0.9054338036625638,18
274,"0 comments Megyn Kelly seems to think that she can get away with anything she says or does. Rupert Murdoch gave her a rude awakening when he told her that there are tons of other qualified people that would kill to take her spot. Rupert Murdoch is making Fox News’ salary negotiations with Megyn Kelly very public by granting an interview to one of the newspapers his company News Corp. owns, The Wall Street Journal. In the interview, Murdoch said that keeping Kelly is a priority, but that he has other hosts who could take over the program should she try and go to a rival network.‘[W]e have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for that spot,’ said Murdoch. Kelly, who is said to be making $15million this year, is reportedly looking to make more than $20million when she renegotiates her contract next July. She declined a request to comment on the story. Kelly’s star has continued to rise over the past year, and next month she will be releasing her first book, Settle For More. It has also been revealed that Kelly will be appearing Live With Kelly! the day after the election, marking the first time she is set to appear on Ripa’s morning show as a co-host. Her popularity is one of the main reasons Murdoch says he wants to get her contract signer ‘very soon.’ He added however that whether or not Kelly stays at the network is ‘up to her.’ It is unclear where Kelly might land if she does not stay with Fox News, but CNN seems like a very likely possibility for the popular host. Kelly also has a huge fan in CNN head honcho Jeff Zucker, who called her a ‘tremendous anchor’ earlier this year. And former CNN president Jon Klein applauded Kelly for not backing down to Donald Trump in the first Republican debate when she questioned him about his treatment of women, this despite the fact that her then boss Roger Ailes was a supporter of the Republican nominee.‘To be able to stand up and ask tough questions to your boss’s choice of president shows a certain steeliness,’ said Klein. The article also points out that Kelly also separated herself from other Fox News anchors during the internal investigation into Ailes’ alleged sexual harrassment by speaking with the lawyers hired to look into the claims being made by former host Gretchen Carlson. That revelation about Kelly’s speaking with investigators was confirmed by people who were familiar with the matter. Some have said that Kelly is set to be the center of Fox News after the exit of Ailes, but Murdoch shot down those claims saying: ‘We’re not changing direction … that would be business suicide.’ Murdoch also said that he wants to make sure Bill O’Reilly also resigns with the network when his contract is up next month. One rival news executive told Vanity Fair in August that the rivalry between Kelly and O’Reilly has devolved to the point that one of them will likely leave when their contracts expire. O’Reilly shot down reports of a feud between himself and Kelly in June however, telling The Hollywood Reporter: ‘Oh, that’s all fabricated. She’s in a totally different part of the building. The last time I saw Megyn Kelly was in Detroit in March [at the Fox News GOP debate].’ Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Fox News said: ‘[Fox News President] Bill Shine and [Executive Vice President, Programming & Development] Suzanne Scott have maintained a close relationship with Bill and Megyn for years and have helped both of them in many instances, all while co-existing under the same roof.’ Kelly has previously hinted that she would be willing to leave the network where she has worked for the last 12 years ‘There’s a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life,’ Kelly said in an interview with Variety earlier this year.‘I also have three kids who are soon going to be school from 8am to 3pm I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children.’ Kelly says she’s thought about hosting her own talk show but isn’t sure ‘what the market looks like for that in 2016’ and just doesn’t think ‘that’s the perfect thing for me’. As for co-hosting a morning show like Today, Kelly said she’s tried that before and she’s not much of a morning person.‘You have to wake up so early. The alarm goes off at 3:30am,’ said Kelly.‘When I did America’s Newsroom, which started at 9am, I remember saying to the makeup artist at the time, “If you could only know the afternoon me, you’d like me so much better.'” She then added: ‘Listen, this is a fickle business. What if they called me and fired me tomorrow? I have to keep my options open.’ Everybody is replaceable, even you Megyn!!

276,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Iran Sending Elite IRGC Warfighters Into Europe And United States In Preparation For Battle Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. by Geoffrey Grider November 2, 2016 The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, the country’s elite military force, is sending assets to infiltrate the United States and Europe at the direction of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to recent Farsi-language comments from an Iranian military leader. EDITOR’S NOTE: This is just a small bit of what our next president will have to deal with. Do you want a president who needs to take naps all the time , or do you want a Commander in Chief who is awake, alert and highly energized to get the job done? It’s a no-brainer, people, go out and vote to #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. The IRGC “will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,” according to the Iranian military commander, who said that these forces would operate with the goal of bolstering Iran’s hardline regime and thwarting potential plots against the Islamic Republic. “The whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,” Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran’s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was quoted as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC. Iran’s secret army, the IRGC: The military leader’s comments come as Iran is spending great amounts of money to upgrade its military hardware and bolster its presence throughout the Middle East and beyond. Iran intends to spend billions to purchase U.S.-made planes that are likely to be converted for use in its air force. Congressional leaders and others suspect that Iran has used a large portion of the cash windfall it received as a result of last summer’s nuclear agreement to upgrade its fighting capabilities war machine. “The IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republic,” Abnoush was quoted as saying. “The Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iran’s Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.” Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. Iran accuses the U.S. of violating its end of the agreement by not helping the Islamic Republic gain further access to international banks and other markets. Iran’s frustration over this has led to further accusations about a U.S. plot to foster unrest in the country. Iran IRGC UAV & UCAV operation units in Persian Gulf: “Our enemies have several projects to destroy our Islamic revolution, and have waged three wars against us to execute their plans against our Islamic Republic,” Abnoush said. “The IRGC has defeated enemies in several fronts. The enemy surrendered and accepted to negotiate with us.” “And now all of our problems are being solved and our country is becoming stronger in all fronts. Some believe the holy defense ended,” the military leader added. “They are wrong; the holy defense continues, and today, it is more complicated than before.” Congressional sources and experts involved in tracking Iran’s increased aggression in the region and elsewhere told the Washington Free Beacon that these most recent comments are troubling given Iran’s very public efforts to assassinate political enemies and others across the globe. “If we look at Iran’s previous terror attacks and assassination campaign around the world, such a statement is alarming,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Free Beacon . “The Islamic Republic has killed hundreds of Iranians and non-Iranians around the world in a coordinated campaign of terror. Iran may decide to restart the project now that many western companies are going to Iran and Iran feels its action in Europe may not be punished strongly.” Another source who advises congressional leaders on Iran sanctions issues told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration is blocking Congress from taking action to stop this type of infiltration by Iranian forces. “Iran is ideologically, politically, and militarily committed to exporting the Islamic revolution through terrorism, which is why even the Obama administration says they’re the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” the source said. “Congress wants to act, but Obama officials keep saying that new laws are unnecessary because the U.S. has enough tools to block Iranian terror expansion. Instead of using those tools, though, they’re sending Iran billions of dollars in cash while Iran plants terror cells in Europe and here at home.” source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

278,"On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox New Sunday,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward said the unverified dossier about   Donald Trump and Russia is a “garbage document. ”  Woodward said, “I think what is under reported here is Trump’s point of view on it. You laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited agent of the Russians, and a useful fool, they started this in Trump’s mind, He knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. No one came out and said those people shouldn’t be saying those things, So act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. ” “I’ve lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations, that is a garbage document,” he continued. “It never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump’s incoming White House counsel. So Trump’s right to be upset about that. I  think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we had, who are terrific and have done great work. I think they made a mistake here. And when people mistakes, they should apologize. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,233,19.416666666666668,12,0.24034334763948498,0,0,0,0,48.54506437768241,11.307389677561353,87.66935271962862,33.16400980993256,0.8111587982832618,0.008583690987124463,0.04291845493562232,0.055793991416309016,0.04721030042918455,0.008583690987124463,0.1888412017167382,0.004291845493562232,0.004291845493562232,0.030042918454935622,0.07296137339055794,0,0.09012875536480687,0.004291845493562232,0,0.008583690987124463,0.008583690987124463,0.06437768240343347,0,0.06437768240343347,0.017167381974248927,0.06437768240343347,0,0,0.008583690987124463,0.02575107296137339,0.04721030042918455,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06437768240343347,0,0,0.5021459227467812,0.004291845493562232,0.02145922746781116,0.008583690987124463,0.017167381974248927,0.09871244635193133,0.004291845493562232,0,0.017167381974248927,0.030042918454935622,0.012875536480686695,0.02145922746781116,0,0.012875536480686695,0.012875536480686695,0.02145922746781116,0.004291845493562232,0,0.017167381974248927,0.2703862660944206,0.004291845493562232,0,0.03862660944206009,0.04721030042918455,0.04721030042918455,0.06437768240343347,0.02575107296137339,0.02575107296137339,0.09871244635193133,0.1630901287553648,0.004291845493562232,0,0.04291845493562232,0.13304721030042918,0,0.012875536480686695,0,0,0.017167381974248927,0,0,0.012875536480686695,0.13304721030042918,0.060085836909871244,0,0.004291845493562232,0.012875536480686695,0.060085836909871244,0.1630901287553648,0.1759656652360515,0.004291845493562232,0.02575107296137339,0.017167381974248927,21,0,8,0,0,0,0,20,0,14,3,1,4,0,21,0,24,0,40,63,24,,0.5754696463610796,0,0.3405424265831667,0,0,0,0,0.5635083268962916,0,0.47470607699125783,0.16223290110168398,0.060635704539036266,0.20521309615767264,0,0.3405424265831667,0,0.08759124087591241,0,0.145985401459854,0.22992700729927007,-0.5935939823407855,0.7700729927007299,22
279,"Two years ago, it seemed almost impossible that Tracy Morgan would ever perform comedy again: On June 7, 2014, he was critically injured in a car crash when a   struck the back of a luxury van he was traveling in. A fellow passenger, James McNair (known as Jimmy Mack) was killed three other passengers were injured and Mr. Morgan was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital. A monthslong recovery process followed. Incredibly, just over a year later, Mr. Morgan was back at “Saturday Night Live,” the NBC sketch comedy series where he broke through as a cast member in the late 1990s, hosting its broadcast of Oct. 17, 2015. He revisited popular “S. N. L. ” characters he had performed in the past and reunited with his “30 Rock”   Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer and Tina Fey, the “30 Rock” creator and “S. N. L. ” alumna. On Thursday, Mr. Morgan received an Emmy Award nomination as an outstanding guest actor in a comedy series for the “Saturday Night Live” episode he hosted. In a phone interview, he spoke candidly and emotionally about his road to this moment. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.  How are you feeling today? Kind of emotional. Very thankful. Just overwhelmed. I’ve been crying all morning. Because when I got the word, my whole last two years  —   my whole life, really  —   just flashed right before me. It just brought to mind what my family went through, what the doctors went through, what my fans went through. What Jimmy Mack’s family went through. What everybody went through. It’s been difficult. It’s still overwhelming to me. I’m trying to fight it right now. Win or lose, this one is for Jimmy Mack. This one is for my boy.  What was it like to be asked to come back to host “Saturday Night Live”? It wasn’t even like that. For many years, Lorne Michaels is like a dad to me. That’s just the way our relationship is. The minute it happened, Lorne called my wife a million times to see what was going on. He’s always been there for me. I remember being in my car one day, talking to Lorne Michaels on the phone, and I just broke down and I said, “Lorne, I want to come home. ” And he said to me, “The door’s always open. ” And a week later, I got the call: You’re hosting on Oct. 17. I love Lorne Michaels like I love my daddy. He’s always taken care of me.  Were you anxious on the night of your show? It felt like the first day I was ever there. I was nervous. When you’re doing the dress rehearsal, there’s a wardrobe person  —   her name is Donna  —   she pulls you from set to set, because you have to change. So I started to get in my own head, and thinking that the audience was looking at me like I was crippled or something was wrong with me. In between dress and air, I spoke to Lorne. I said: “Lorne, I don’t know if I can do this. It seems like the audience is feeling sorry for me. ” He said, “Tracy, they don’t care about the funny  —   they’re just happy you’re here. ” [chokes up] In that moment, I shed my tears, and I said, I’m going to let go. This young cast is giving me 100 percent, and I’m going to give them 150. And we had fun. You’ve continued to perform   comedy in clubs and theaters. How has that been going? I just want to spread my love. God gave me a tool to do it  —   it’s called a sense of humor. You go down to earth, and you spread your love with your comedy. Now I’m going hard, giving them everything I got, every show. The world that we live in today, we need it. We stop being angry and hateful and just laugh together. Is there rehabilitation work that you continue to do? Every day. I just got out of the gym with my therapist just now, five minutes ago. Working on my legs. But more than that, it’s my emotions. I realized, and I told my wife, “Baby, that wreck made me an emotional wreck. ” I had to deal with that. People don’t deal with things, and then they explode later. It manifests itself in other ways, like alcohol and drugs. No! I want to deal with it! My sense of humor is my way of dealing with things, so I had to get back onstage. People sometimes say it’s an honor just to be nominated  —   I imagine you know what that feels like now? You know, people don’t come back from an accident like that and host “Saturday Night Live” 14 months later. Most people that suffer the injuries we suffered are in vegetative states. I’m very happy to be alive to see my daughter and my sons grow up. I’m just happy to here.

280,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump has selected Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a conservative Republican member of the House and a fierce advocate of deep spending cuts, to be his budget director. “He’s a tremendous talent, especially when it comes to numbers and budgets,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mr. Mulvaney, 49, helped found the House Freedom Caucus, the group of conservative lawmakers who pushed for Speaker John A. Boehner to resign. As budget director, Mr. Mulvaney would help guide the  ’s promise of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a tax overhaul and a huge investment in the nation’s infrastructure. An early backer of Mr. Trump’s during the campaign, Mr. Mulvaney has taken a hard line on spending during President Obama’s term, vowing not to raise the nation’s debt limit and embracing the term “Shutdown Caucus” because of his willingness to shut the government down instead. Mr. Mulvaney was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, when he defeated John Spratt, a veteran Democratic congressman who had been chairman of the House Budget Committee. He won by branding his opponent a   liberal, unconcerned about fiscal prudence. Once on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mulvaney joined a conservative bloc that pressed for slashing federal spending more deeply than House Republican leaders preferred, and became a prominent face of the   movement on Capitol Hill. He was one of several dozen House Republicans who refused to back the deal to raise the statutory debt limit. Mr. Mulvaney has repeatedly opposed some of his own party’s budget proposals, and quickly established himself as one of the most outspoken members of that 2010 class of Republicans. By 2013, at the outset of his second term, he declined to support Mr. Boehner’s   as speaker, abstaining from the vote in protest. Strongly   Mr. Mulvaney, who has a degree in international economics from Georgetown and a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, chafed as much at the Republican leadership in the House as he did at Mr. Obama’s direction from the White House. If confirmed by the Senate to run the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Mulvaney will be responsible for helping to shepherd the president’s spending requests through a   Congress.",0,380,25.333333333333332,15,0.36578947368421055,0,0,0,0,99,2.2614339316499343,82.15519568151147,60.69433198380567,0.75,0.015789473684210527,0.03684210526315789,0.015789473684210527,0.034210526315789476,0.018421052631578946,0.17105263157894737,0.002631578947368421,0,0.02631578947368421,0.11052631578947368,0,0.03684210526315789,0.005263157894736842,0.002631578947368421,0.002631578947368421,0.005263157894736842,0.03684210526315789,0,0.060526315789473685,0.021052631578947368,0.04473684210526316,0,0,0.010526315789473684,0.007894736842105263,0.12631578947368421,0,0,0.005263157894736842,0,0,0.002631578947368421,0.034210526315789476,0,0,0.4026315789473684,0,0.007894736842105263,0.018421052631578946,0,0.018421052631578946,0,0.002631578947368421,0.010526315789473684,0.015789473684210527,0.005263157894736842,0.06315789473684211,0.042105263157894736,0.015789473684210527,0.002631578947368421,0.007894736842105263,0,0,0.02368421052631579,0.16842105263157894,0.002631578947368421,0,0.015789473684210527,0.07105263157894737,0.11578947368421053,0.031578947368421054,0.02631578947368421,0.09736842105263158,0.16578947368421051,0.05,0.015789473684210527,0,0.010526315789473684,0.10789473684210527,0.002631578947368421,0.005263157894736842,0.002631578947368421,0.002631578947368421,0.002631578947368421,0,0,0.031578947368421054,0.10526315789473684,0.06578947368421052,0,0.007894736842105263,0,0.031578947368421054,0.06578947368421052,0.08421052631578947,0,0.05526315789473684,0,10,0,22.5,0,1,0,6,1,5.83,11,16,7,7,0,10,0,42.83,8,38.5,84.33,42.83,,0.36602540378443865,0,0.5650354826521338,0,0.054583639049126324,0,0.2572842744474721,0.054583639049126324,0.2518303261828756,0.38841111079651675,0.4801847547959174,0.2878229343817586,0.2878229343817586,0,0.2572842744474721,0,0.098839221840168,0.01846168047446519,0.08884683728336372,0.19460918930145618,0.2611982141959633,0.8053908106985438,31
281,"Donald Trump, el primer presidente naranja de los Estados Unidos EL MAGNATE ASEGURA QUE SEGUIRÁ LUCHANDO POR LA IGUALDAD DE LA COMUNIDAD NARANJOAMERICANA racismo Donald Trump hizo historia el martes al convertirse en el primer presidente naranja de Estados Unidos, con una rotunda victoria sobre Hillary Clinton impulsada por un mensaje de renovación política y social. El candidato republicano, de 70 años, hijo de una mujer blanca de Kansas y de un padre naranja del Condado de Orange (California), prometió una nueva era de cambio y esperanza. Muchos de sus partidarios, como el reverendo naranja Jack Jessenson, dejaron caer lágrimas de color zanahoria por sus mejillas melocotonadas. Trump cruzó una puerta abierta hace 153 años, cuando Abraham Lincoln concedió la libertad a los esclavos naranjas en medio de una sangrienta guerra civil. El magnate asumirá la presidencia el 20 de enero, 51 años después de que se sancionara una ley que impedía votar a la población naranjoamericana en muchos estados sureños. El 45º presidente estadounidense ha afirmado que luchará por los derechos de los ciudadanos naranjas. “Racismo, no nos hemos curado de ello”, dijo en un programa de radio. “Aún es común escuchar en la calle expresiones ‘orangger’ (‘naranjucho’, en español) con total impunidad”, constató. Trump admite que ha habido cierto progreso en temas raciales, si comparamos la situación a la vivida por la comunidad naranja en la década de los 50 y los 60. En su libro “Dreams of my orange father”, el magnate ya trató el tema del antinaranjismo. “Me crié en un barrio eminentemente naranjoamericano. Un barrio calabaza, que le dicen los políticamente correctos. Los blancos no solían venir, y cuando lo hacían era para insultarnos diciendo ‘aquí huele a caqui’”, escribía en el prólogo, donde también aprovechó para desmentir el rumor de su pertenencia al grupo violento Orange Panthers. La fecha de investidura de Trump, programada para el 20 de enero, no es casual. Ese mismo día se conmemoran 50 años exactos desde que la policía cargara contra unos manifestantes naranjas con gran virulencia, episodio que pasó a la historia como el Carrot Sunday (Domingo zanahorio).",1,350,23.333333333333332,15,0.42,0,0,0,0,93.25858951175407,1,51.142857142857146,41.25274725274725,0.15714285714285714,0.002857142857142857,0.011428571428571429,0,0.017142857142857144,0.002857142857142857,0.15428571428571428,0.002857142857142857,0,0.008571428571428572,0.014285714285714285,0,0,0,0,0,0.011428571428571429,0.011428571428571429,0,0.06285714285714286,0.002857142857142857,0,0,0,0,0,0.02,0,0.002857142857142857,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03428571428571429,0,0.002857142857142857,0,0.005714285714285714,0,0.008571428571428572,0,0,0,0.008571428571428572,0.002857142857142857,0.002857142857142857,0,0.008571428571428572,0.002857142857142857,0.008571428571428572,0,0.025714285714285714,0.04,0,0.008571428571428572,0.017142857142857144,0.04285714285714286,0.03142857142857143,0.008571428571428572,0.011428571428571429,0.017142857142857144,0.002857142857142857,0.008571428571428572,0.002857142857142857,0,0.03142857142857143,0.014285714285714285,0,0.002857142857142857,0,0,0.014285714285714285,0,0,0,0.014285714285714285,0,0,0,0,0.014285714285714285,0,0,0,0.022857142857142857,0.002857142857142857,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,4,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.83,5,8,16.83,3.83,,0,0.10351694645735657,0,0,0,0,0.22400923773979586,0.1876127897984334,0.09555882239610927,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.010643915182169358,0.013895450629463913,0.022232721007142263,0.04677208681877553,-0.25399805247848234,0.9532279131812245,7
282,"Why Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch Plead The Fifth? Barracuda Brigade 2016-10-28 Print The administration is blocking congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course she needs to plead the 5th. She either can’t recall, refuses to answer, or just plain deflects the question. Straight up corruption at its finest! 100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to Iran…Corrupt to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch’s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney general’s office is “unacceptable” and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to “essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

284,"It is an idea universally indulged that escaping to a   spot, preferably surrounded by landscapes of stunning natural beauty, will spark bouts of unnatural creativity. Four years ago, I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales. It felt like another world. The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses. Our nearest neighbor was a farm a   walk across three fields. We couldn’t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper. I found that, true enough, with no job, no friends and no television, a lot of writing is possible. I never stopped to consider the cost. Social interaction was so rare that after weeks alone in my writing shed, my ability to regulate conversation atrophied: A friendly question in the post office would elicit a   response. I began to fear the prospect of friends visiting as a threat to my   “space. ” Then, after a year or more, just as the arrival of our first child transformed our isolation from a creative asset into a psychological liability, Rachel, our midwife, came with news. “Oh, there’s another author round here whose baby I just delivered. ” Loneliness and prideful smugness did battle: An unspoken obligation loomed. The author in question turned out to be Owen Sheers. In due course, we admitted to each other the drawbacks of our rural situation. Yes, with nothing but my wife and sheep for company, I had written a second book much faster than the first. But I did like talking about books as well as writing them. In the now popular saying, cities are where ideas go to have sex. So much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings, and, globally, the pace of urbanization is accelerating. Owen and I shared a latent fear: What were we missing out on? Owen knew several other writers in the area, the nonfiction writer Oliver Balch and the novelist Tom Bullough. I suggested a writers’ book club to discuss a different book every month from the perspective of craft, technique, style. “Yes, a few of us tried that before,” said Tom, wearily. “But someone said something unforgivable about Gogol, and that was the end of it. ” Before the first meeting, we went to a reading and met two more. They, in turn, spread the word further and the net wider. In these hills, writers, it seemed, were more common than vermin. And their enthusiasm for the book club was palpable. To taciturn writers for whom small talk is a kind of torture, it was, I think, a convenient alibi for company. British sociability can often be a perilous obstacle course of implicit obligation where the goal of social occasions is to emerge unscathed without being caught in a web of suffocating reciprocity. We were explicitly gathered not to talk about ourselves, but about books. Now each month we assemble like a clandestine congregation of nonconformists in the basement of a charming local pub: the Bridge End Inn, Talgarth. After several months, we quickly overwhelmed our allotted table and colonized the whole room. Our membership is now pushing 18. Ideas, it seems, are desperate for their monthly hookup. So what of the product? Do the magic ingredients of peace, quiet and stimulating company make any difference to creative output? It’s hard to say. The main factor, we’d all agree, is the cost of time. Money vaporizes in London before you’ve even put your hand in your pocket. But will we write different books outside the city? Maybe not immediately, but the constellation of serious writers in a rural setting is an interesting phenomenon that, I think, reflects wider changes in the global economy and climate. Artists are getting priced out of global cities, and climate change has politicized the rural in new ways. The first book we read was “10:04,” by Ben Lerner. Although the group on the whole reacted badly to the narrow New York focus of the book, the example of the author’s supreme   of place (it is taken as   that Brooklyn is where anyone would want to live) has struck a chord in many discussions since. Away from the city, climate change as a totalizing political and cultural concern is hard to avoid. “How can anyone, now, justify writing a book that is not, in some way, about our relationship to this planet,” our dear late member Rebecca Loncraine said. It would be difficult, here, to write one of those   nature books, with which Britain is currently awash, idealizing the natural world as a zone of innocence untouched by human influence. Lately, we have spent time talking, as all writers do, about the inadequacy of language of the need for a new vocabulary to describe things that humans have denatured, violated. The sea is no longer the same sea that the word initially signified. The air is no longer the air it once was, and so on. Pretentious perhaps, but urgent too. Strangely, I have met more writers in these hills than I ever knew in all the global cities in which I have lived: New York, Chicago, Nairobi, London. Not only has moving away from the city increased my productivity, but I am blessed with that rare thing: a fresh view. My citybound friends still refer to where I live as “the middle of nowhere,” but to me, it increasingly feels at the heart of things.",0,929,16.89090909090909,55,0.2960172228202368,0,0,0,0,89.8446283533474,57.75885291601115,69.35429801630018,27.560710441334766,0.8471474703982778,0.013993541442411194,0.07104413347685684,0.04090419806243272,0.04305705059203445,0.05059203444564048,0.17007534983853606,0.004305705059203444,0.007534983853606028,0.007534983853606028,0.09472551130247578,0.0032292787944025836,0.06350914962325081,0.008611410118406888,0.002152852529601722,0.02045209903121636,0.011840688912809472,0.1054897739504844,0.007534983853606028,0.07965554359526372,0.04090419806243272,0.04951560818083961,0,0,0.02906350914962325,0.011840688912809472,0.08503767491926803,0,0.0032292787944025836,0.006458557588805167,0.002152852529601722,0,0.004305705059203444,0.04413347685683531,0.006458557588805167,0.006458557588805167,0.4940796555435953,0.0032292787944025836,0.007534983853606028,0.0032292787944025836,0.02691065662002153,0.04843918191603875,0.005382131324004306,0.002152852529601722,0.022604951560818085,0.013993541442411194,0.02045209903121636,0,0.006458557588805167,0.022604951560818085,0.015069967707212056,0.02045209903121636,0,0.002152852529601722,0.011840688912809472,0.24542518837459634,0,0.001076426264800861,0.022604951560818085,0.05489773950484392,0.06673842841765339,0.060279870828848225,0.021528525296017224,0.010764262648008612,0.15177610333692143,0.10871905274488698,0.02583423035522067,0.004305705059203444,0.015069967707212056,0.155005382131324,0.001076426264800861,0.005382131324004306,0.007534983853606028,0.006458557588805167,0.007534983853606028,0,0.001076426264800861,0,0.09472551130247578,0.07965554359526372,0,0.0193756727664155,0.006458557588805167,0.0527448869752422,0.11517761033369214,0.12594187298170076,0.023681377825618945,0.04843918191603875,0.0032292787944025836,50,0,37.375,2,15,18,15,19,18,62.2,9,13.3,30,0,50,1,124.3,38,133.2,279.5,124.3,,0.6012054320159287,0,0.5298318517287951,0.0568727151524708,0.31142139263235424,0.3517944101339845,0.31142139263235424,0.3642201761400892,0.3517944101339845,0.6522223676337171,0.2134408548890932,0.28622926532836623,0.47493718553309977,0,0.5204850789390615,0.029268651413606912,0.11113097898971837,0.033974072418417524,0.11908806437192668,0.24988824318283415,-0.27509824191708093,0.7501117568171658,90
285,"October 28, 2016 Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement. Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela’s socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. “Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?” said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. “We are sick of this. It’s time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,” added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad.",1,207,23,9,0.391304347826087,0,0,0,0,97.5694818431687,48.486312399355874,84.487922705314,1.8335464620630852,0.7632850241545893,0.004830917874396135,0.05314009661835749,0.01932367149758454,0.04830917874396135,0.028985507246376812,0.13526570048309178,0.00966183574879227,0.00966183574879227,0.014492753623188406,0.07729468599033816,0,0.05314009661835749,0.00966183574879227,0,0,0.004830917874396135,0.05314009661835749,0,0.05314009661835749,0.01932367149758454,0.033816425120772944,0.004830917874396135,0,0.014492753623188406,0.00966183574879227,0.11594202898550725,0,0.004830917874396135,0,0.004830917874396135,0,0.004830917874396135,0.03864734299516908,0,0,0.3961352657004831,0.00966183574879227,0.004830917874396135,0.004830917874396135,0,0.043478260869565216,0.004830917874396135,0,0.01932367149758454,0.01932367149758454,0.00966183574879227,0.004830917874396135,0.004830917874396135,0.024154589371980676,0,0.03864734299516908,0.004830917874396135,0,0.03864734299516908,0.21739130434782608,0,0,0.014492753623188406,0.03864734299516908,0.04830917874396135,0.024154589371980676,0.00966183574879227,0.04830917874396135,0.1642512077294686,0.06763285024154589,0.00966183574879227,0.004830917874396135,0.01932367149758454,0.18357487922705315,0,0.00966183574879227,0.028985507246376812,0,0.004830917874396135,0,0,0,0.10628019323671498,0.0966183574879227,0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.06763285024154589,0.10628019323671498,0.0966183574879227,0.00966183574879227,0.033816425120772944,0,3,0,26.75,0,4,10,3,7,2,53,0,5,9,0,3,0,16,13,82.75,106.75,16,,0.1827439976315568,0,0.665979394769581,0,0.22966848451216434,0.42705098312484224,0.1827439976315568,0.3428614889693982,0.12973190755680383,0.7979955812685685,0,0.2714970279031851,0.40149162409079436,0,0,0,0.05465414175918019,0.0444064901793339,0.28266438941076005,0.36464560204953034,-0.8755610298904853,0.6353543979504697,21
286,"8. Emigre Super Blocs Part VIII:The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016 . “The purpose of “ Inform and Influence Operations ” is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences “think and act” in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine .” W hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world. ” What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please don’t forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversary’s leader who is the ultimate target.” – Joel Harding IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent’s decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton. “ Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function.” The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the who’s who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. It’s also why big media carries the same line or themes. The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrong’s background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton’s message out. ” All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins — and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.” According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundation’s Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article “Families Valued,” focused on “juggler families” as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council’s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. According to journalist Robert Parry “The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe “This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.” Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is “Are you willing to go to war with Russia?” Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. While the rest of the BBG board support Clinton’s proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clinton’s first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, don’t they? As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, it’s no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you can’t tell me. The odds are you haven’t heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. “Unity to act when required has been the diaspora’s mantra – this cannot be disputed . As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN – (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi – are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.” The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930’s they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live…One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons…- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta – Pers Anders Rudling With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. “ OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000’s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.” “I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . The Ukrainian issue “trumps” all other personal issues! A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused.” Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference Hillary Clinton’s response is she will defend Ukraine’s borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaign’s program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S”. “ We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence.” Joel Harding By systematically and continually attacking the voter’s psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term “anti-western” refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren’t carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. “I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ‘inform and influence activities’. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations – of all sorts – against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel_harding@” If you don’t think this is possible , this has been going on around you for a long time. look at the credentials of retired Brigadier General Joel Harding and decide for yourself. But first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him. “ Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about a competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm. It is our job to maximize your advantages over your competitor while minimizing your competitor. We work on the national level down to the individual level. We seek to give you every advantage possible in order to advance your position, increase your reputation, and maximize your standing in your field.” “ Bio- Joel Harding spent 26 years in the Army ; his first nine years were spent as an enlisted soldier, mostly in Special Forces, as an SF qualified communicator and medic, on an A-Team. After completing his degree, Joel then received his commission as an Infantry Officer and after four years transitioned to the Military Intelligence Corps.

Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? As a litmus test take Hillary’s name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCain’s name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add what’s been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. “ I’ve seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. I’ve seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. It’s unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I won’t continue to be until the good Lord takes me.” Cesar Vargas Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I can’t help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. If all these things weren’t being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win. Your voice, your views, your informed choice will no longer matter. The IIO practitioner kills dissent. That’s their job. They’re only doing their job. GH Eliason Mr. Eliason l ives in Ukraine.

287,"Here’s what we learned after the ugliest presidential campaign in modern times. The voters you blame, whose ballots  —   for Clinton or Trump  —   so mystify and offend you, are not a distant, unfamiliar America. They are sitting across the dinner table, or the office cubicle, or the bed. They are your parents, your siblings, your friends. Who wants to have that tough conversation, about why they voted as they did and about how it makes you feel? Just about nobody. So we avoid it. But like it or not, these people are in your life. The holidays are upon us. And deep down, you may actually want to have this talk. You may need to have this talk. So we put together a guide for how to do it. We consulted with a professional: Liz Joyner, the executive director of The Village Square, an organization that facilitates these kinds of intimate, difficult conversations. The ground rules: Do it over a meal or drink. (Dine by Skype if the distance requires it.) Don’t jump right into politics  —   just catch up first. Offer the benefit of the doubt. Assume the other person has generally good intentions. Almost everyone does. Don’t let imperfect word choices tank the conversation. Forget policy debates for now. Just listen to the answers to your questions. Your turn is next. Talk again soon. Promise. The questions: We brought together pairs of family and friends  —   one Trump voter, one Clinton voter per pair  —   and had them use this guide to facilitate conversation. You can listen to the first conversation below, and subscribe to The   on iTunes or Google Play Music to follow along as we release new episodes next week.",0,283,10.481481481481481,27,0.26855123674911663,0,0,0,0,60.25690210849221,35.23404440954501,96.12141886382169,20.425598743619943,0.8939929328621908,0.007067137809187279,0.045936395759717315,0.06713780918727916,0.04240282685512368,0.06713780918727916,0.19081272084805653,0.01060070671378092,0.007067137809187279,0.01060070671378092,0.0812720848056537,0,0.07420494699646643,0.0176678445229682,0,0.02120141342756184,0.007067137809187279,0.127208480565371,0.01060070671378092,0.053003533568904596,0.0176678445229682,0.07420494699646643,0,0,0.045936395759717315,0.014134275618374558,0.13074204946996468,0,0.01060070671378092,0.0035335689045936395,0,0,0.014134275618374558,0.0176678445229682,0.007067137809187279,0.007067137809187279,0.5512367491166078,0.0035335689045936395,0.01060070671378092,0.007067137809187279,0,0.06713780918727916,0,0.014134275618374558,0.024734982332155476,0.02120141342756184,0.02120141342756184,0,0,0.02120141342756184,0.0176678445229682,0.02120141342756184,0,0,0.014134275618374558,0.2226148409893993,0.0176678445229682,0.0035335689045936395,0.0176678445229682,0.09187279151943463,0.06713780918727916,0.08480565371024736,0.0176678445229682,0.038869257950530034,0.13074204946996468,0.1519434628975265,0,0.0035335689045936395,0,0.13074204946996468,0,0.007067137809187279,0.01060070671378092,0,0.0035335689045936395,0,0,0,0.17314487632508835,0.06713780918727916,0,0.053003533568904596,0.0176678445229682,0.04240282685512368,0.14487632508833923,0.13780918727915195,0.024734982332155476,0.04240282685512368,0.04240282685512368,9.725,0,4,0,0,0,13.5,20.25,1,13.175,4.725,5,14.175,0,9.725,0,26.175,15.5,41.425,83.1,26.175,,0.29502865273415446,0,0.14685419906293512,0,0,0,0.3674679274431887,0.4656467652848573,0.0412576995867245,0.36182232044278856,0.16897388993801415,0.17706699104120877,0.37888001119222525,0,0.14685419906293512,0,0.07562843108928055,0.04478474429355677,0.11969084079745737,0.24010401618029467,-0.48135078620670435,0.7598959838197054,20
288,"at 11:54 am 4 Comments When it comes to the Clintons, where there’s smoke, there’s usually a structure fire. I doubt Haiti is any different. With that in mind, I wanted to flag an article published earlier today at the BBC , What really happened with the Clintons in Haiti? Here are some excerpts: Donald Trump has said the work of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Haiti was a “disgrace”. What really happened? “The Clinton family, they are crooks, they are thieves, they are liars,” says Haitian activist Dahoud Andre. He has been leading protests outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign base in Brooklyn for the last two years. He said protesters from his small activist group, the Committee to Mobilize Against Dictatorship in Haiti, will continue to level their allegations – so far all unproven – if the Democratic candidate wins the White House. Mrs Clinton retorted that she was proud of the foundation’s work, and pointed out her rival’s namesake charity had spent money on a lifesize portrait of himself. The Clintons’ history with the world’s first black republic dates back to their 1975 honeymoon, when they met a voodoo priest and visited a hotel where Ernest Hemingway once stayed. Mr Andre is not alone among his compatriots in blaming the once-and-perhaps-future first couple for a litany of ills in Haiti. Kim Ives, editor of Haiti Liberte newspaper, told the BBC: “A lot of Haitians are not big fans of the Clintons, that’s for sure.” “The fact the Clintons kind of took over things after the earthquake and did a pretty poor job of it translates to why the Haitians have a pretty dim view of them,” he added. So what happened? Mrs Clinton was Secretary of State and Mr Clinton was UN Special Envoy to Haiti when the January 2010 earthquake struck, killing an estimated 220,000 people. Some $13.3bn (£10.9bn) was pledged by international donors for Haiti’s recovery. Mr Clinton was appointed co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), along with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. But the IHRC found itself under fire as frustrations mounted at the slow pace of recovery. Its mandate was not renewed by the Haitian parliament in 2011. How about this graphic… A US Government Accountability Office report discovered no hint of wrongdoing, but concluded the IHRC’s decisions were “not necessarily aligned with Haitian priorities”. The GAO must have a peculiar definition of “wrongdoing.” Mr Clinton’s own office at the UN found 9% of the foreign aid cash went to the Haitian government and 0.6% to local organizations. The bulk of it went to UN agencies, international aid groups, private contractors and donor countries’ own civilian and military agencies. For example, the Pentagon billed the State Department hundreds of millions of dollars for sending US troops to hand out bottled water and keep order on the streets of Haiti’s ravaged capital, Port-au-Prince. Jake Johnston, an analyst with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonpartisan group that has studied the quake reconstruction, told the BBC “it’s hard to say it’s been anything other than a failure”. But he believes the State Department and IHRC simply replicated the mistakes of the whole foreign aid industry by chasing short-term gains instead of building longer-term capacity on the ground. “They relied too much on outside actors,” Mr Johnston says, “and supplanted the role of the Haitian government and domestic producers.” After the earthquake, disaster capitalists flocked to the nation of 10 million people, which is about the size of the US state of Massachusetts. Private contractors were eager to sell services, in what one US envoy described in a Wikileaks-disclosed diplomatic cable as a “gold rush”. In email exchanges with top Clinton Foundation officials, a senior aide to Mrs Clinton, who was then-secretary of state, kept an eye out for those identified by the abbreviations “FOB” (friends of Bill Clinton) or “WJC VIPs” (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). “Need you to flag when people are friends of WJC,” wrote Caitlin Klevorick, a senior State Department official who was vetting incoming offers of assistance coming through the Clinton Foundation. The emails, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Republican National Committee, have fuelled claims the Clintons were running a pay-to-play operation, though no hard evidence of this has emerged. House Republicans are already laying the groundwork for a volley of congressional hearings into the Clinton Foundation in the event the Democratic candidate wins the White House in a week’s time. Possibly the most enduring criticism of the Clinton Foundation’s work in Haiti stems from its signature project, a garment factory known as the Caracol Industrial Park. The foundation, working with the Clinton State Department, helped arrange a US-subsidised deal with the Haitian government to build the $300m factory complex in 2012. Several hundred farmers were evicted from their land to make way for the 600-acre manufacturing site, which produces clothes for retailers such as Old Navy, Walmart and Target. South Korean textile giant Sae-A Trading Co, which is the main employer at the facility, subsequently donated between $50,000 to $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Mr Clinton declared 100,000 jobs would be created “in short order”. But the Caracol Industrial Park has created only 8,000 jobs. In the Little Haiti neighbourhood of Miami that was visited by Mr Trump this September, the head of a local women’s advocacy group has questions for Mrs Clinton. Marleine Bastien, executive director of Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami, believes that Clinton-backed projects have helped global investors more than they have benefited poverty-stricken Haitians. She told the BBC: “The more Secretary Clinton refrains from responding to the concerns and questions from the people of Haiti, this perception that she’s trying to evade responding will continue. “Instead of allowing these questions to linger and fester, why not come clean? The questions will not go away, they will continue.” Come clean? This is the Clintons we’re talking about.

289,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —     Donald J. Trump has named Thomas P. Bossert, a top national security aide under President George W. Bush, to be his homeland security adviser, the Trump transition team announced Tuesday morning. Mr. Bossert will become assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position the transition team said would be equal in status to that of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be his national security adviser. The same position under President Obama has been a deputy national security adviser. The change in rank “reflects the unwavering commitment   Trump has to the safety and security of the nation, its people and territory,” the transition team said in a statement. “Mr. Bossert will focus on domestic and transnational security priorities as General Michael Flynn remains steadfastly focused on international security challenges,” it said. Officials on Mr. Obama’s national security team challenged the assertion that Mr. Bossert had been elevated to a higher position than his counterpart in the current administration, Lisa Monaco, who also has the title assistant to the president. A senior national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters relating to the incoming administration, noted that Ms. Monaco was the chairwoman of the Principals Committee of the Homeland Security Council, had a seat on the National Security Council and participated alongside the national security adviser during daily national security briefings for Mr. Obama. The new designation for Mr. Bossert may suggest a desire by the new administration to reconfigure the national security apparatus at the White House. Before Mr. Obama, the homeland security adviser oversaw a staff that was separate from the one run by the national security adviser. Mr. Obama combined those into a single, unified staff when he came into office. Mr. Trump may be thinking about splitting them again. In the statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Bossert “an invaluable asset” and praised the breadth of experience he would bring to the new administration. “He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity challenges,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser for Mr. Bush, and he runs a risk management consulting firm in Washington. He is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, working on the research institution’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative. Helping to protect the country from cybercrimes is likely to be a major focus for Mr. Bossert in light of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other incidents in recent years. Mr. Bossert will face the challenge of balancing cybersecurity needs against the privacy concerns of internet companies. “We must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles of liberty,” Mr. Bossert said in the statement announcing his appointment. News of Mr. Bossert’s selection drew praise from some members of Congress and former colleagues in the Bush administration, who described him as capable and knowledgeable about threats to the country. Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, also praised the choice. Mr. Langevin, a founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said Mr. Bossert had approached the issues of cyberthreats in a “centrist, bipartisan” manner. “I also hope that he will impress upon the   the vital national security concerns tied to Russian information warfare activities, and I encourage him to work closely with Congress in attempting to build our resilience and our defenses to forestall such operations in the future,” Mr. Langevin said in a statement. Frances F. Townsend, who was Mr. Bush’s homeland security adviser, said she was confident that Mr. Bossert would “continue to demonstrate the capacity and insight needed to take on the tough challenges facing the country. ” She focused in particular on Mr. Bossert’s expertise in another key part of the job: responding to natural disasters and other crises that require coordination among the White House, governors and other state officials. In a brief text message, Ms. Townsend called Mr. Bossert a “great pick” and recalled that he had helped lead the “  review” after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, helping to create more than 100 recommendations about how to better respond to such crises. “Tom knows the importance of   partnerships and most importantly how best to establish and strengthen them,” she said. Also on Tuesday, the transition team formally announced that Jason D. Greenblatt, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization and a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, would serve as his special representative for international negotiations. Mr. Greenblatt has been the  ’s business attorney for years, and in a statement, Mr. Trump called him “one of my closest and most trusted advisers. ” “He has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf, as well as the expertise to bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics,” Mr. Trump said. As the president’s special representative, Mr. Greenblatt is likely to focus on peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, renegotiating trade agreements and the relationship between the United States and Cuba, among other international issues.",0,879,22.53846153846154,39,0.40386803185437997,0,0,0,0,98.04138524010287,9.043173097317828,89.85773089254317,99,0.7724687144482366,0.034129692832764506,0.06598407281001138,0.017064846416382253,0.07622298065984073,0.01820250284414107,0.17974971558589306,0.0022753128555176336,0.0022753128555176336,0.007963594994311717,0.10580204778156997,0,0.04436860068259386,0.004550625711035267,0.0022753128555176336,0.007963594994311717,0.004550625711035267,0.06257110352673492,0.0011376564277588168,0.05802047781569966,0.027303754266211604,0.053469852104664393,0,0.0011376564277588168,0.011376564277588168,0.010238907849829351,0.16609783845278725,0,0,0,0.005688282138794084,0,0.009101251422070534,0.03640500568828214,0.0034129692832764505,0.0034129692832764505,0.4050056882821388,0.0022753128555176336,0.012514220705346985,0.0034129692832764505,0.004550625711035267,0.026166097838452786,0.0011376564277588168,0,0.02161547212741752,0.009101251422070534,0.007963594994311717,0.05460750853242321,0.007963594994311717,0.010238907849829351,0,0.005688282138794084,0,0.0011376564277588168,0.005688282138794084,0.16382252559726962,0.0011376564277588168,0,0.017064846416382253,0.08191126279863481,0.09328782707622298,0.03185437997724687,0.06825938566552901,0.08873720136518772,0.14675767918088736,0.05802047781569966,0.009101251422070534,0,0.02957906712172924,0.12400455062571103,0,0.009101251422070534,0.034129692832764506,0,0.0034129692832764505,0,0,0.02161547212741752,0.13993174061433447,0.08646188850967008,0,0.009101251422070534,0.0022753128555176336,0.02844141069397042,0.07849829351535836,0.08191126279863481,0.0034129692832764505,0.08304891922639362,0,54.514375,0,16.45,0,14,11,15,4,13.83,30,110,12,46.05,0,54.514375,0,238.394375,29,44.45,309.84437499999996,238.394375,,0.6612383200717225,0,0.37067515533546624,0,0.33390191990673007,0.28256947035343966,0.3494183807442671,0.12528000045831353,0.33119021504155105,0.5178799781155294,0.7975147694673881,0.3005373601422242,0.6224783199858873,0,0.23228018267026782,0,0.2173456694802305,0.026439484635183547,0.04052534800116927,0.2824870893831224,0.9075850083080468,0.7175129106168776,92

291,"By John Kaminski on October 30, 2016 John Kaminski — The Rebel.org Oct 24, 2016 Dark secrets remain unrevealed as society’s fabric disintegrates Why is every major politician surrounded by Jewish ‘advisers’? Too many things don’t make sense. What makes us act against our own best interests? Why are we Americans encircling Russia with tanks and missiles? Why do we create our own terrorists and bomb our own allies? Why do we blow up our own buildings and claim that the crime was done by terrorists who simply cannot be found? What do the misanthropes who operate the gears of power want by causing constant conflict? Sometimes Washington reminds me of the Old Testament, ruled by a wrathful God who orders us to kill those whose property we wish to steal. Why would we hire the most odious criminals in the world to butcher the inhabitants of Middle Eastern countries? I mean, whose work are we doing by these actions, covertly funding Israel-friendly Arab radicals to demolish nations who refuse to do our bidding? There can be only one answer. America is no longer run by Americans. Because the same people who commit the crimes own the newspapers and TV networks, most Americans don’t realize their country has long ago been taken away by the very international bankers Henry Ford warned us about, who Adolf Hitler warned us about. Now Ford and Hitler are the most widely reviled personalities from the 20th century. Not a day goes by when you don’t hear something nasty about them. They tried to stop the Jewish takeover of reality. The tidal wave of Jew-owned white noise media overwhelmed them. What most people still don’t realize is that none of these neocon wars would have happened had Hitler won World War II. He never wanted to conquer anyone. He only wanted the return of Germany’s ancestral lands, which had been stolen by the Jewish allies (US, Britain, USSR) after World War I. All the horror stories about Hitler are projected Jewish fantasies that have dominated the Western airwaves for a half century. They are meant to obscure Hitler’s economic miracle and the path to a financial future free of the vampire Jews. Hitler floated seven peace proposals prior to World War II. But because he had challenged the Jewish monopoly of control of the world’s financial affairs, the Jews would let him have no peace. The secret Jew Roosevelt pushed the levers of war. Winston Churchill started bombing the first day he took office. Think of all the wars that have been spawned by the Jewish murder machine since that time, the 1940s. It’s impossible to say that none of them would have happened, but had Hitler won, the Jews would not now be strutting around the world using U.S. military might as its brutal enforcer to rob all nations of the their most valuable possessions, and even more chilling, to stamp out all traces of opposition to their psychopathological hijacking of everyone’s reality. You can’t live a normal life because of the Jews, harvesting and neutering everything they encounter, like some robot parasite destined to suck the life out of the world, as Hitler and Ford both warned us about, turning your food into poison and your daughters into tramps. There is no one to turn to for help. Turn to the wrong person and you can get killed. Call the cops and your pet’s as good as dead. Anywhere in the white United States, if you saw a woman being raped by 20 men on the street, everyone’s first impulse would be to stop the crime, or at least report it to the cops. Not so in the ugly deserts of the Middle East, where insane Arab terrorists hired by Jews and Americans commit the most barbaric crimes in order to blame these false flag atrocities on people it means to exterminate, a task for which any excuse will do for these world famous killers. This is the real American personality, the goons who hired those al-Qaeda mercenaries to rape and kill Qaddafi in the streets, people like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Stone cold killers. And they laugh about it. If you were in your right mind, you wouldn’t ever trust people like this. America gassed those hundreds of children in Syria and tried to blame it on Assad. People finally began to realize that nothing the U.S. government ever says is true. The terrorists who supposedly slit people’s throats are so over-the-top because they are all a Hollywood act < http://www.globalresearch.ca/isis-beheadings-of-journalists-cia-admitted-to-staging-fake-jihadist-videos-in-2010/5399345 >. Americans have begun to realize that they are the killers they thought they had been fighting. It turns out the fight has just begun. Unglued. Society is becoming unglued. The fabric of society is disintegrating. What horrific chaos is sure to follow can only be envisioned by our most harrowing nightmares. There are no explanations that adequately describe what exactly is happening to the world at the present time except to note that things that once seemed to work now no longer do. It seems like freedom has been devalued and shackled, and governments make too many decisions the people never wanted, like the World Wars, the Great Depression and the War on Drugs. To be an American today is like living in a grand old steamship that is not so slowly sinking into a jellified ocean, petrified minds in a viscous sea of misinformation, afraid to challenge orders they know are lies, sliding into oblivion without a clue that they are doing so. The separation of the population into chosen and neglected applies to all religions, guaranteeing perpetual sectarian strife. Those who are chosen believe it is their right to rob and kill whomever they choose, that they are simply following the laws of nature and the personalized deity they choose to hallucinate. Governments have adopted this policy. Peace is achieved when robbers agree to divide the spoils. The rest of the people are left to scramble for scraps. It has always been this way, I think. The government overreach to extend help to needy immigrants is really part of a ploy to dilute the American electorate into undereducated slaves who will support the government through any atrocity because it is the government that is keeping them alive. This is how the Democrats guarantee themselves a majority of citizens too grateful for the financial help to ever quarrel with the government’s expansionist objectives and its continuing restrictions on individual rights. There are simply too many subjects to be addressed, to be worried about. They swathe all the final cuts of vegetables, right before it goes to market, with Glyphosate, to make sure everyone gets poisoned. Step in brackish Louisiana water with a cut on your foot and your body will completely disintegrate in a few weeks. The fallacy of the cloister regiments us into soldier slaves, causing us to murder those who disagree with what we say. The more technology increases the faster human abilities dissipate. The flaw of democracy is that the people with the money can convince the people with the guns to start shooting at any time. The government has blackmailed states into implementing a Communist agenda that reduces the intelligence of citizens. So many lies told over so many years. As long as we try to see things through the toxic filter of Jewish media, what we see will be a mirage that aims to mislead, exploit or destroy us. Coming unglued. The world is coming unglued. Like the Atlantic Gulfstream, the circadian rhythm of the planet has been disrupted. Ever since it was discovered that men will kill each other over practically anything, there have been those who will cultivate disagreements for profit, such as weapons makers who seek to widen their markets by endlessly promoting conflict, or newspaper owners who fan the flames of discord and scandal and watch their profits skyrocket. It’s like we’re all spectators at the old Roman Coliseum only instead of some hapless prisoner getting chewed up by lions, the stakes in this entertainment are if the beast wins much of the known world will be turned to rubble and most of us will be suddenly dead. This is no exaggeration. Just ask the people in Syria or any of a dozen other countries that Israel, using U.S. muscle, has destroyed. It’s like the shadow of Judaism casts its evil pall over every area of human endeavor, pollutes everything, cheapens our lives, makes everything artificial. Why do Jews seek to murder the natural? Why do they strive toward wanting to be everyone’s jailer and demanding immunity for their obnoxious crimes against humanity, whom they call beasts while their heckling Heebs twitch and moan to the insanities of their so-called holy book. They suck the blood of their babies’ penises. How insane do you have to be? Failure to identify this threat and solve this mystery has now placed human society in absolute peril, as the majority of human beings sinks into a second class consciousness, while those with the keys to kosher success join the ranks of ruthless guards keeping watch on a world of pathetic prisoners. Too many things don’t make sense. Is our fear of death so strong that we have to destroy ourselves to prove we are immune to it? Better yet would be acknowledgment of its inevitability that would create a clearer view of who we are and what we’re doing. Because what we’re doing now, and how we are proceeding further into this toxic reality we have created for ourselves, offers us no future except and increasing decay and corruption that the Jews seem to love so much. Like bloodthirsty vultures they look for stricken carcasses on the road that they can devour in their insatiable drive to consume the whole world and everything in it. The Jews intend to kill everything natural and replace it with a Jewish product that can be controlled from afar. They will fail in this attempt and likely destroy humanity in the process. In any case, we are well on our way to being completely regimented with independent consciousness no longer an option. We have no fix on the future. Neither presidential candidate offers us a way out of our trouble because neither will admit the overwhelming control inflicted by the Jews on the whole world is leading to a mindless police state in which our only thought will be to serve the state no matter how cruel and depraved that assignment might be. To disagree with the aims of the Jewish monster state is to court your own death, or at least to be slandered and ostracized by people you thought were your friends. Too many things don’t make sense. What unexplored dark corner of our brains would make us create our own enemy in order to keep our fellows enslaved and exploited? John Kaminski is a writer who lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida, constantly trying to figure out why we are destroying ourselves, and pinpointing a corrupt belief system as the engine of our demise.

292,"Trump Jr. Suspiciously Helps Arizona Woman Push Stalled Car, Uses It As A Photo Op (VIDEO) By Stephanie Kuklish   It is amazing how Trump Jr., known for his rich boy attitude, would suddenly feel the need to get out and help push a stalled car while campaigning in, the now swing state, Arizona . Of course, he didn’t leave without a photo op or video footage being recorded. Tyler Bower, the Maricopa County Republican Party Chairman, posted the footage on Twitter and told the Arizona Republic : “She was just stunned. She was taken aback.” This is why I'm voting Trump! @DonaldJTrumpJr helping push a ladies car off the road in 101 degree heat in Arizona after a rally today #MAGA pic.twitter.com/ngp1ZhS8Wm — Tyler Bowyer (@conservatyler) October 27, 2016 Even the woman who Trump Jr. helped was extremely surprised that any politician would stop to push a car to the side of the road. And seeing as Arizona has been stampeded by Republican rallies this season, it’s a little hard to believe this just happened to take place in Arizona. AZCentral talked about Trump’s presence in the swing state stating : “Donald Trump, whose grip on Arizona’s 11 electoral votes appears to be in jeopardy, will appear in downtown Phoenix for a Saturday rally, his seventh Arizona event this election season.” Arizona, a historically red state through and through, has now been determined as a swing state for the 2016 election season. Arizona residents began evening out their party preference when Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, started making insane remarks about building walls to keep out immigrants and having Mexico pay for it. We are sure his tasteless conversations and sexual assault allegations didn’t help the situation at all. Arizona being a border state is no stranger to immigrant issues, but even with Trump’s hardcore attack on border patrol, Arizona residents still think he is a little hard to swallow. A collaborated effort between The Arizona Republic , Morrison Institute For Public Policy , and The Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication resulted in a poll showing Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton pulling ahead of Trump in the election. Data from Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll from Oct.10-15,2016 If Arizona votes for Hillary Clinton it will be the second non-red candidate that Arizona has ever voted for, the last being Mrs. Clinton’s husband, Bill Clinton in 1996. Though Trump Jr. made an interesting choice when showing his caring side, we still don’t think it will help his dad win over, what should have been, one of the easiest states for the Trump campaign to snag.

293,"A new report finds that the Chicago Police Department has a suicide rate 60 percent higher than the national average. [The study found that of the 10, 000 officer force up to three CPD officers per year commit suicide, the Chicago   reported.  The CPD’s suicide rate corresponds with the extreme level of violence seen in the Windy City. Last year Chicago’s murder rate was higher than that of New York and Los Angeles combined. “There is a problem, and nobody’s doing anything about it,” Ron Rufo, a peer support counselor, told the paper. “Supervisors don’t talk about it. The    don’t talk about it. And it’s like the administration does not want to admit it’s a problem. ” Psychologist Alexa James also noted that CPD officers are living in what many might consider a “war zone” but aren’t getting the mental health treatment they need. “It is a hard, hard job, and police officers get very little support,” she insisted. The Times reported that there are only three   counselors for the entire   force. In contrast, the LAPD has 11 clinicians on staff for an even smaller force. One problem identified is an Illinois   law that prevents anyone who has had mental health issues from being able to gain a firearms license. Because of this law many officers feel reticent to engage a mental health provider for fear of losing the license they need to remain a police officer. Illinois is one of the few states to impose such a law on mental health patients. “But that’s the ” psychologist Marla Friedman said. Police “are afraid if they go to counseling, they’ll lose their job forever. But if they hold it in, they can stay on the job. And then they snap. Which is safer?” “This is a real problem,” Friedman added. “Police officers are the only class of citizen in the U. S. who is going to lose their job for seeking mental health care. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0,346,13.307692307692308,26,0.2832369942196532,0,0,0,0,86.97467059203676,3.8854157403290346,62.47848426461144,3.576389506447308,0.8410404624277457,0.014450867052023121,0.06069364161849711,0.031791907514450865,0.05202312138728324,0.002890173410404624,0.19653179190751446,0.005780346820809248,0.005780346820809248,0.028901734104046242,0.10404624277456648,0,0.08092485549132948,0.02023121387283237,0,0.011560693641618497,0.008670520231213872,0.0953757225433526,0,0.03757225433526012,0.02023121387283237,0.04046242774566474,0,0.014450867052023121,0.028901734104046242,0.02601156069364162,0.12138728323699421,0,0,0.008670520231213872,0.002890173410404624,0,0.011560693641618497,0.02023121387283237,0,0,0.44508670520231214,0.02023121387283237,0.002890173410404624,0,0,0.06647398843930635,0.005780346820809248,0,0.017341040462427744,0.011560693641618497,0.002890173410404624,0,0,0.011560693641618497,0.014450867052023121,0.03757225433526012,0.005780346820809248,0,0.023121387283236993,0.26011560693641617,0.008670520231213872,0,0.014450867052023121,0.07225433526011561,0.0953757225433526,0.031791907514450865,0.014450867052023121,0.07514450867052024,0.10982658959537572,0.09826589595375723,0.02023121387283237,0.002890173410404624,0.046242774566473986,0.08670520231213873,0,0.011560693641618497,0.028901734104046242,0.008670520231213872,0.002890173410404624,0,0,0.002890173410404624,0.07225433526011561,0.05491329479768786,0,0.017341040462427744,0.02601156069364162,0.023121387283236993,0.14739884393063585,0.14739884393063585,0,0.07803468208092486,0.002890173410404624,0,0,39.9,0,2,0,0,1,2.83,36,1,0,10.528125,0,0,0,15.358125000000001,3.5,100.9,118.758125,15.358125000000001,,0,0,0.6363280293755543,0,0.08063375388365411,0,0,0.04201061368397449,0.11040236648764248,0.6122083684647173,0.04201061368397449,0,0.31585985725463245,0,0.6481130570070129,0,0.03532567677717351,0.008050453341153774,0.23208306917783308,0.27315906977011645,-0.8413977773988465,0.7268409302298835,30

296,"A Muslim faith healer has been arrested for the brutal drugging and stabbing of 20 of his disciples at a Sufi shrine in Punjab, Pakistan. [The victims of the massacre were reportedly drugged with   food, stripped naked and then killed with a dagger and stick. Along with the 20 dead, four more people were wounded in the incident, which occurred around midnight between Saturday and Sunday. The four are in critical condition.  The alleged perpetrator of the crime is the    shrine custodian and faith healer Abdul Waheed, who confessed that he killed these people because he feared that they had come to kill him, according to regional police chief Zulfiqar Hameed. “The suspect appears to be paranoid and psychotic, or it could be related to rivalry for the control of shrine,” Hameed said. Pervaiz Haider, a doctor in the hospital treating the survivors of the incident, said most of the dead were hit on the back of the neck. “There are bruises and wounds inflicted by a club and dagger on the bodies of victims,” he said. Waheed was known for erratic behavior but was popular as a faith healer. “Local people say Abdul used to beat the visitors who came to him for treatment of various physical or spiritual ailments,” local rescue service official Mazhar Shah said. “Sometimes he would remove the clothes of his visitors and burn them. ” According to Deputy Commissioner Liaqut Ali Chatha, people would come to the shrine for cleansing their sins and allow the caretakers to beat them with clubs. “But in this case the visitors were first drugged and then stabbed with daggers and hit with clubs, apparently during the cleansing process,” Chatha said. The shrine was built two and a half years ago and named after the late boxer Mohammed Ali, a convert to Islam. It has become a popular place of pilgrimage and healing for Sufi Muslims. Two other suspects were reportedly arrested together with Waheed. Many hardline Muslims regard Sufis as heretics because of the mystical element of their tradition. Earlier this year, militants of the Islamic State ( ) carried out a massive suicide bombing on a prominent Sufi Muslim shrine in Pakistan, killing up to 88 people and wounding more than 300 others. Last November, another Islamic State attack at a Sufi shrine in   Pakistan left a least 52 people dead and more than 100 others injured. A bomb blast hit worshipers participating in a ceremony at the shrine of the Sufi saint Shah Noorani, some 750 kilometers (460 miles) south of Quetta, the provincial capital of restive southern Balochistan province.

297,"  In this Ted Talk , Michael Murphy discusses how his father’s brush with death ultimately opened the doors to his own life path of architecture, but not just as a profession, and not just as a creative expression. When designing, Murphy and his team go beyond the blueprint, considering things like how like airflow and light can produce both a healthy community and gorgeous structures. He shows us his projects in countries like Rwanda and Haiti, and covers his plan for creating The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which mainly aims to heal hearts in the American South. “ Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture — a ll beautiful and visionary and innovative — is also so rare, and seems to serve so very few? And more to the point: With all of this creative talent, what more could we do?” Murphy poses in his talk. He broke into the very soul of his work when he came to the realization that buildings are actually making people sicker.   “ In this hospital in South Africa, patients that came in with, say, a broken leg, to wait in this unventilated hallway, walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis. Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about, and people had died because of it.” With the revelation that hospitals are making patients sicker, he thought of designing one that flips the hallways on the outside, allowing people to walk in the exterior. “ If mechanical systems rarely work, what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation, and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?” he said. He then discussed the incredible community aspect of following through with his healing niche in the architecture world. “ We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called “Ubudehe,” which means “community works for the community.” Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. “ Ultimately, the healing journey became twofold, as it was both the process of building to heal as well as allowing an entire community to heal. “We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or ‘lo-fab,’ and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve. Think of it like the local food movement, but for architecture. And we’re convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world, and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture,” he explained. In his talk, Murphy reveals how he learned that architecture is more than what it seems. It “can be a transformative engine for change.” Watch the full talk below. Perhaps it will show you how your work can be more than what it seems, too.

298,"Africa , China , Hybrid Wars , United States By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) The most colonized and exploited continent in the history of the world is once more the center of global competition, albeit this time the form of rivalry between the Great Powers has taken on a much more nuanced, though no less intense, form. The US, France, and their unipolar allies want to retain Africa as their exclusive labor, market, and resource reserve for the foreseeable future, both out of their own material self-interest and with the added strategic benefit of depriving China and others of its economic fruits. Contrarily, China wants to integrate the world’s fastest growing economies and populations into the unfolding multipolar world order and give them a fair chance at succeeding in the global system. The contrast between the West’s neo-colonialism and China’s liberating sovereignty couldn’t be more crisp, and it’s this opposition of diametrically opposed global strategies and development models that sets the stage for the grand proxy battle between the US and China over Africa. Just as much as China needs Africa in order to maintain its steady growth rates into the foreseeable future and ensure its domestic stability, so too does the US want to ‘poach’ Africa from China in order to offset the structural sustainability of its number one rival’s global leadership. The nature of the African-wide proxy conflict is that China is ardently working to finance, construct, and connect various infrastructural projects to one another in order to create a supraregional web of intermodal transport corridors that could then perfectly complement the maritime portion of the One Belt One Road (“New Silk Road”) global vision, while the US is trying with equal fervor to seize control of key nodes along these transnational routes as well as strategically disrupt crucial portions in order to increase China’s dependence on the unipolar-influenced areas. As the ultimate last resort, however, the US, the “world island” in all the manners that it can be strategically understood as, will pull out all the stops and unleash a ‘scorched earth’ trail of Hybrid War destruction in its wake while it strategically retreats back to its self-sufficient “Fortress North America” as the final coup de grace in the African proxy war against China. More than likely, it won’t ever get to that dramatic of an absolute point whereby the US fully retreats from Africa or totally destroys the continent with Hybrid War, but realistically speaking, there’ll likely be a blended development of scenarios that takes place in this heated theater of competition over the coming decades that integrates elements of both extremes. China will predictably succeed in spearheading several ultra-strategic New Silk Road development corridors in Africa, while the US will probably sabotage a few others and unleash a handful of Hybrid Wars to keep the existing ways indefinitely at bay from fully actualizing their envisioned geo-economic potential. There’s no surefire way to know with absolutely certainty what the future will bring, but it’s possible to acquire an educated expectation about the structural and systemic manner in which the identified group of states will be targeted by US-provoked Hybrid Wars. Even accounting for the possibility that some of the forthcoming examined scenarios might be “naturally occurring” in that they require little if any external pressure to instigate, there’s still a strong likelihood that at least some of the investigated possibilities will eventually occur to varying extents and that the geopolitical repercussions will indisputably impact quite negatively on China and the larger multipolar world’s grand position in the New Cold War. This section of the book is organized in such a manner that Part I will describe Africa’s overall geopolitical situation, highlighting the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism (sometimes overlapping, other times not) over the continent’s affairs in order to clearly illustrate the preexisting advantages and obstacles to China’s New Silk Road vision. The subsequent chapters of the African Hybrid War research will then comprehensively examine the five separate categories of states and their pertinent neighbors that the author has already identified as being relevantly incorporated into the immediate thesis. To remind the reader about what was described in Part III of the book’s Introduction and to expand upon the earlier presented paradigmatic map in a more structurally detailed manner, the following cartographic revision will be henceforth used as the point of reference in guiding the research beyond Part I: Key * Yellow – East Africa/East African Federation * Blue – Central-Southern Africa * Black – Failed State Belt * Red – Lake Chad Region * Hashed/Thatched Lines – countries that will inevitably become involved in the targeted category states’ Hybrid War destabilization, whether as an aggressive actor, a passive victim, or a blended mix thereof. Schematic Observations A few comments need to be stated about the above map before commencing Part I of the African Hybrid War research: Southern African Cone: Firstly, while it’s conceptually possible for all states in Africa (or anywhere in the world, for that matter) to be afflicted by Hybrid War, keeping in accordance with the axiom that this method of warfare is more often than not applied in disrupting multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects and/or seizing control of them, it can be surmised that the ones which could most radically revolutionize the continent’s geopolitical and geo-economic would be most actively targeted and consequently receive the highest likelihood of some sort of Hybrid War destabilization in the coming future. All of this will be described in detail in Part I, but for now it’s enough to know that the identified states lay along the paths of China’s presently constructed Silk Road routes or most probable forthcoming projects that it could pursue in achieving its grand strategic ends. It should be clarified at this point that the Southern African Cone was not included in the above model because its economic corridors are relatively well-established and have already been utilized for some time by all sorts of Great Powers, the West obviously included. Furthermore, concerning Namibia and Botswana’s global connectivity via South Africa, and to an extent, even Zimbabwe and Mozambique’s as well, this mostly deals with the one-way transport of natural resources and less so with each respective state’s labor and market potential. While each of these countries have a given role that they play vis-à-vis the Chinese economy, none of them except for South Africa (the hub through which most of their exports, barring Mozambique’s, pass) is integral enough to be targeted by their own Hybrid War. Theoretically speaking, disruptions in the regional periphery around South Africa could have a strategic effect in putting pressure on the country’s multipolar leadership and pave the way for a regime change scenario, but given the rotten nature of corrupt South African politics, it’s more expected that traditional ‘soft coup’ means such as constitutional technicalities and simple Color Revolutions (i.e. the anti-Rousseff coup in Brazil) would be used in this instance. Additionally, the resources of the population-sparse countries of Namibia and Botswana and the general market and labor potential of South Africa are already pretty much integrated into the larger global economy, so there are many existing unipolar stakeholders that would also be adversely affected by a severe disruption in or around their common point of African access. The same can’t be said so much about Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the former rich in minerals such as diamonds and platinum while the latter is poised to become one of the world’s largest LNG exporters, so it’s entirely possible that they may be targeted sometime in the future. But even so, it would be less in connection with China’s multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects than with their own individual standalone potentials in their respective fields, thus strategically differentiating them from the other countries included in the present study (although that is not to say that Hybrid War techniques would not be used – they probably would to a large extent). Insular Importance: In relation to the above, the insular countries of Africa were also not included in the continental overview, although they too play an important role in its evolving geopolitical paradigm. Nevertheless, because they’re island nations, they’re not directly connected to anything else besides the high seas, so although they may have valuable transit node status for China as an integral component of its Sea Lines of Communication, they’re not as directly affected by the region-stretching Hybrid War study that was commenced for the mainland. Nevertheless, because each of them could play a pivotal role in influencing continental affairs if properly utilized by a partnering Great Power, it’s worthwhile to very concisely comment on how they fit into the larger strategic equation that will be described throughout this work: * Yellow – Canary Islands (Spain): This legacy holding allows Madrid to exert influence near the coasts of Morocco and Western Sahara, both thought to be rich with fish and possible energy resources. * Green – Cabo Verde (formerly Cape Verde prior to late-2013): The former Portuguese colony connects the North and South Atlantic and offers a strategic position near the mouth of the Senegal River, as well as being positioned along an important oceanic route that the US and EU must take to access West Africa. * Blue – São Tomé and Príncipe: Another former Portuguese colony, this one is crucially located in the hydrocarbon-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea and in close proximity to the shoreline of Africa’s largest economy, Nigeria. * Violet – Comoros and the French overseas department of Mayotte: These two locations are almost on top of northern Mozambique’s LNG-prospected Rovuma Basin and thus near what will likely become a major energy exporting area in the near future. * Orange – Seychelles: The former UK-colonized island chain lies along the route of approach that India and China must take in accessing the burgeoning East African marketplace, and it’s for this strategically competitive reason that New Delhi has proactively sought to build a naval base and position some of its military units there in order to “contain” China. * Unmarked – Mauritius and the French island of Reunion: These two insular areas are not directly relevant to Africa’s mainland geopolitical order, although they do acquire significance vis-à-vis Madagascar and the US-controlled Indian Ocean bastion of Diego Garcia. Transregional Conflict Overspill: One of the most striking aspects of the reference map is that it clearly delineates the geopolitical fault lines where Hybrid War conflicts could easily become transregional: Out of all of the areas designated by the map, it’s most probable that the uncontrollably violent processes in the Failed State Belt of the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan would be the ones to spread to other parts of Africa, at least as regards the continent’s conflicts that are presently ongoing (and not accounting for those that have yet to possibly erupt). In particular, CAR’s chaos could result in a refugee and militant overspill to Cameroon and Chad, possibly leading to these respective Christian- and Muslim-led governments supporting their own confessional sides in the country’s unresolved civil war. The misleading “Clash of Civilizations” narrative that would assuredly be purposely pushed by the Western mainstream media will be discussed later on when addressing the Failed State Belt, but at this moment it’s useful just to be aware of the transregional “infection” potential that the CAR has in affecting the Lake Chad region. Additionally, the country’s domestic difficulties could also spread southward into the northern reaches of the Central-Southern state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), representing a dual destabilization threat emanating from the CAR. South Sudan can do something similar to the CAR in relation to the northern part of the DRC, but possibly even to the Horn of Africa state of Ethiopia and the East African state of Uganda as well. Tellingly, these latter two states are actively involved in the conflict resolution process in South Sudan and are jostling against one another for influence there in order to carve out defensive buffers (but also markets, of course) to protect themselves from this scenario. It should go without saying that South Sudan was only brought into existence because it was forcibly severed from Sudan proper over a three-decade-long civil war period, and the dynamic of anti-Khartoum action hasn’t stopped since Juba gained its independence in 2011. Therefore, South Sudan represents an even larger asymmetrical regional threat than CAR does, and their combined destabilization potential explains why they’re both categorized together as part of the Failed State Belt. If their respective conflicts somehow merged into a transnational conflagration, then that would represent a large-scale Hybrid War threat in the geographic heart of Africa, but the closest this has henceforth come has been the over-exaggerated threat of Joseph Kony. With reference to the Failed State Belt’s Hybrid War vulnerabilities and the transregionalization that its internal conflicts pose, it’s little wonder then that the US exploited the mystique around this warlord in order to deploy a limited but very strategic contingent of its special forces to Uganda, South Sudan, DRC, and CAR. Almost as an afterthought but drawing on the tangent of transregional conflict overlap, it’s topically pertinent to recall the Darfur Conflict and how this essentially was a proxy competition between the Lake Chad regional state of Chad and the extended Failed State Belt and somewhat Gulf-influenced state of Sudan. It’s no longer as relevant of a geopolitical item as it once was during the mid-2000s, but it nevertheless still has the potential to re-erupt in the future, especially if the externally directed Sudanese dissolution process speeds up and makes headway in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. Lastly, there’s the realistic possibility that the US’ attempts to instigate a Hybrid War in Burundi could set off a chain reaction of destabilization in the eastern DRC, Rwanda (and by extent, possibly up to Uganda), and western Tanzania, thereby making this geographically tiny state a disproportionately large trigger in upsetting the regional balance. Although there’s not yet an active conflict in Burundi anywhere on par with the scale of what’s been raging in the CAR and South Sudan over the past couple of years, this doesn’t mean that one can’t quickly develop if the entire state collapses under Hybrid War pressure, and this disturbing scenario will certainly be explored more at length later on in the work. Mapping out the expected transregional conflict overspill zones in Africa, one can unmistakably see that it’s the entire Upper-Central (Failed State Belt) and the eastern portion of the Central-Southern zones of Africa that are most at risk of this destructive process unfolding. Accordingly, this realization leads one to conclude that the DRC and the areas immediately abutting it provide the most fertile ground for the transnationalization of domestic conflicts, which somewhat (but not totally) explains why the Second Congo War eventually came to involve states located far away from the actual battlespace and be nicknamed “ Africa’s World War ”. To put it another way, the Hybrid War vulnerabilities of the identified area combined with its obvious geostrategic centrality to the African continent makes it doubly capable of sucking countless states into a literal Black Hole of Chaos that could easily become the ultimate proxy war climax between the US and China.

300,"November 2015 Ads Watch: Israel Loving Hollywood Actor Just Issued Major Plea To America In 3 Minutes That’ll Rock The Election Oct 27, 2016 Previous post In an impassioned reminder that the freedoms and safety enjoyed by millions of Americans are at risk, actor John Voight has issued a clarion call for voters to save their nation by preventing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from being elected. “We were once a country of freedom, and now we are becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our own cities: Ferguson, Milwaukee, Orlando, Baltimore,” said Voight in a new video. “We are all witness to our own people killing our police.” Voight has said in the past that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stirs fear in his opponents because he “represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it.” Voight said terrorism has come to America’s shores under the policies of leading Democrats. “Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country, and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and FOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK",1,200,28.571428571428573,7,0.385,0,0,0,0,88.68681318681318,9.12994350282486,93.30379746835443,25.774193548387096,0.74,0.005,0.015,0.025,0.07,0.05,0.135,0.01,0.025,0.01,0.05,0,0.07,0,0,0.01,0.025,0.05,0.01,0.05,0.005,0.045,0,0.01,0,0.005,0.12,0,0,0.005,0,0,0.005,0.035,0,0,0.425,0,0.02,0,0,0.025,0,0,0.01,0,0.02,0.01,0,0.015,0.005,0.035,0,0,0.035,0.18,0,0,0.04,0.03,0.065,0.07,0.035,0.055,0.15,0.095,0.02,0,0.035,0.135,0.005,0,0.015,0,0.015,0,0,0.01,0.11,0.07,0,0,0.015,0.045,0.12,0.11,0.045,0.03,0,0,0,23,0,1,0,4,0,0,39,12,5,11,0,0,0,29,4,60,93,29,,0,0,0.660309331561485,0,0.0779292055122247,0,0.252650308587072,0,0,0.7672308304983563,0.5035213014023038,0.2970504159217058,0.4817765909574502,0,0.0779292055122247,0,0.10583941605839416,0.014598540145985401,0.21897810218978103,0.33941605839416056,-0.7874695755044181,0.6605839416058394,19
301,"Man who ‘doesn’t care’ about election acting like some sort of Buddha 08-11-16 A MAN is irritating his colleagues by being self-consciously indifferent to the presidential election. Tom Booker, an accounts administrator from Maidstone, is rising above the frantic speculation with an annoyingly philosophical approach like he is some sort of mystical guru. Co-worker Nikki Hollis said: “The office is rife with chat about whether Donald Trump is going to annihilate us all by declaring war on China, or if Hillary Clinton is actually a robot controlled by the Illuminati, but Tom won’t join in. “He just gives this beatific smile and says something like ‘guys, it’s out of our hands’ or ‘it’s up to America to make their choice’ and then changes the subject. “He won’t even join in with our misty-eyed chat about how much we admire Barack Obama and secretly fancy Michelle. “I used to think he was just a laidback guy, but his lack of hysterical overreaction is making me suspect he voted for Brexit.” Booker said: “I just think they need to chill out. Also, I don’t understand politics and don’t want anyone to realise.” Save",1,203,22.555555555555557,9,0.26108374384236455,0,0,0,0,73.12554539057003,2.1840029613599468,79.87328954570334,43.744433497536946,0.8177339901477833,0,0.0049261083743842365,0.04926108374384237,0.03940886699507389,0.04433497536945813,0.20689655172413793,0.0049261083743842365,0.009852216748768473,0.04926108374384237,0.04926108374384237,0,0.07881773399014778,0.009852216748768473,0.009852216748768473,0.029556650246305417,0.0049261083743842365,0.14285714285714285,0.009852216748768473,0.034482758620689655,0.014778325123152709,0.06403940886699508,0.024630541871921183,0.0049261083743842365,0.034482758620689655,0.019704433497536946,0.08866995073891626,0,0,0.0049261083743842365,0,0,0.019704433497536946,0.024630541871921183,0.014778325123152709,0.014778325123152709,0.47783251231527096,0,0.014778325123152709,0,0.019704433497536946,0.029556650246305417,0,0,0.029556650246305417,0.014778325123152709,0.024630541871921183,0.054187192118226604,0.0049261083743842365,0.019704433497536946,0.024630541871921183,0.014778325123152709,0,0,0.014778325123152709,0.24630541871921183,0,0,0.024630541871921183,0.03940886699507389,0.06896551724137931,0.08374384236453201,0.024630541871921183,0.034482758620689655,0.15763546798029557,0.11330049261083744,0.019704433497536946,0,0.04926108374384237,0.059113300492610835,0.0049261083743842365,0.0049261083743842365,0.0049261083743842365,0,0.0049261083743842365,0,0,0.034482758620689655,0.14285714285714285,0.034482758620689655,0,0.04433497536945813,0.009852216748768473,0.0049261083743842365,0.16748768472906403,0.17733990147783252,0.019704433497536946,0.03940886699507389,0,9.75,0,5,4,12,1,0,5,0,16,0,12,5.5,0,9.75,0,28.75,1,39,68.75,28.75,,0.4208680109932326,0,0.2714970279031851,0.22966848451216434,0.4721359549995794,0.06936540706703205,0,0.2714970279031851,0,0.5439141336844762,0,0.4721359549995794,0.29075287651080506,0,0.12973190755680383,0,0.11604439959636731,0.004036326942482341,0.1574167507568113,0.27749747729566093,-0.5193335734321882,0.7225025227043391,24
302,"Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn told Breitbart News that she hopes for the elimination of net neutrality with a Republican Congress and administration. [“I think that the chairman will move through the vote process and rescind the order and if that’s the way the chairman wants to proceed I am fine with that,” Blackburn explained of the Federal Communications Commission. “I think that the marketplace would appreciate it if there was a clean repeal of that order. It would get rid of Title II (public utility regulation). Then we can focus on   regulation and preservation of an open internet, and focus on cybersecurity provisions and broadband expansions, and maybe focus on getting spectrum auction right. ”  Congresswoman Blackburn discussed paid prioritization, in which content providers such as Netflix can pay Verizon to better handle its bandwidth. YouTube and Netflix, at peak hours, use half of the bandwidth in the United States. Congresswoman Blackburn said that the best way to handle this issue involves “content distributers and Internet service providers work[ing] this out at the negotiating table. ” Congresswoman Blackburn discussed the broadband internet’s importance to the economy, saying, “Rural broadband is the top education, economic development, and healthcare access issue in my district. I have 16 rural counties, and you do not get economic development and you cannot utilize telemedicine and remote monitoring and you cannot recruit companies and factories without consistent and steady broadband access. ” She told Breitbart News, “When it comes to broadband investment, you know this administration cannot achieve its goals for economic growth without broadband investment. It is the infrastructure issue of this decade. ”",0,267,20.53846153846154,13,0.40074906367041196,0,0,0,0,77.25348184898746,11.70409584173629,55.95250936329588,68.19983948635634,0.7378277153558053,0.026217228464419477,0.02247191011235955,0.0149812734082397,0.02247191011235955,0.00749063670411985,0.15355805243445692,0,0,0.00749063670411985,0.07116104868913857,0,0.056179775280898875,0,0,0.003745318352059925,0,0.07116104868913857,0,0.04868913857677903,0.0149812734082397,0.07865168539325842,0,0,0.0299625468164794,0.02247191011235955,0.10486891385767791,0,0,0,0.00749063670411985,0,0.011235955056179775,0.02247191011235955,0,0,0.4344569288389513,0,0.00749063670411985,0,0.018726591760299626,0.06741573033707865,0,0,0.018726591760299626,0.00749063670411985,0.011235955056179775,0,0.03745318352059925,0.011235955056179775,0.02247191011235955,0,0,0,0.00749063670411985,0.15355805243445692,0.011235955056179775,0.003745318352059925,0.00749063670411985,0.0449438202247191,0.13108614232209737,0.0449438202247191,0.02247191011235955,0.0599250936329588,0.10861423220973783,0.11235955056179775,0,0,0.03745318352059925,0.10112359550561797,0,0.033707865168539325,0,0,0,0,0,0.00749063670411985,0.06741573033707865,0.06367041198501873,0,0.0149812734082397,0,0.018726591760299626,0.11610486891385768,0.11610486891385768,0.003745318352059925,0.11235955056179775,0.0149812734082397,3,0,6,0,6,3,4,0,2.83,0,0,0,9,0,3,0,16.83,7,11,34.83,16.83,,0.15686671908283387,0,0.2711923793731366,0,0.2711923793731366,0.15686671908283387,0.1987625491245426,0,0.1493047923334189,0,0,0,0.35821586295739605,0,0.11034777731716484,0,0.0597168505836852,0.02483766809778945,0.03903062129652628,0.12358513997800093,0.33832887325819344,0.8764148600219991,20

305,"45 Weird Bans on Women in Iran Gender apartheid in the Islamic Republic. October 27, 2016 Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Under Iran’s Islamic laws, women are prohibited from performing basic day-to-day activities. I had firsthand experience of witnessing many of these strange and bizarre bans while living in Iran and other Muslim countries. Millions of women, including my relatives in Iran and Syria, continue to face these injustices. Some of the following rules, which are derived from Iran’s Islamic constitution and moral police codes, were recently reported on by Deutsche Welle Farsi . They exist in may other Islamic countries as well: 1. Women are prohibited from taking selfies with soccer players. Specifically, Iran’s “moral committee” has banned women from taking selfies with famous soccer players. 2. Iranian women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently issued an Islamic fatwa regarding officially banning women from riding bicycles. He argued that ""riding bicycles often attracts the attention of men and exposes the society to corruption, and thus contravenes women's chastity, and it must be abandoned,” according to Iran’s state-run media. 3. Coffee shops are prohibited from hiring women. According to Iran’s police, women are banned from working in any cafés. 4. Iranian Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men. But Iranian Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women. 5. It is forbidden for women to wear boots over their pants. (Why? I am not sure what is Iran’s Islamic logic behind this.) 6. Women are not allowed to wear hats instead of veils to cover their hair. 7. Women are not allowed to wear tight clothes that show their body curves. 8. Women are prohibited from wearing tight clothes for swimming. 9. Women are forbidden from changing their religion or criticizing Muhammad, Allah, the Supreme Leader and other Muslim leaders. 10. Women are prohibited from entering sport stadiums and watching men’s sports. 11. In Iran, buses and subways are divided in two sections. The larger front section is for men, the smaller back section is for women. Women are prohibited from entering the men's section even if there are no seats left in the back and there are plenty of empty seats in front of the bus. 12. According to Iran’s moral police, women are banned from wearing leggings. 13. Women are prohibited from showing strands of their hair on any side. Article 683 states: “Those women that appear in the streets and public places without the Islamic hijab, shall be sentenced from ten days to two months’ imprisonment or fined from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand Rials.” 14. Women are banned from going camping with men. 15. Any kind of contraceptive surgery is not allowed for women. 16. Women are banned from entering coffeehouses or smoking hookah. 17. Women are not allowed to initiate divorce. Men have the right to do so. 18. According to Iran’s family code, women cannot travel abroad except with the permission of their custodian or natural guardian (husband, father, etc.). They also cannot obtain a passport without the consent of their husbands. 19. Women are banned from wearing clothes with writing on them. 20. Women are banned from taking their hijab off in any sport event, including in the Olympics. 21. Iranian women are prohibited from pursuing education in some academic fields. Iranian regime's oil minister argued that “education of women in the field of operations such as drilling and processing and so on that require (physical) activities in operational areas and sites is useless and these are masculine (men’s) jobs.” 22. Women are not allowed to work in any occupation if their husband disagrees with it. Article 1105 of the Civil Code states, “In relations between husband and wife, the position of the head of the family exclusively belongs to the husband.” In addition, when it comes to employment laws, Article 1117 of the Civil Code indicates, “The husband can prevent his wife from an occupation or technical profession which is incompatible with the family’s interests or the dignity of him or his wife.” 23. Women are banned from receiving the same amount of inheritance as their male relatives. Even if a husband dies, the wife will receive only one-eighth of the inheritance if she has a child. 24. Women are forbidden from having any physical contact with men, including shaking hands. 25. Women are banned from becoming a Supreme Leader. 26. Girls, as young as 9 years old, are not allowed to object to their parents decision to marry them off. 27. Women are not allowed to object to their husband’s requests for sex. The law of Tamkin means women’s submission, obedience, full accessibility and unhampered sexual availability to her husband. Sexual availability is considered a woman’s duty and a man’s right. 28. Women are not allowed to bring lawsuits if they are raped, unless they have four witnesses. 29. Women are banned from socializing or dating men. 30. Women are banned from attracting attention in public through “flamboyant behavior” such as laughing loudly. 31. Women are not allowed to show any part of their skin except the face. It is encouraged to cover the face as well. 32. Women are not allowed to have any kind of alcoholic drinks. 33. Women are not allowed to dance. 34. Women are forbidden from being lesbian. Sex between two women is adultery and the punishments range from stoning to execution. 35. Women are banned from listening to “forbidden” music. 36. Women are not allowed to have pets, such as a dog. 37. Women are banned from adopting except if they have a husband and he agrees to do so. 38. Women are prohibited from gambling in any kind of event. 39. Women are banned from having sex or marrying a man up to five or six months after their divorce. 40.

Women are banned from being judges. 44. Women are banned from striking their husband, but men are allowed to do so in some circumstances. 45. Women are not allowed to show their jewelry in public. Some women continue to defy these rules, but many face severe punishment and discrimination for performing some of these normal day-to-day activities.

307,"Leave a reply Mike Adams – My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning in the next few days that will end the Clintons’ reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency. The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found). The so-called “deep state”— the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy — has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival. It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn’t pro-Trump. They’re still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach…) Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to “Plan B” which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn’t exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest… In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many. The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for “racketeering” activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to “reverse the Clinton coup” that’s attempting to take over America and destroy it from within. Even if you don’t believe Pieczenik — and I fully realize he’s controversial in his own way — this short video is a very important “must watch” explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing…“we’ve initiated a counter-coup…” The Clintons are going to go “full murder” in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going “full murder” in an attempt to save themselves. I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or “natural” deaths involving people like James Comey, who’d better have armed security personnel around him at all times. Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that’s increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see). A deal has already been struck with Obama Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton’s head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There’s no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?). As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime — CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. — is going to explode into an all-out “bat-s##t crazy” conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that’s imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh? Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors). If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America : • The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime. • Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on. • The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated… (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections). • Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don’t get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds. • The NSA likely goes into “full dump” mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their “Lolita Express” pedo joy rides. • Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into “destroy the Clintons” mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton… as do we all, come to think of it.) • The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that’s what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can’t get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert). I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and “face plant” into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn’t have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she’d probably launch them just to change the narrative…) As for me, I’m with anybody who’s trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I’ve had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they’re universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There’s no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all. Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit.

308,"Region: USA in the World When countries are in trouble they always react the same way. If they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public finances, whether through austerity or centrally-dictated spending programmes. When there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation. When wars are taking place elections are cancelled so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict. These measures have the effect of entrenching the “Establishment”, whoever that may be at a given time, and excluding others. People can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the Establishment, with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios. Only when the Establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of debate, action and participation, which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries . Now Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States on an avowedly anti-Establishment platform. He tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise. That in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract. Too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be unacceptable, without giving a reason why, and Trump was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views don’t entitle them to one. But is Trump’s election the democratic revolution he claims? Does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless? In order to exercise any power President Trump will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the Establishment of, but worse. For a while he might get away with it, but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term. All we will have is the methods, with no returns: Establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are somebody, but are in fact Donald Trump. Who do you think you are? As it turned out, Hillary Clinton failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a Republican. If you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it. People in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful. If they stay in power for too long, they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support. Hillary Clinton has been a national figure in the US for a generation. Her accession to the Democratic nomination was seen as almost dynastic, a factor which harmed Senator Edward Kennedy when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was referred to as the “Establishment candidate” throughout the campaign, particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist Bernie Sanders, who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain . For a Republican, all this would play well, except in extreme circumstances such as Watergate. For a Democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the party’s voter base, and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at home, particularly when enough scandal attaches to Clinton as it is due to her business and government dealings. Clinton was about her nice office in Washington, not the problems of real Democrats. Keeping her there would have solved nothing. This was seen most clearly in Wisconsin, a traditional Democratic mainstay which voted for Trump despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and Clinton . Many of those who disliked Trump still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as Clinton, who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do. He was “the-none-of-the-above” candidate from early on in the primary election period. Poacher turns gamekeeper Whether Trump would have got anywhere near the Republican nomination had there been a Republican president for the last eight years is unlikely. Only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of government, and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power. The Republican Party will remain largely embarrassed by Trump, despite his victory. He may be the voters’ idea of a president, but he isn’t what Republican politicians see as a Republican president. As the Huffington Post published underneath every article about Trump from January until election day, “Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims – 1.6 billion members of an entire religion – from entering the US.” Ask most Republican Congressmen, who control both houses, whether this describes a Republican President and you know what the answer will be, though Trump himself revels in such depictions. Well before the end of his term Trump will have become the Establishment himself. So to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the US has he will either have to carry the party and the military-industrial establishment with him, and become more embedded than Clinton is to do it, or try and purge the very many who will oppose him. Throughout his “business career”, if repeated bankruptcy, con, robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a term, Trump has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper. Whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined America’s global reputation with impunity is another matter. Presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the CIA or the industrial and media barons. If Trump tries, he will have to exert extreme control to do it, and become more exclusive than the Establishment itself. Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment. Despite his long years of public service, he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be – a good man out of his depth in murky Washington. Trump has never held any elected office. Is he going to take on those same forces and turn them into public servants? More than he can chew out One of Trump’s selling points with poorer Americans is that he pledged to stop US involvement in costly foreign wars. In particular, he said he could work with Russia and saw no need for the continual war rhetoric coming out of every Western government. Obviously this plays well with those who can’t afford to feed their families. The money will be spent on them, not bombs. But is it even possible to reduce the US military commitment, with so many bases, so many troops employed, so many weapons which will be manufactured and sold regardless? Trump may well find that the best way to stop foreign wars is to buy up all the weapons so that potential enemies don’t get them. The War on Terror would greatly diminish if the US didn’t supply arms to its favourite terrorists whilst pretending to fight them. But there is a vast industry devoted to maintaining armament and troop levels, which can only be justified by fighting wars against enemies real or imagined . So how would Trump go about achieving such a goal? Trump and his supporters are sons and daughters of the Bolsheviks. Convinced they are right, they think they can say what they like, do what they like and everyone else just has to put up with it because any opponent is part of the corrupt Establishment. It is no coincidence that Nigel Farage, former leader of UKIP and the main proponent of the UK leaving the European Union, has described Trump’s victory as a “ Supersized Brexit . Farage’s supporters behave the same way: everyone they don’t like hasn’t got the right to an opinion anymore, because they lost, and were inherently bad to begin with. Based on all we have seen so far, if someone stands in the way of Trump’s ambitions as president they will be told that they are holdovers from a corrupt system, serving masters who are now enemies of the people, and must therefore be removed. In order to get rid of them he would have to use extralegal measures in many cases, and deny them an opinion or another job. The “people” Trump would be referring to are the dispossessed whose votes he courted, who by definition don’t have levers of power of their own. It hardly gives those people more power to demonise certain individuals on presidential say-so, but that is all Trump has offered so far, or may ever be capable of offering. Trump has enjoyed spreading hatred of various minority groups. As many commentators have pointed out, he has broken all the usual rules of presidential candidate conduct and got away with it. But this simply makes anyone a potential victim, and encourages such behaviour to go on unchecked. A system which was there long before a here-today-gone-tomorrow politician has all the levers his supporters don’t to maintain itself. But if attacked, it will have no alternative but to fight fire with fire. A battle for control fought behind the scenes would empower Trump’s supporters even less, whilst not addressing the specific problems which made them see Trump as the solution. Not beating them, only joining them This presidential election campaign was the ugliest within living memory. This played into Trump’s hands: it brought those who were told they couldn’t behave like that into the mainstream, and Trump as the outsider reaped the benefit. But it also created the expectation that this will be followed through: if you start such a process, you are expected to finish it. A poll taken just before Election Day showed that if Bernie Sanders had been running against Clinton and Trump he would have won by a landslide . Sanders supporters remain angry that he was denied the nomination by what they thought was an establishment fraud. Now Clinton has lost, they will make further efforts to ensure that anyone with Clinton credentials is neutralised so that they can present a more credible candidate in 2020, and will have much moral weight and grassroots sympathy behind this effort. As Clinton supporters will fight back in the same terms, the Democratic Party is likely to spend the next four years fighting itself rather than Trump, trying to exclude its own members in the same way Trump supporters want to get rid of everyone they don’t like. The Republicans have the same problem. Trump was as offensive to his intra-party opponents as he was to Clinton. Those who think themselves “real” Republicans will be emboldened by the pro-Sanders Democrats to seek to reclaim the party and its voters from the Trump constituency in the same way. This will generate more exclusion and counter-exclusion, even through Republican Congress versus Republican President battles, with each trying to show themselves to the public as More Republican Than Thou. Both Trump and Sanders supporters will now feel that they are the new “Establishment” because they have been backed by their respective publics to overthrow the old one. Though both Trump and Sanders were the none-of-the-above candidates, they will be the above from now on. To justify their initial behaviour, and satisfy their support, they will have to be even worse Establishments than the ones they have removed, more intolerant, more exclusive …more arbitrary. If the old guard is going to come back, they will have no choice but to adopt the same tactics. The choice at the next election will be between groups of battle-hardened intolerants who are more interested in serving their friends and stuffing their enemies than in the disaffected people in their midst. Trump has not overthrown the failed political Establishment and methods which created the disaffection he has exploited, he has confirmed their validity. Trump may change the personnel, but the Establishment will be the same animal, all the more dangerous for its delusions to the contrary.

309,"HONG KONG  —   For Asia, the bad news this week was not that Donald J. Trump detailed a   plan to toughen American trade policy, especially toward China. It was that Hillary Clinton’s campaign accused Mr. Trump a few hours later of purloining her ideas, noting that she favored similar action on those issues. A strong dose of economic populism, with an occasional sprinkling of geopolitics, has suffused the trade plans of the leading American presidential candidates this year. Vying for votes, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are each promising to do more to preserve American jobs at a time of slowing global economic growth. And China  —   with its vast trade, rising international influence and authoritarian government  —   is a natural target. Presidential candidates vow every four years to do more to help American workers facing competition from abroad. After taking office, they have consistently pursued more conciliatory trade policies toward China, seeing a strategic benefit to warm relations with Beijing. But broad political distress this year over the loss of   working class jobs to global competition, coupled with mounting concern about China’s increasingly assertive military posture, suggest that the next president could actually follow through on the pledges. If they do, the policies could pose a real predicament for China, and for other Asian countries that depend on its economy. Millions of jobs in China and across the region require the continued willingness of the United States to rely overwhelmingly on imports to supply American families with everything from the clothes they wear to the smartphones they carry. Rapid economic growth in China and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country’s need for huge exports to the American market. But China’s economy has recently slowed, hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers. Weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for China to maintain a large trade surplus with the United States, selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys. For years, China has exported four times as much to the United States as it imports, and it continues to do so. “If there are tougher trade policies from the United States,” said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, “that will dampen Chinese exports. ” The candidates plan to take direct aim at the two countries’ trade gap. They want to label China as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets. They want to file more trade cases against China and impose more tariffs. They want to investigate how the Chinese government subsidizes businesses. They also want to rethink big trade deals. Mr. Trump wants to scrap the   Partnership, a   agreement between the United States and a group of countries, mostly in Asia. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign took a subtly different position, saying that she opposed the agreement in its current form. The Asian countries involved in the trade pact, notably Vietnam and Japan, made significant concessions to American negotiators because they felt threatened by China’s rise. Now, the presidential candidates are lumping them together with China, holding them responsible for killing American jobs. With few exceptions, Chinese officials have tried to steer clear of commenting on the American candidates. Even Chinese academics, the usual pipeline to Beijing’s thinking, have been wary of doing so, to avoid being accused of violating China’s policy of not interfering publicly in other countries’ politics. To the extent that Chinese experts say anything, it is to express hope that this year’s talk of getting tough on trade will not be a harbinger of policy shifts ahead. “There is no big difference from previous presidential campaigns, only more emphasis, due to the poor world trade performances” and weak global economic prospects, said He Weiwen, a   of the  . S. . U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade in Beijing. The uncertainty for China, and much of Asia, is whether the candidates will sing the same trade tunes once in office. Mr. Trump’s confrontational approach would seem to indicate some  . Mrs. Clinton seems less likely to change American policies, given that she supported President Obama’s free trade efforts during his first term of office, when she was secretary of state. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Mr. Obama, at least initially, all tried to help China become more involved in the world economy. They hoped that more enmeshed trade and financial relationships would mean a more democratic China with closer diplomatic ties to the West. It seemed to work for a while. But in the last three years, China, under President Xi Jinping, has shifted toward more authoritarian rule. China has embarked on a   military buildup, constructed artificial islands with   runways in the South China Sea and challenged Japan’s control of a cluster of islands north of Taiwan. And a combination of strict censorship and comprehensive propaganda has fanned the already strong nationalism of the Chinese public. Those geopolitics have left American policy makers with two choices, neither of them appetizing. Further trade with China and additional investments there by Western multinationals could strengthen the Chinese economy and help Beijing afford even more ambitious territorial and military policies. Discouraging trade and investment could cause lower economic growth that might slow China’s military rise but also might feed   sentiment and foster public demands for more assertive foreign policy. If the candidates’ ideas became policy, China would almost certainly retaliate in some fashion. American exports, while sharply smaller than those China sends in the other direction, are a potential focus. Beijing has proved especially adept in the past at targeting American exports from swing states in presidential elections and closely fought congressional districts, maximizing its leverage in the political process even if the economic effects were limited. The biggest immediate casualty of tougher trade policies could be the Obama administration’s effort to strengthen relations with countries like Japan, Singapore and Vietnam as a way to balance China’s growing muscle in East Asia. The economic centerpiece of the administration’s   pivot to Asia has been the negotiation of the   Partnership. That agreement calls for dismantling barriers to American trade with many of the countries that find themselves increasingly uneasy about China’s growing dominance. Mr. Trump denounced the pact again on Tuesday, saying that it would force American workers to compete with   Vietnamese workers. Mrs. Clinton, after supporting the early negotiations as secretary of state, has come out against the pact since the fall, saying that the deal does not go far enough to address issues like currency manipulation. Yet canceling the trade pact could actually cause more problems, by pushing American allies in the region into China’s arms and preventing American companies from developing in emerging Asian markets. “If America kills the T. P. P. ,” said Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, “then China becomes the main center of economic gravity. ”",0,1173,20.57894736842105,57,0.37595907928388744,0,0,0,0,97.13536331848648,16.93340437624325,60.7617220801364,25.774193548387096,0.7612958226768969,0.023870417732310314,0.06479113384484228,0.02216538789428815,0.03665814151747655,0.011935208866155157,0.13981244671781756,0.005967604433077579,0.005115089514066497,0.017902813299232736,0.0784313725490196,0,0.04688832054560955,0.00937766410912191,0.0034100596760443308,0.015345268542199489,0.0076726342710997444,0.08695652173913043,0,0.05200341005967604,0.03751065643648764,0.0443307757885763,0,0.0025575447570332483,0.023017902813299233,0.020460358056265986,0.11508951406649616,0,0.0008525149190110827,0.004262574595055414,0.0076726342710997444,0,0.01278772378516624,0.0247229326513214,0.0017050298380221654,0.0017050298380221654,0.39215686274509803,0.004262574595055414,0.0076726342710997444,0.0034100596760443308,0,0.03580562659846547,0.0008525149190110827,0.0025575447570332483,0.017050298380221655,0.0025575447570332483,0.0025575447570332483,0.0068201193520886615,0.04603580562659847,0.023870417732310314,0.005115089514066497,0.017902813299232736,0.0008525149190110827,0,0.0068201193520886615,0.17476555839727195,0.0025575447570332483,0,0.013640238704177323,0.058823529411764705,0.11167945439045183,0.01875532821824382,0.017902813299232736,0.08269394714407502,0.1517476555839727,0.05456095481670929,0.0247229326513214,0,0.008525149190110827,0.13895993179880647,0,0.005967604433077579,0.0068201193520886615,0.004262574595055414,0.0017050298380221654,0,0,0.005967604433077579,0.05456095481670929,0.08013640238704177,0,0.0196078431372549,0.011935208866155157,0.0392156862745098,0.08525149190110827,0.09121909633418585,0,0.09718670076726342,0.0008525149190110827,28.125,0,77.0625,2,6.75,1,40.5,15,16.25,76.846875,29.075,27,25.625,8,28.125,0,113.825,45.5,163.3625,305.9375,113.825,,0.45444346801356056,0,0.69534433774248,0.05592233456385257,0.16660954208697232,0.02876548378601252,0.5453525551087163,0.3076046890535781,0.3249097658501426,0.6947504409411088,0.4626912066052501,0.4443428780322217,0.4314780375923696,0.19155305600199451,0.43504533801503203,0,0.08206930737686449,0.032806092560046865,0.11778649001847596,0.2205849218151503,-0.6747859125955628,0.7794150781848497,92
310,"First things first: “The Secret Life of Pets” is preceded by a short film starring the Minions, in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax, depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case, Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes, and it’s pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness. Part of the Minions’ ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language, but rather a chirpy, vaguely   patois. “The Secret Life of Pets,” Illumination’s newest feature, relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices, mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television.

It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy, sensitive   dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen. Similarly, Hannibal Buress (a dachshund) Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from “Broad City” or “Obvious Child” or “In a World” but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that! Fans of “Modern Family” will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after “Central Intelligence” and “Ride Along 2” will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write. There is also a guinea pig, some other birds, lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story, full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. “The Secret Life of Pets,” written by Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud, is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby, but with talking animals. Which is, all in all, pretty good fun.   cartoons generally are, if they have even a modest quantity of wit or   insight. And while this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of “Zootopia,” it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. As the title suggests, the conceit is that when we humans are away, our furry, scaly, feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one another’s apartments, they dance and flirt and play loud music and then, when we return, pretend that they’ve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats, of course, who make a great show of not caring. Here I should say that, while Ms. Bell’s purring vocalizations are beyond reproach, the film is clearly the work of dog people, and traffics  —   like nearly every other movie in its genre  —   in some tired   stereotypes. I could go on about this, but I’m not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And I’m not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But they’re also just too easy, with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat, pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters. Speaking of politics, the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Hart’s adorably fuzzy, implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie, of course, and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic, and if the story becomes a little too busy, it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slate’s Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less  . Everyone gets home safely. Like the “Despicable Me” movies, which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions) “The Secret Life of Pets” is adequate animated entertainment, amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting, a potential wonderland of glamour, filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a   set. “The Secret Life of Pets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect.

311,"Writing at the Guardian newspaper, global warming advocate Bill McKibben claimed that President Donald Trump and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon are “counting on” a terrorist “massacre” on American soil to “tilt things their way. ”[McKibben, who has contributed numerous opinion pieces to the Guardian, wrote a column titled “Donald Trump and Steve Bannon have turned the White House against America. ”  In the piece, McKibben claimed the White House, which he argued was acting more like a “Black Tower,” was “sending out its Breitbartian orcs and   winged harpies to poison the politics of a nation. ” He referred to Trump’s temporary halt on refugees while the U. S. revamps its flawed screening process as an “immigration ban,” which McKibben claimed was actually a “calculated assault” on Muslims, morality, and “on simple kindness. ” “It was a probe to find out if Americans would come to the defense of a minority that we’d been told to fear and hate,” he claimed.  “And it failed  —   not because a federal judge struck down the ban, but because Americans in their millions poured into airport baggage terminals and city squares. ” McKibben went on to charge that Trump and Bannon may be “counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. ” He wrote: The outpouring was not a show of Muslim strength  —   there really isn’t much Muslim strength in America. It was a demonstration that, for the moment, our moral commitment to the underdog still holds. But there are no guarantees: morality can bend pretty easily in the face of fear, and you know that Bannon and Trump are counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. And in any event, morality is the not the only pillar they’re after. Next on the list is reason: the attack on climate science is, in fact, an attack on science itself, on the enterprise that undergirds modernity. McKibben’s charge about a “Bowling Green massacre” referred to an error made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who mistakenly said that “President Obama had a   ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. ” In actuality, Obama’s State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two   members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U. S. troops in Iraq. McKibben is founder of 350. org, which bills itself as a grassroots group building a “global climate movement. ”  The group is funded by the George   Tides Foundation and a slew of   philanthropies. In a 2010 review of one of his books, Time magazine opined that McKibben “may be the world’s best green journalist. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

312,"Comments The conservative political machine has been working overtime to try to deny that the government of the Russian Federation is interfering with the American election in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump – but this explosive investigation by former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee proves once and for all that dictator Vladimir Putin is using every tool at his disposal to tilt the scale in favor of Trump. Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the “thinkfluencers,” members of Putin’s underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. “The reason I’m hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russia” said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are “lazy and they believe everything they read.”",1,165,41.25,4,0.3393939393939394,0,0,0,0,82.47841047841048,1.5115121806298275,90.87005649717514,36.42424242424242,0.696969696969697,0.024242424242424242,0.03636363636363636,0.03636363636363636,0.01818181818181818,0.012121212121212121,0.12121212121212122,0,0,0.012121212121212121,0.05454545454545454,0,0.05454545454545454,0,0,0.03636363636363636,0.024242424242424242,0.09696969696969697,0,0.030303030303030304,0.01818181818181818,0.06666666666666667,0.012121212121212121,0,0.006060606060606061,0,0.06666666666666667,0,0,0,0.03636363636363636,0,0,0.05454545454545454,0,0,0.42424242424242425,0,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.04242424242424243,0,0,0.03636363636363636,0.01818181818181818,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0,0.006060606060606061,0,0,0.01818181818181818,0.23030303030303031,0.006060606060606061,0,0.01818181818181818,0.024242424242424242,0.06666666666666667,0.07272727272727272,0.012121212121212121,0.030303030303030304,0.1393939393939394,0.11515151515151516,0.012121212121212121,0,0.03636363636363636,0.06060606060606061,0,0,0,0,0.012121212121212121,0,0,0.030303030303030304,0.14545454545454545,0.01818181818181818,0,0.006060606060606061,0.03636363636363636,0.030303030303030304,0.12727272727272726,0.14545454545454545,0,0.05454545454545454,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,0,5,0,11,0,0,6,0,0,1,6,3,18,27,6,,0,0,0.40149162409079436,0.2511664187323588,0,0,0,0.3585701736362871,0,0.551536804634372,0,0,0.40149162409079436,0,0,0.10056040392403998,0.03296703296703297,0.016483516483516484,0.0989010989010989,0.14835164835164835,-0.6548590014996047,0.8516483516483516,10
313,"In the battle against the Islamic State for Mosul, Iraq’s   city, there is no continuous front line, but a patchwork of battlegrounds in the city and all around its edge. When the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, retreats from a position, it tries to leave as much damage behind as possible, including burning oil field wells to provide concealment ahead of a government advance. Snipers are also in place, ready to strike. A village or neighborhood that is retaken by government troops could soon be flooded again with extremist fighters, who are rarely far away. I recently spent three weeks in this volatile zone, first with the Iraqi Army in eastern Mosul and then, after setbacks for the army, whose    battle of attrition was not going the way it had hoped, with units of the Iraqi federal police. The police, traveling in armored vehicles, are playing a significant role in the battle for Mosul, sometimes supporting the army. They are also responsible for holding their own territory around the city. The police have been tasked with maintaining areas of the front line nearby, ISIS fighters are ready and in position. When holding ground and not on an advance, the two sides intermittently exchange rifle and mortar fire,   shows of force that tend to harass more than inflict serious casualties. For the two days I was embedded with the police, they had been ordered to pause in their advance. So for the most part, they were left to wait along a muddy front until the next push forward. For the civilians trapped by the fighting, life is bleak, and most are desperate to leave. Areas along the contested front have no water, no electricity and no way for people to obtain basic supplies. Those trapped by the fighting and those who return hoping to restart their lives  —   or at least to recover some belongings  —   are at risk of being caught in the   and injuries and deaths among civilians are increasing. When government forces liberate an area, most civilians act quickly to try to evacuate. However, the Islamic State appears eager to keep as many civilians as possible in the urban center, using them as shields against aggressive bombing campaigns by the government and coalition forces. Anyone seen fleeing risks a sniper attack. Government troops sometimes escort families to safety, urging them to hurry through streets that offer little cover. Once civilians reach a safe zone, a more organized system is in place to transport them in buses and on the backs of trucks to camps for displaced people. On the way, they receive donations of food and water. Iraqi forces have been told to destroy evidence of the Islamic State after retaking an area, but signs of its control can sometimes be difficult to efface. Coalition   bombings destroyed an Islamic State training base in a former agricultural college in the town of Hamam Alil, below. But ISIS writing, which states the name of a unit, remains visible on the wall. Residents, like the women below in the town of Bashiqa, are starting to return to areas recently freed from the Islamic State to learn what became of their homes and to gather the few belongings that have not been looted or destroyed. The woman below was recovering a wedding photo from the rubble in Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul. The town, famous for its olive groves, was once a popular day trip destination from the city and had a large population of Yazidis. The Islamic State’s control of Mosul and the nearby area separated families for long stretches. The relatives below, reunited on the side of the road, had not seen one another in two years. The battle for Mosul has forced many tens of thousands from their homes, and displaced people are a common sight along the roads across the city. Early in my assignment, I accompanied the Iraqi Army to this neighborhood below, which is in the eastern part of Mosul, where civilians dared to venture outside as government troops patrolled. But just a few hours after this photo was taken, Islamic State fighters attacked an Iraqi Army field base nearby, killing soldiers, destroying their armored vehicles and almost immediately posting a YouTube video triumphantly showing their accomplishment. After that, access for photographers was severely curtailed by the army, and journalists quickly went from having a   seat to this very critical battle to struggling to get any information at all. Ambulances carrying those gravely injured from sniper fire, artillery, mortars and mines are driven out of Mosul in a steady flow en route to hospitals in nearby Erbil. When fighting is heavy, dozens of injured people arrive at the hospitals every hour. Field hospitals inside Mosul have few supplies, so victims must be evacuated to where they can be treated. Some do not survive the journey. The emergency vehicles offered me one of the most reliable indications of how the battle was going, and a chance to document the results. The government has been trying to consolidate its gains, first in the outer provincial villages, and now in suburbs and city districts ever closer to the city center. But the Islamic State had a long time to prepare for this battle, and its fighters are skilled and   taking full advantage of their underground network of tunnels throughout the region. A long and difficult fight lies ahead for Iraqi forces trying to liberate Mosul, like this lone federal policeman on a still very dangerous and shifting front line.",0,922,23.05,40,0.3199566160520607,0,0,0,0,97.55347313401556,56.019291395517,59.42446854663775,1.7786461656246004,0.8221258134490239,0.0227765726681128,0.04772234273318872,0.02928416485900217,0.057483731019522775,0.016268980477223426,0.11171366594360087,0.02928416485900217,0.004338394793926247,0.0021691973969631237,0.09869848156182212,0,0.05856832971800434,0.01193058568329718,0.0032537960954446853,0.01193058568329718,0.005422993492407809,0.06724511930585683,0,0.06399132321041215,0.027114967462039046,0.06073752711496746,0,0.004338394793926247,0.020607375271149676,0.004338394793926247,0.10954446854663774,0,0.004338394793926247,0.004338394793926247,0.0021691973969631237,0,0.009761388286334056,0.03470715835140998,0.0021691973969631237,0.0021691973969631237,0.46963123644251625,0.008676789587852495,0,0.007592190889370932,0.005422993492407809,0.031453362255965296,0,0.0032537960954446853,0.005422993492407809,0.014099783080260303,0.006507592190889371,0,0.0032537960954446853,0.026030368763557483,0.009761388286334056,0.04338394793926247,0,0,0.013015184381778741,0.1876355748373102,0.0021691973969631237,0,0.01843817787418655,0.04338394793926247,0.0509761388286334,0.0227765726681128,0.014099783080260303,0.055314533622559656,0.18112798264642083,0.05422993492407809,0.02386117136659436,0,0,0.19197396963123645,0.009761388286334056,0.014099783080260303,0.008676789587852495,0.0021691973969631237,0.01193058568329718,0,0,0,0.0596529284164859,0.1193058568329718,0,0.027114967462039046,0.01735357917570499,0.0509761388286334,0.09652928416485901,0.09761388286334056,0,0.021691973969631236,0,15,0,159.875,1,8.25,4,5,12.25,16.455,79.2025,11.25,13.025,13,18,15,1,62.73,9,247.6275,315.73249999999996,62.73,,0.34654620645552786,0,0.8496790986702791,0.03414802408943918,0.22581537056314327,0.12389934309929541,0.15022110482233483,0.3022134017215629,0.367797676206751,0.7368581182669977,0.2845632319761617,0.31530452139845666,0.3148898989175986,0.38890101355948364,0.6886167427885626,0.03414802408943918,0.054513103610091825,0.007821105252523936,0.21519119343548565,0.27437523490472365,-0.9023902194999939,0.7256247650952763,87
314,"Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. “I was very choked up,” Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. “How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  —   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  —   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation’s most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  —   in New York, Washington and Boston  —   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city’s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  —   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s Far West Side in 2015 was the city’s first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,” she said through tears. “This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. “Representation matters,” they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. “There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,” Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  —   just barely  —   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo’s voice came over the loudspeaker. “Rest assured: I’m not driving the train,” he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. “We’ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. “Hopefully, it’s almost ready for us. ” It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. “Would you look at that guy?” Mr. Braith, 77, said. “Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ” He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith’s mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. “Are you famous?” a   asked, seeing the hubbub. “In the jazz world,” Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, “Well, you’re immortalized as far as I’m concerned. ” Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life,” he said, seemingly speaking for many others.",0,1375,18.333333333333332,75,0.32072727272727275,0,0,0,0,97.59965468057953,60.64219114219114,68.16883116883116,40.12,0.7818181818181819,0.015272727272727273,0.05454545454545454,0.028363636363636365,0.024,0.006545454545454545,0.17527272727272727,0.0007272727272727272,0.002181818181818182,0.015272727272727273,0.10981818181818181,0,0.04872727272727273,0.009454545454545455,0.002909090909090909,0.008727272727272728,0.007272727272727273,0.05745454545454545,0.0014545454545454545,0.06763636363636363,0.02327272727272727,0.04363636363636364,0,0.0014545454545454545,0.014545454545454545,0.008727272727272728,0.06109090909090909,0,0.005090909090909091,0.005090909090909091,0.013818181818181818,0,0.0036363636363636364,0.04436363636363636,0.002181818181818182,0.002181818181818182,0.44145454545454543,0.004363636363636364,0.010181818181818183,0.0014545454545454545,0.008727272727272728,0.02909090909090909,0.0014545454545454545,0.0007272727272727272,0.011636363636363636,0.009454545454545455,0.007272727272727273,0.019636363636363636,0.004363636363636364,0.02909090909090909,0.008,0.007272727272727273,0.0007272727272727272,0.0007272727272727272,0.04,0.2290909090909091,0.006545454545454545,0,0.02618181818181818,0.06036363636363636,0.029818181818181817,0.04,0.015272727272727273,0.032,0.15636363636363637,0.06909090909090909,0.024727272727272726,0.002181818181818182,0.02181818181818182,0.21890909090909091,0.0007272727272727272,0.007272727272727273,0.007272727272727273,0.002909090909090909,0.010181818181818183,0,0.0007272727272727272,0.01890909090909091,0.072,0.11927272727272727,0,0.01309090909090909,0.005818181818181818,0.07272727272727272,0.09090909090909091,0.10618181818181818,0.0014545454545454545,0.015272727272727273,0.005090909090909091,30.9375,3,41.96875,3,12,12,8,0,47.375,47.575,7,42.2,14,2,30.9375,0,131.5125,31,104.86875,261.38125,131.5125,,0.4440746970291593,0.0718910130021613,0.5200679887983909,0.0718910130021613,0.23654719877941743,0.23654719877941743,0.17119684379985609,0,0.5502014009569723,0.5512437495277293,0.15307293882461695,0.5214393530140652,0.2655043469854589,0.04910405543058044,0.4739926516060445,0,0.08390587803701237,0.01977821286301594,0.0669069825864001,0.16676303228713502,0.4931299319519813,0.833236967712865,69
315,"Pop icon Cher left little to the imagination while performing some of her biggest hits at Sunday night’s Billboard Music Awards, the singer’s first awards show concert in 15 years. [The    icon performed her smash hits “Believe” and “If I Could Turn Back Time” Sunday night before accepting the ceremony’s Icon Award for her   career in the music industry.  The   and   danced on stage wearing a silver diamante dress, with her chest covered up by   nipple pasties. The sparkling dress, which consisted of multiple hanging diamond strips, barely covered the singers chest and groin area. She later returned to the stage in a black catsuit and a large   wig, a throwback to her early 80s look.  “So, I wanted to do what I do since I was 4 years old, and I’ve been doing it for 53 years,” Cher said in accepting the Icon Award. “That is not an applause thing, I’m 71 yesterday! And I can do a   plank, okay? Just saying. ” The singer steered clear of politics in her acceptance speech, focusing instead on the advice she received when she was younger and on something her mother told her before she became famous, that she would never be the “smartest,” the “prettiest,” or the “most talented,” but she would be “special. ” “I think luck has so much to do with with my success,” she continued. “I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in. ” Cher’s outfit drew plenty of commentary on social media and on television, including on Good Morning Britain, where host Piers Morgan said he was not a fan. “At what point do Cher’s outfits become inappropriate? She’s 70,” he said. “That one in particular, come on, Cher, for goodness’ sake, love. ”   Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

316,"If President Donald Trump’s promised border wall stops only a small fraction of illegal aliens from coming into the U. S. it would save the U. S. billions and easily cover the cost of the wall, a report released Thursday finds. [The   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) using the estimated education level of illegal alien border crossers and immigrant education estimates from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) found that each illegal alien entering the U. S. racks up at least $74, 722 in lifetime costs, funded by American taxpayers.  “[I]f a border wall stopped a small fraction of the illegal immigrants who are expected to come in the next decade, the fiscal savings from having fewer illegal immigrants in the country would be sufficient to cover the costs of the wall,” writes CIS Director of Research Steven Camarota.  Even a minimally effective border wall that stopped less than ten percent of illegal crossings would save the U. S. billions. “If a border wall stopped between 160, 000 and 200, 000 illegal crossers —  nine to 12 percent of those expected to successfully cross in the next decade —  the scaled savings would equal the $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall,” Camarota writes. Approximately 170, 000 illegal aliens crossed into the U. S. without going through a port of entry in 2015, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “If a wall stopped half of those expected to successfully enter illegally without going through a port of entry at the southern border over the next 10 years, it would save taxpayers nearly $64 billion —  several times the wall’s cost,” the report adds. And that’s excluding the cost of children produced by illegal immigrants. The federal government imposes a massive, unfunded mandate on school districts around the country by forcing American parents to divert funding from their own children to educate roughly 3. 62 million foreign students, many of whom are extremely   students and do not speak English. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) found it costs taxpayers $59. 8 billion per year to educate roughly 3. 62 million   students, children with one or two legal migrant parents, and refugees. Approximately one in ten students enrolled in public schools is designated as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and their academic performance has been described as “abominable”: The number of eighth to twelfth grade LEP students performing Advanced work rounds to zero percent, for example. The CIS report notes that the estimates do not include illegal aliens who overstay their visas, and state and local governments bear a significant portion of illegal immigration’s costs.",0,511,16.483870967741936,31,0.3835616438356164,0,0,0,0,98.21128348599714,13.860177543322274,50.782778864970645,66.51146211909422,0.7690802348336595,0.015655577299412915,0.03913894324853229,0.01761252446183953,0.021526418786692758,0.003913894324853229,0.17416829745596868,0,0,0.007827788649706457,0.0958904109589041,0,0.0410958904109589,0.0019569471624266144,0,0.005870841487279843,0.003913894324853229,0.08023483365949119,0.0019569471624266144,0.043052837573385516,0.0136986301369863,0.03522504892367906,0,0,0.023483365949119372,0.029354207436399216,0.07436399217221135,0,0.003913894324853229,0,0,0,0.015655577299412915,0.019569471624266144,0,0,0.3835616438356164,0.0019569471624266144,0.0019569471624266144,0,0.0019569471624266144,0.03522504892367906,0.009784735812133072,0,0.007827788649706457,0.005870841487279843,0,0,0.029354207436399216,0.0136986301369863,0.007827788649706457,0,0.009784735812133072,0,0.09197651663405088,0.2446183953033268,0.029354207436399216,0.007827788649706457,0.0019569471624266144,0.060665362035225046,0.10176125244618395,0.01761252446183953,0.021526418786692758,0.03718199608610567,0.14481409001956946,0.05283757338551859,0.029354207436399216,0,0.023483365949119372,0.14090019569471623,0,0.011741682974559686,0.015655577299412915,0,0,0,0,0,0.025440313111545987,0.08610567514677103,0,0.033268101761252444,0.005870841487279843,0.0410958904109589,0.07632093933463796,0.08610567514677103,0,0.07632093933463796,0.009784735812133072,20,0,59.8,0,3.83,0,3,40.2,0,62.1,4,1,6,0,20,0,34.83,3,81.1,118.92999999999999,34.83,,0.4454362905434059,0,0.7060229252921298,0,0.13331106054288916,0,0.1075276556267306,0.617513425486633,0,0.7137947509523823,0.13840926619852625,0.038610337957960365,0.19417601913675478,0,0.1672252033275417,0,0.0590409031580018,0.005085349109216348,0.13747393758581528,0.2016001898530334,-0.7243629578507189,0.7983998101469666,40
317,"Email In September the National ICE Council, representing some 5,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers charged with protecting the country’s borders, did something it has never done: It endorsed a candidate for president: Donald Trump. In its statement at the time, the union said: In [Trump’s] immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security — including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory retainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. On the contrary, said the union, Hillary Clinton supports furthering “amnesty” and a “radical” immigration plan that will cost thousands of Americans not only their jobs but their lives . On Friday the union issued a “final warning,” expanding its concern about how open borders would cost Americans their lives. Wrote the council’s president, Chris Crane: Hillary’s pledge for ‘open borders’ will mean disaster for our country, and turn the present border emergency into a cataclysm. Hillary’s plan would unleash violent cartels and brutal transnational gangs into US communities and cause countless preventable deaths…. ICE officers on the front lines are witnessing a deluge of illegal immigration unlike anything we have seen before. The corporate-funded media won’t cover it. Our officers are being ordered to release recent border-crossers with no idea what their intentions are or what they are planning. Gang members, drug cartels and violent smugglers are taking advantage of the situation and threatening American communities. The influx is overwhelming public resources, especially in poor communities — including Hispanic communities and immigrant communities bearing the economic brunt of the illegal immigration surge. There are economic, cultural, and moral reasons for concerns about open borders, as noted by economist Gene Callahan. Unlimited immigration would likely lead to lower wages for Americans who would have to cut their wage demands or be replaced by immigrant workers willing to work for lower wages. Culturally an unlimited dumping of immigrants onto an unprepared and unsuspecting culture would alter that culture irreparably. Consider the Native American culture, he said: If Native Americans had been able to limit the flow of European immigrants, they might have been able to preserve their land and cultures. Morally there is a responsibility to take care of those less able to care for themselves but not to the point of reducing their own circumstances to penury: While the rich have an obligation to help the poor, that obligation does not extend to the degree that they must become poor themselves. Since every resident in the United States, except maybe for those Native Americans, is either an immigrant or a descendent of one, it makes sense to welcome immigrants. Until 1875, there were no immigration laws. But with the passage of the Page Act of 1875, legislators began defining the procedures under which those desiring to immigrate into the country would have to follow. Since then immigration laws have been heavily modified, but they have always defined those procedures and conditions. If the laws need to be changed again, then legislators should change them. But they must be followed, not ignored for political purposes. Otherwise, unintended consequences, such as those noted in the ICE Council’s warning, will overtake the culture and risk destroying the very culture that makes it presently so inviting for those seeking a better life.

318,"In the winding hallways and stuffy rooms of an old factory in Brooklyn, under bulbs flickering as if in a horror movie, an elite new police unit prepares, over and over again, for the attack it knows is coming. Day after day, the officers comb the highest floor of the building, looking for witnesses to point them to the right door and listening for gunshots like those that have echoed all over the world in recent months. They are conducting exercises to help them hunt down an “active shooter. ” “It’s going to happen,” said Chief James R. Waters, who leads the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau. “Something like Orlando’s going to happen. ” Last year, the police announced the creation of a heavily armed and armored regiment called the Critical Response Command. Teams of officers work all over the city and are trained to respond to many locations in three to five minutes. They represent a new response to a new threat. Gone are the days when the first officers on a scene set up a perimeter and waited for backup or a   team. The perpetrators of the most recent wave of mass shootings around the world  —   Paris San Bernardino, Calif. Orlando, Fla.  —   were not interested in taking hostages and negotiating. They came to kill for the sake of killing. And these officers are trained to find and stop them. On Thursday, Chief Waters allowed journalists from The New York Times to watch the Critical Response Command train. “This is seven months of work,” he said, standing before a team of officers in bulletproof vests who were cradling Colt M4 semiautomatic rifles. “It’s incredible progress. ” The officers were practicing in a former pharmaceutical factory on Flushing Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood. The Police Department is not listed among the building’s tenants, but it has worked there since before the command’s creation. The journalists were allowed to observe the exercises under restrictions. A photographer and videographer were forbidden to document the command as it moved in drills, and a reporter was asked to describe the tactics only in broad strokes. Department leaders believe terrorists study descriptions of police training in preparation for attacks. “The perpetrators in France demonstrated a familiarity with the French response,” Deputy Chief Scott Shanley said, referring to the coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 130 people in November. The officers, who also played the roles of gunmen and bystanders, conducted two exercises. The first began with a dispatcher’s call: shots fired in the building. Officers in a patrol car would typically be the first to respond in this situation, and that was the case in the drill. Two officers, clutching pistols, entered the hallway, crouching, one in front and the other behind him with a hand on the first officer’s back. Officers in the command do not know the details of an exercise beforehand. Suddenly, a man ran toward them, screaming for help. The officers ordered him to his knees and asked about the gunman the man pointed down the hall. The officers hurried around a corner. Gunfire rang out. “Shots fired!” the rear officer shouted into his radio, and the pair ran to the sound. A masked gunman, wearing green fatigues in a room with cubicles, opened fire. The officers fired back. Rounds with a chalklike substance, similar to paintballs, struck the gunman. He fell to the floor. The rear officer shouted “Loading! Loading! Loading!” and ejected a spent magazine from his pistol, sliding in a new one. The other officer bent and took the gunman’s pulse. Dead. They called for backup and waited. What followed was an extraordinary show of paramilitary precision and force. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to seeing heavily armed officers standing in subway stations and at city landmarks. They have not seen what journalists were allowed to see on Thursday  —   a response to an   scene from within the scene itself. The door through which the first responding officers had entered crept open again, and a head popped out. Then the entire team emerged, six officers in this case, moving fast in single file, each touching the back of the man before him. They seemed to move as a single organism, like a long black snake darting across the hall to the closest door. There was no hesitation at the door, no peeking inside. The officers burst through and moved in different directions. “A dynamic entry,” Capt. Eugene McCarthy said, watching. “The perpetrator’s processing is disrupted by dynamic entry,” Deputy Chief John O’Connell said, standing beside him. To demonstrate, the command later allowed journalists to stand in an empty room and wait for the team to enter. The silence was startling, unnerving. The officers did not speak as they snaked toward the room. They communicated in pats on the back and hand signals. There was no warning of their arrival. One moment, the room was empty. A heartbeat later, it was filled with the six men and their guns. Traditionally, when officers stormed a room, the first one was known as the “rabbit,” likely drawing the fire of the gunman inside while the second officer took aim at him. With this team, it was as if there were no rabbit  —   the entire team seemed to swarm the room at once. In the exercise, the team joined the first two officers near the dead gunman, until they all heard more gunfire down the hall. The team regrouped into its line and raced toward the shots. The officer in front fired at a gunman, and others behind him stepped out of the line and did the same, and in what seemed like a second, that gunman was down and the drill over. The officers pulled off their helmets, sweating after minutes of intense action. Captain McCarthy stepped forward and ran through a quick review. The officer who played the second gunman praised the speed and accuracy of the officers who shot him. “No    issues,” he said. “Good job. ” An officer who played a victim, with fake blood on his leg, said: “No shots on me. Good job. ” The officers switched roles and prepared to do it again, the details of the drill different this time. The strategy, though, was constant. “Move to the shooter,” Chief Waters said. “You’ll hear it 50 times. Move to the shooter. It’s got to be ingrained. Like muscle memory. ” The Critical Response Command is made up of 525 handpicked officers and superiors who applied and were chosen after a screening process that included   interviews with Chief Waters and others. Their training must override lifelong human instinct. “It goes against all their upbringing,” Chief Waters said. “They have to walk past and run past victims on the ground. Kids crying. They’re grabbing at your legs. ” The training is always evolving with world events. The command recently introduced suicide belts into exercises. Chief Waters declined to elaborate. The visit on Thursday concluded with directions through more hallways to the elevator. There, waiting, one could hear, from behind, more gunfire.",0,1185,12.606382978723405,94,0.3333333333333333,0,0,0,0,98.85316500017728,47.27144866385373,70.55463407536737,7.936708860759494,0.8118143459915612,0.02531645569620253,0.039662447257383965,0.018565400843881856,0.032067510548523206,0.012658227848101266,0.1848101265822785,0.008438818565400843,0.004219409282700422,0.01181434599156118,0.12995780590717299,0,0.04219409282700422,0.016877637130801686,0.009282700421940928,0.01350210970464135,0.008438818565400843,0.05232067510548523,0.0016877637130801688,0.05822784810126582,0.029535864978902954,0.046413502109704644,0,0.005063291139240506,0.015189873417721518,0.004219409282700422,0.10717299578059072,0.0033755274261603376,0,0.00590717299578059,0,0,0.006751054852320675,0.059915611814345994,0.0008438818565400844,0.0008438818565400844,0.4582278481012658,0.008438818565400843,0.017721518987341773,0.010970464135021098,0.0008438818565400844,0.03459915611814346,0.0016877637130801688,0,0.009282700421940928,0.010970464135021098,0.018565400843881856,0.015189873417721518,0.0008438818565400844,0.029535864978902954,0.009282700421940928,0.02362869198312236,0.0016877637130801688,0,0.02531645569620253,0.19662447257383966,0.0033755274261603376,0,0.03291139240506329,0.0759493670886076,0.059915611814345994,0.030379746835443037,0.008438818565400843,0.07341772151898734,0.1620253164556962,0.06497890295358649,0.012658227848101266,0,0.030379746835443037,0.19662447257383966,0,0.005063291139240506,0.0033755274261603376,0.0033755274261603376,0.009282700421940928,0,0,0.01181434599156118,0.07763713080168777,0.11054852320675106,0,0.009282700421940928,0.016033755274261603,0.06244725738396625,0.10548523206751055,0.11139240506329114,0,0.032067510548523206,0.0016877637130801688,28.15,0,127.83500000000001,7,8,0,4,17,4.73,61,13.75,4,8,0,28.15,6,58.61,14,195.835,261.44499999999994,58.61,,0.39365692539852687,0,0.7467260815695268,0.13900205758683953,0.15576637346853567,0,0.08446130209733389,0.2816482936612691,0.09835936009810659,0.5845209269859785,0.24076779489996938,0.08446130209733389,0.15576637346853567,0,0.3923823629251941,0.12155846023001388,0.04292373548550107,0.010253067681232126,0.14342210781100667,0.19147237713712376,-0.8173778154222704,0.8085276228628763,81
319,"Share on Twitter The man who obliterated Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star says on video that he just did it to 'help' people. The man, who identified himself to Deadline Hollywood as Jamie Otis, pretended to be a construction worker to give himself cover at 5:30 Wednesday morning, as he took a pickaxe and sledgehammer to the terrazzo and cement star. Trump earned the star, which is situated on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theater, in 2007 for his work on “Celebrity Apprentice.” But in just a few minutes it was destroyed: Image Credit: Screengrab/ Deadline Hollywood Now the man has reappeared on video admitting the vandalism, but says he did it for an altruistic cause: “I really wanted to do this. I think it's a symbol for all of us against sexual assault.” He said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims. The man, a self-proclaimed activist, admitted in an exclusive TMZ interview that this isn't his first rodeo: “I'm a non violent activist. I've been arrested 24, 25 times. I'd love to go to court with Mr. Trump, it would be a great honor.” Without irony, the man claimed that Trump is “a bully” and that he needs to “ease up.” This isn't the first time Trump's star has been the target of vandals. Recently, the star was surrounded by a cement box: Image Credit: Screengrab/ YouTube Unfortunately for Mr. Otis, police are currently looking for him, with the possibility that he'll be charged with a felony. Additionally, the star he destroyed in the name of justice is worth $30,000.

320,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Two European satellites have captured a stunning portrait of the subtle topographical shifts at work in the landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Sentinel satellites, operated by the European Space Agency, have been snapping radar scans of the region since 2015 as part of their mission to collect data on the earth and oceans. Analysts have since compared the movement of physical features over time  —   down to mere millimeters. Among the project’s starkest depictions are shifts along the Hayward Fault, the gradual sinking of reclaimed land in the San Rafael Bay, and the rise of the city of Pleasanton, a possible side effect of replenished groundwater. The images align with already understood geological processes, said Roland Bürgmann, a professor of earth and planetary science at U. C. Berkeley, who was not involved in the project. But scientists believe that the acute level of detail offered by the technology could deepen knowledge in a number of areas, among them structural engineering, earthquake prediction and insurance risk. “It’s developing a new potential for the world that has never existed,” said Dag Anders Moldestad, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project. In the case of the Millennium Tower, it could also become a factor in a court fight as San Francisco wages a legal battle that accuses the developers of failing to disclose issues with the structural integrity of the downtown skyscraper. The Sentinel satellite images  —   captured from early 2015 to September of this year  —   show that the   luxury condominium building is sinking into the soft soil below at a rate of nearly two inches a year. A separate examination this year found that the tower had descended about 16 inches altogether, while tilting roughly six inches, since opening its doors in 2009. The developer has insisted that the building is safe. Nicholas Sitar, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said that a small amount of sinking was to be expected among structures on the reclaimed land along San Francisco’s waterfront. The Sentinel satellites, for example, found that the new Salesforce East tower, across the street from the Millennium Tower, was also sinking. The rapid rate of the Millennium Tower’s descent, however, was troubling, Dr. Sitar said.

About a dozen readers wrote to point out the error: the towering rock in the photograph was Yosemite Valley’s Half Dome, not Sentinel Dome as the caption claimed. That made us wonder if it might be time for a visit. While summer tends to be the park’s busiest time of the year, Yosemite regulars will tell you it is never more blissfully serene than in the winter. Crucially, it’s much less crowded. In the summer, up to 600, 000 people visit each month, said Scott Gediman, a park spokesman. During the winter months, it’s usually fewer than 200, 000. “The park is beautiful right now,” said Mr. Gediman, speaking by phone from the Yosemite Valley on Tuesday. “Yosemite Falls is flowing. You’ve got ice on the canyon walls. It’s just gorgeous and peaceful. ” Most of Yosemite is cloaked by snow in the winter, including at times the valley, which sits about 4, 000 feet above sea level. Visitors can ice skate, snowshoe,   ski or even hit the slopes. Established in 1935, Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area, formerly known as Badger Pass, is California’s oldest ski area. According to Frank Dean, a former park ranger who lived in the valley for eight years, Yosemite in the winter offers pageants of nature that you don’t get the rest of the year. He recalled once going   skiing with some friends on New Year’s Eve. The sky had just cleared after a storm and a bright moon was illuminating a dusting of snow on the valley’s soaring granite walls. As the group passed by the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel, a onetime host of Queen Elizabeth II, they noticed a holiday celebration inside. “We couldn’t afford to go to that party,” said Mr. Dean, who now runs the Yosemite Conservancy. “But I was thinking, ‘Boy, I think we’re having the better deal out here. ’” California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

322,"Vladimir Putin at the Valdai International Discussion Club : «Shaping the World of Tomorrow» by Vladimir Putin Voltaire Network | Sochi (Russia) | 27 October 2016 français русский Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion.Our esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case.But I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest.I think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow, is very topical.Last year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed.The tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed.I think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries’ elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature.But some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.In their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.We may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely.If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.Thus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said.At the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out.But they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders.Of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe.It is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims.Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.The question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?Sad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood.Sociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy.Yes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power.People sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite’s vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside.At first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities’ labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda.Friends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet.As for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority – we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem.By the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt – who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you’ll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain.This begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.People are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item – from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck – can be used to carry out a mass killing.Moreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures – they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us.The terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises.But this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake.We all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow.We all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia’s calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What’s more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose.Colleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter.Today it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models.We have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone.In our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today.There are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won’t be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners.It is necessary to add to the international agenda the issue of restoring the Middle Eastern countries’ lasting statehood, economy and social sphere. The mammoth scale of destruction demands drawing up a long-term comprehensive programme, a kind of Marshall Plan, to revive the war- and conflict-ridden area. Russia is certainly willing to join actively in these team efforts.We cannot achieve global stability unless we guarantee global economic progress. It is essential to provide conditions for creative labour and economic growth at a pace that would put an end to the division of the world into permanent winners and permanent losers. The rules of the game should give the developing economies at least a chance to catch up with those we know as developed economies. We should work to level out the pace of economic development, and brace up backward countries and regions so as to make the fruit of economic growth and technological progress accessible to all. Particularly, this would help to put an end to poverty, one of the worst contemporary problems.It is also absolutely evident that economic cooperation should be mutually lucrative and rest on universal principles to enable every country to become an equal partner in global economic activities. True, the regionalising trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the medium term. However, regional trade agreements should complement and expand not replace the universal norms and regulations.Russia advocates the harmonisation of regional economic formats based on the principles of transparency and respect for each other’s interests. That is how we arrange the work of the Eurasian Economic Union and conduct negotiations with our partners, particularly on coordination with the Silk Road Economic Belt project, which China is implementing. We expect it to promote an extensive Eurasian partnership, which promises to evolve into one of the formative centres of a vast Eurasian integration area. To implement this idea, 5+1 talks have begun already for an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between all participants in the process.An important task of ours is to develop human potential. Only a world with ample opportunities for all, with highly skilled workers, access to knowledge and a great variety of ways to realise their potential can be considered truly free. Only a world where people from different countries do not struggle to survive but lead full lives can be stable.A decent future is impossible without environment protection and addressing climate problems. That is why the conservation of the natural world and its diversity and reducing the human impact on the environment will be a priority for the coming decades.Another priority is global healthcare. Of course, there are many problems, such as large-scale epidemics, decreasing the mortality rate in some regions and the like. So there is enormous room for advancement. All people in the world, not only the elite, should have the right to healthy, long and full lives. This is a noble goal. In short, we should build the foundation for the future world today by investing in all priority areas of human development. And of course, it is necessary to continue a broad-based discussion of our common future so that all sensible and promising initiatives are heard.Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that you, as members of the Valdai Club, will actively take part in this work.

323,"Users across Chinese social media expressed their anger and called for a boycott over a viral video of an Asian doctor being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight this week. [The Wall Street Journal reports that China’s own Twitter clone and microblogging service Weibo lit up on Sunday night after the video was posted to the social media service. Within hours, the incident was the number one trending topic on the platform with 100, 000 comments and nearly 160 million views by Tuesday.  Many of the comments across Weibo focused on what many believed to be discrimination against the man based on his ethnicity. Chinese author Song Hongbing wrote, “This is inherent arrogance  …    I don’t think a    white doctor would be treated like this. ” Other Weibo users discussed boycotting the airline. Wang Guanxiong, a   investor, also posted his disapproval of the company on Weibo, saying, “Overselling is the responsibility of the airlines. Why was it an Asian who got beaten? This is purely racial discrimination  …    boycott United Airlines. ” Oscar Munoz, the CEO of United Airlines apologized for the incident in an online statement, but later an internal memo reportedly sent to United employees was leaked that stated, “Our employees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this,” China is quite a large market for United Airlines, who have operated in the country for more than 30 years, providing more nonstop routes to and from China than competitors such as American Airlines or Delta. The incident on United Airlines has sparked such a response from Chinese travellers due in part to the rise of China’s middle class, according to Linda Du, general manager at consultancy APCO Worldwide. “International travel is now really common for people, either for business or personal pleasure,” said Du. “[Chinese consumers] want equal treatment, a good experience and to be respected. They have a sense of protecting  . ” Du also noted the use of social media to express anger over the incident as an example of the Chinese public using new media to make their voices heard: “In China, most of the traditional media is regulated by the Chinese government, so social media —  the   voice —  is the only resource they have. ” In February is was reported that Weibo had 313 million active users each month, just slightly behind Twitter’s 319 million active monthly users. The service, which was developed as a clone of Twitter only for use in China, is expected to outgrow Jack Dorsey’s social media platform this year.

324,"America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn, TIME, November 1, 2016 “A nation without borders,” Donald Trump has warned us , “is not a nation at all.” Trump was explaining the logic of the multi-billion dollar wall he promises to build along the U.S.-Mexican border, but he was hardly the first to make the case. Years ago, Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration, and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the high-flown rhetoric. Tee-shirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan. {snip} {snip} For much of its early history, the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war, conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked. There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended. Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed (like the U.S.-Mexican War), while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba, Central America and Hawaii. What’s more, the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous. Until well into the nineteenth century, immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens; indeed, for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was. The only international migration policed was the African slave trade, which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores. {snip} It is easy, when politics and ethnocentrism serve, to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself, while the borders are, in fact, regularly traversed by policy makers, investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick. Trump himself regularly touts, though refuses to reveal, his international dealings, many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they don’t outright violate American laws. Truth is that the nation’s prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrants–voluntary and involuntary, free and slave–and that those who most loudly denounce a “nation without borders” are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins, faith and lifeways at some point in the past. We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours, where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance, a nation’s security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospects–and thereby creating political allies–of working people around the world.",1,463,33.07142857142857,14,0.38444924406047515,0,0,0,0,84.94305843287638,49.668826493880495,56.0075161987041,58.458880212659906,0.8012958963282938,0.017278617710583154,0.047516198704103674,0.04967602591792657,0.04967602591792657,0.01079913606911447,0.15982721382289417,0.012958963282937365,0.0021598272138228943,0.008639308855291577,0.09503239740820735,0.0021598272138228943,0.07127429805615551,0.0064794816414686825,0.004319654427645789,0.019438444924406047,0.017278617710583154,0.12311015118790497,0,0.06263498920086392,0.019438444924406047,0.0755939524838013,0.01079913606911447,0.004319654427645789,0.032397408207343416,0.008639308855291577,0.0755939524838013,0,0,0,0,0,0.004319654427645789,0.04535637149028078,0,0,0.47516198704103674,0,0.0064794816414686825,0,0,0.0367170626349892,0.01079913606911447,0.0021598272138228943,0.012958963282937365,0.023758099352051837,0.0021598272138228943,0.01079913606911447,0.01511879049676026,0.01511879049676026,0.019438444924406047,0.01511879049676026,0.004319654427645789,0.004319654427645789,0.017278617710583154,0.20302375809935205,0.02159827213822894,0.0021598272138228943,0.01511879049676026,0.038876889848812095,0.056155507559395246,0.03455723542116631,0.032397408207343416,0.04319654427645788,0.12742980561555076,0.07127429805615551,0.02159827213822894,0,0.012958963282937365,0.183585313174946,0.0021598272138228943,0.008639308855291577,0.008639308855291577,0,0.008639308855291577,0.0021598272138228943,0,0.01079913606911447,0.05399568034557235,0.12958963282937366,0,0.04535637149028078,0.01079913606911447,0.038876889848812095,0.09071274298056156,0.09719222462203024,0.008639308855291577,0.038876889848812095,0.004319654427645789,9,0,58.4,0,9,10,3,10.7,1.7,22,9,5,5,0,9,1,36.7,13,89.10000000000001,135.10000000000002,36.7,,0.34974273756851054,0,0.7772862008740289,0,0.34974273756851054,0.3740666961489728,0.15202805015514587,0.39003834015039673,0.09222489589750846,0.5679881780637586,0.34974273756851054,0.23006275550355904,0.23006275550355904,0,0.5788609951579327,0.05639139975154663,0.06517492452495116,0.023086485526549457,0.1582312200319659,0.23992186112591016,-0.8157907246757798,0.7600781388740898,35
325,"The international community should not only act against Venezuela’s socialist dictatorship as a matter of principle, but to protect the world from a growing web of criminal influence to which Venezuela belongs  —   alongside Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea. [So argues Diego Arria, a lifelong Venezuelan diplomat and former president of the UN Security Council who now advocates for the freedom of his country. In an interview with Breitbart News, conducted in both Spanish and English, Arria argues that the socialist Venezuelan government’s ties to terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue states make it a threat to the global community, not merely its Latin American neighbors.  “Venezuela is a risk to international peace and security,” Arria argued. “Venezuela has extremely dangerous ties to groups in the Middle East, to Hezbollah, for example. Some say, ‘Iran’s missiles can never reach the continental United States,’ and I say, ‘yes, but if they are in Venezuela, they can reach Miami directly. ’” “We are associated with the worst causes of humanity,” Arria lamented. “We were with [former Iranian president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad in Iran, we had ties to [late Iraqi dictator Saddam] Hussein, we had them with [late Libyan dictator Muammar] Qaddafi, we have them with the Palestinians. Never have there been in Venezuela so many Palestinians serving in high positions in the Venezuelan political hierarchy. ” Venezuela may serve “not only as an occupation site for the Cubans,” Arria argues, “but for the Chinese, the Russians, the Indians, the Palestinians  …     [this] turns Venezuela into an agitation center that is potentially very serious, and the United States has never given this the stature and importance that it should have for them. ” Arria also noted that Venezuela has close ties to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) a Marxist   organization that in 2015 was considered the wealthiest   terrorist organization in the world, surpassed in wealth only by the Islamic State and Hamas. “The relationship between Venezuela and the FARC in Colombia is extremely dangerous in my estimation because the FARC will soon be the most important and richest political party in Latin America. Those who do not enter the [President Juan Manuel] Santos pacification process will make of Venezuela an even greater drug and weapons transporting site than it is today. ” The “peace deal” between Santos’ government and the FARC will allow the terrorist group to evolve into a political party, and most FARC members are likely to avoid prison time for their crimes. The government of dictator Nicolás Maduro maintains the close ties with Iran that his predecessor Hugo Chávez cultivated, ties so close that Ahmadinejad risked a violation of sharia law to embrace Chávez’s mother at his funeral and declared he would return to earth alongside Jesus Christ and the Imam Mahdi, the Shiite Muslim figure believed to be in hiding until the prophesied end of the world. The ties between Venezuela and Iran  —   and its terror proxy, Hezbollah  —   are so close that multiple reports have accused Venezuela of selling legal documents (birth certificates, passports, etc) to   citizen Shiite terrorists to grant them easier access to the Western hemisphere than their Middle Eastern passports would allow. Maduro has also kept ties with Palestinian leaders and Syrian dictator Bashar   whose   SANA news agency regularly publishes friendly diplomatic notes from Maduro. Maduro has enjoyed economic and political support from China and Russia, and North Korea’s state newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, regularly publishes announcements that dictator Kim   has received accolades from socialist officials in the Latin American country. Venezuela’s closest ally, however, is Cuba  —   a communist state with a history of gross disregard for human rights that has killed U. S. citizens engaging in humanitarian efforts and embraced U. S. fugitive murderers as “revolutionaries. ” Asked about the role the United States can play in weakening Venezuela’s socialist tyranny, Arria suggests there is little outside sanctions and frozen assets that the international community can do. “The United States is playing a very interesting role, imposing sanctions on people tied to the regime, but they can do much more important things like following the money,” he proposed. “The United States and the Europeans know perfectly where the money is that people tied to the regime keep” and can freeze it, he added, noting that Republican legislators like Florida’s Ileana   and Marco Rubio and New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez have proposed such measures. Should the international community act to freeze Chavista assets worldwide, they will count on a Latin America more convinced than ever of the evil of Maduro’s regime. “There is a political change in Latin America, the countries who were the primary accomplices of the tyranny in Venezuela  —   Brazil with Lula [da Silva] Argentina with [Cristina Fernández de] Kirchner  —   [those governments] are not there anymore,” Arria noted. “That has been of great importance because now we have two of the largest Latin American nations supporting our efforts to recapture liberty. This is a notable change. ” Even Mexico, Arria added, a nation with what he identified as a “very accommodating policy of ” has “broken with this policy and categorically pronounced itself on Venezuela. ” “Today we have Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, about 90 percent of Latin America repudiates and condemns the Venezuelan regime,” he noted. With the support of the Organization of American State (OAS) and a few unforced errors from the Maduro regime, Arria sees an unprecedented chance to recapture the country from the socialists. “This is the largest peaceful insurrection in the history of Venezuela,” he notes. “In Latin America, we have never seen for 42 days straight 1, 000 protests, 20 daily. And it is not just in Caracas, it is in many towns. Every time they kill a young [protester] more mothers, fathers, siblings show up. ” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0,965,25.394736842105264,38,0.38860103626943004,0,0,0,0,90.62343022745236,7.926901651706439,72.94663212435233,25.774193548387096,0.7160621761658031,0.008290155440414507,0.046632124352331605,0.03730569948186528,0.05906735751295337,0.029015544041450778,0.18756476683937823,0.012435233160621761,0.00932642487046632,0.012435233160621761,0.09015544041450778,0.0010362694300518134,0.06528497409326425,0.0031088082901554403,0,0.011398963730569948,0.010362694300518135,0.058031088082901555,0,0.06632124352331606,0.02694300518134715,0.0538860103626943,0,0.004145077720207254,0.016580310880829015,0.0062176165803108805,0.10259067357512953,0,0.004145077720207254,0.0031088082901554403,0.002072538860103627,0,0.007253886010362694,0.016580310880829015,0.004145077720207254,0.004145077720207254,0.43730569948186526,0.0031088082901554403,0.002072538860103627,0.0010362694300518134,0.002072538860103627,0.039378238341968914,0.0051813471502590676,0,0.007253886010362694,0.007253886010362694,0.0062176165803108805,0.010362694300518135,0.007253886010362694,0.00932642487046632,0.010362694300518135,0.029015544041450778,0.004145077720207254,0,0.007253886010362694,0.15854922279792746,0.025906735751295335,0.0031088082901554403,0.008290155440414507,0.04041450777202073,0.061139896373056994,0.03419689119170984,0.029015544041450778,0.05181347150259067,0.12538860103626942,0.07357512953367876,0.01865284974093264,0,0.039378238341968914,0.11502590673575129,0.008290155440414507,0.0062176165803108805,0.011398963730569948,0,0.0031088082901554403,0,0,0.00932642487046632,0.07875647668393783,0.07564766839378238,0,0.008290155440414507,0.011398963730569948,0.031088082901554404,0.08808290155440414,0.08290155440414508,0.00932642487046632,0.035233160621761656,0.002072538860103627,38.40375,0,105.45,1,34,24.25,9,58.9,8.3,132.575,39,39.675,39.075,0,38.40375,1,155.45375,33.25,281.1,454.87875,155.45375,,0.5821233064234933,0,0.7927492723062436,0.035004081033175816,0.552234052671376,0.46798321760160383,0.24611616721299556,0.6811760834353084,0.2314034079736912,0.8278533515722661,0.5858662251471257,0.5900233848914149,0.5863322904153558,0,0.528493337717901,0.035004081033175816,0.11777881112185494,0.025191707950446205,0.21297410841715575,0.34463677061245207,-0.8656909855652725,0.655363229387548,100
326,"In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida, Carol City, the   star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream: He bought a Checkers   franchise. Why a Checkers? One reason seemed to rise above them all. “The No. 1 fries in the game,” Mr. Ross says in a   video released in December. The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck, puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community, which is in the Miami area. At a certain point, Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager, across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked. There was a McDonald’s that was closer, but Checkers, he says, was more affordable. “I made $30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night,” Mr. Ross says. “I went to Checkers. ” Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements. But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer, he seemed so genuine in his affection for the   chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a  . Still, it did not want a typical campaign. Scott Wakeman, director of marketing for Checkers   Restaurants Inc. and the company’s ad firm, Fitzgerald  Company in Atlanta, turned to the    digital media upstart Woven Digital. The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross’s primary audience  —   young men  —   on the entertainment sites that it owns, like Uproxx, Dime and BroBible. Woven has also specialized in   productions that, on the surface, do not feel like ads. To Mr. Wakeman, it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of Mr. Ross’s charisma and authenticity. “It just felt like such a unique opportunity,” he said. The video, which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long, was filmed over two days in Carol City in late September, mostly as Mr. Ross drove his truck around. Spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies. The first mention of Checkers comes about halfway through the video. Checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget, about $20 million, in standard television spots, Mr. Wakeman said. By contrast, the Rick Ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and Uproxx. But Mr. Wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video  —   and the compelling way Mr. Ross related his story  —   would resonate with viewers more than anything Checkers had tried in the past. “We don’t think of it as an advertisement,” Mr. Wakeman said, adding of Mr. Ross, “We wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand. ” Last year, Woven teamed up with MillerCoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards, or, in one case, doing calligraphy. The   series, sponsored by Coors Banquet beer and run across Uproxx, was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising. According to Brad Feinberg, senior director of media and digital marketing for MillerCoors, it was a success, receiving more than 33 million views. “This is content that people want to see they’re intrigued by it, they seek it out,” Mr. Feinberg said. “And putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places. ”   storytelling might sound incompatible with the   attention spans of millennials, but it can have its advantages. Young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return, said Leah Swartz, senior content specialist for FutureCast, a part of the Barkley agency of Kansas City, Mo. that focuses on research into millennials. Her team considers this a rewriting of the old ABCs of sales. Rather than the mantra “always be closing,” brands must now think about how they can “always be helping. ” “You have to think about helping your consumer, what you’re providing, what benefits you’re giving, how you’re making their lives more fulfilled,” Ms. Swartz said. For Checkers, turning a story about a hit rapper’s upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble, Mr. Wakeman said. In the video, there are only a couple of references to Checkers’ products, such as Mr. Ross’s unequivocal praise of the French fries. But Mr. Wakeman said the documentary format allowed Mr. Ross’s true voice to shine through. “Food and value are our two big brand pillars, and I think they come through in the spot, in a cool way,” Mr. Wakeman said. “It wasn’t a script. It was just Rick talking about what he loves” about the place. The video also captures moments of spontaneity. The producers originally intended just to film Mr. Ross outside the Checkers, but on the way there, he sent out a message on Instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in Carol City. About 200 people showed up, and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food. Benjamin Blank, the chief executive of Woven, said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement. But he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that   viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to. “There were plenty of things Rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint,” Mr. Blank said. “But his reason for getting involved with Checkers was a great story. ”",0,941,18.82,50,0.30924548352816156,0,0,0,0,93.93118397764681,15.793886949041044,84.62360204443095,69.8203279186276,0.8129649309245484,0.01700318809776833,0.039319872476089264,0.04144527098831031,0.02763018065887354,0.01700318809776833,0.20191285866099895,0,0.0021253985122210413,0.01487778958554729,0.08607863974495218,0.0010626992561105207,0.057385759829968117,0.012752391073326248,0.0010626992561105207,0.01700318809776833,0.007438894792773645,0.08607863974495218,0.0010626992561105207,0.07013815090329437,0.025504782146652496,0.04357066950053135,0,0,0.022316684378320937,0.011689691817215728,0.08289054197662062,0,0,0.005313496280552604,0.0021253985122210413,0,0.0021253985122210413,0.05526036131774708,0,0,0.4527098831030818,0.0021253985122210413,0.019128586609989374,0,0.003188097768331562,0.04357066950053135,0.0010626992561105207,0.008501594048884165,0.024442082890541977,0.011689691817215728,0.04144527098831031,0.04782146652497343,0.021253985122210415,0.01381509032943677,0.008501594048884165,0.0021253985122210413,0,0,0.01700318809776833,0.21253985122210414,0.006376195536663124,0,0.04250797024442083,0.0765143464399575,0.08395324123273114,0.04357066950053135,0.025504782146652496,0.04250797024442083,0.1594048884165781,0.0871413390010627,0.01700318809776833,0.0010626992561105207,0.031880977683315624,0.13496280552603612,0,0.01487778958554729,0.0010626992561105207,0,0.018065887353878853,0,0,0.023379383634431455,0.12646121147715197,0.08607863974495218,0,0.01381509032943677,0.007438894792773645,0.03825717321997875,0.1179596174282678,0.1275239107332625,0.003188097768331562,0.03294367693942614,0.006376195536663124,48.775,0,0,0,5,16,15,5,8.175,6.625,59.45,6,38,0,48.775,0,138.4,33,12.625,184.025,138.4,,0.6066710058618523,0,0,0,0.1365270594958143,0.3359736903587912,0.3217311600325895,0.1365270594958143,0.2054134853265679,0.17321268289640515,0.6527746514198279,0.1594778626660817,0.5457983989549906,0,0.05948348715197548,0,0.12862154689714458,0.03066843242489719,0.01173299876861597,0.17102297809065772,0.8490527075653796,0.8289770219093423,49
327,"VIDEOS Oil has been spilling into the Pacific Ocean since last month and its being totally ignored This is in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest, which is seen as “one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth” By Chris ""Kikila"" Perrin - Friday, November 18, 2016 8:53 AM EST Bella Bella, British Columbia — When is environmental damage too much? When is it acceptable? In what is being called “ a relatively tiny ” marine oil spill, for the Heiltsuk First Nations of the Central Coast of BC, the question is being asked in quite real terms, forcing government to answer the questions that it might have preferred to have evaded. Since running aground in mid-October , a small boat has been leaking oil into the Pacific Ocean, and along BC’s Central Coast. Despite the fact that this spill comes in the aftermath of the Royal Visit to the region — a visit that sought to place the health of the coastline and all the life that dwells there within the global lens — there appears to be very little international interest. Making matters worse, there appears to be little interest from Canadian lawmakers on how best to reduce the potential for disasters like this. Along the Central Coast of British Columbia, the Great Bear Rainforest is seen as “one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth.” Stretching approximately 400 kilometers along this sparsely populated area, the Great Bear Rainforest has long represented the very idea of conservation and intrinsic preservation to Canadians and environmentalists around the world. Along with the Kermode Bear , the area made National Geographic’s “ Places of a Lifetime ” list and has been called the planet’s last large expanse of coastal temperate rain forest by people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Natural beauty, conservation projects , and provincial parks are not, however, all the region is known for. Of all things, the Central Coast offers access to the Pacific Ocean. It also provides a more-or-less direct line for fossil fuel exportation from various LNG (liquefied natural gas) sites around the province, as well as tar sands oil from the neighbouring province of Alberta. North of Bella Bella, the town of Kitimat serves as the proposed terminal destination of Enbridge’s Northern Gateway Pipeline , a project that has seen a great deal of protest that, in many ways, echoes the issues coming to a head in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. One of the most attractive aspects of the region, insofar as fossil fuel extraction is concerned, is the access it offers to Asian markets , pitting the desires of big oil corporations against those of First Nations and environmentalists , alike. Even with the legislative death of Northern Gateway, the region continues to be the focal point for resource extraction. October’s oil spill — which is ongoing — provides a visceral reminder of what is at stake in such discussions, pushing many local residents to demand a full tanker ban along the Central Coast . Yet, while the Coastal Rainforest is inundated with thousands of litres of oil, the federal government seems content to remain reactive . Rather than agreeing to the suggested ban, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instead proposed a $1.5 billion (CDN) fund to help deal with oil spills after they occur. Reactive policies like this leave the fragile ecosystems found in the Central Coast region to suffer contamination before they are dealt with, and offer no change for the way issues of sovereignty are evaluated between First Nations and the colonial Canadian government. Since his election in 2015, PM Trudeau has taken several quick steps back from his promises to respect First Nations’ sovereignty and deal with environmental issues . Although this “ relatively tiny marine oil spill” can be seen as just that, a minor environmental issue that will be cleaned up with more federal money, there is a deeper implication that can be seen — one that pits ongoing environmental degradation and cultural assimilation and genocide against neoliberal economic policy .",1,665,36.94444444444444,18,0.3533834586466165,0,0,0,0,97.44680652912214,43.373333333333335,55.37353383458647,42.1203007518797,0.7714285714285715,0.009022556390977444,0.05413533834586466,0.03759398496240601,0.03458646616541353,0.0015037593984962407,0.13984962406015036,0.0015037593984962407,0.0015037593984962407,0.009022556390977444,0.0962406015037594,0,0.06315789473684211,0.006015037593984963,0.0030075187969924814,0.01804511278195489,0.009022556390977444,0.07368421052631578,0.0015037593984962407,0.05714285714285714,0.03609022556390978,0.045112781954887216,0.006015037593984963,0.0030075187969924814,0.015037593984962405,0.004511278195488722,0.058646616541353384,0,0,0.0030075187969924814,0,0,0.007518796992481203,0.02706766917293233,0.0015037593984962407,0.0015037593984962407,0.4345864661654135,0.0030075187969924814,0,0.006015037593984963,0,0.0406015037593985,0.004511278195488722,0,0.016541353383458645,0.010526315789473684,0.006015037593984963,0.0030075187969924814,0.006015037593984963,0.015037593984962405,0.0030075187969924814,0.012030075187969926,0.0030075187969924814,0.0015037593984962407,0.022556390977443608,0.20300751879699247,0.010526315789473684,0.0030075187969924814,0.031578947368421054,0.031578947368421054,0.039097744360902256,0.006015037593984963,0.021052631578947368,0.03458646616541353,0.16390977443609023,0.04661654135338346,0.022556390977443608,0.0030075187969924814,0.01804511278195489,0.17593984962406015,0.0015037593984962407,0.013533834586466165,0.004511278195488722,0.0015037593984962407,0.015037593984962405,0,0,0.0030075187969924814,0.031578947368421054,0.12481203007518797,0,0.019548872180451128,0.0030075187969924814,0.03759398496240601,0.10075187969924812,0.09924812030075188,0,0.019548872180451128,0,29.853125,0,42.25,1.725,6,5.11875,23.275,34,1.83,46.5,15,2,14,0,29.853125,0,46.683125,28.39375,98.425,165.39875,46.683125,,0.6114087043696699,0,0.6900926191990286,0.08333870420680024,0.24025307335204216,0.21246312566925124,0.5509049687268145,0.6418283383488073,0.08796526551761318,0.7102092011724356,0.4415184401122529,0.09535767393825997,0.42458124057404795,0,0.6528064202967505,0,0.05906275155419969,0.03592332351234108,0.12452575361486844,0.2092598830653515,-0.7940951284306225,0.7907401169346485,40
328,"Home Election 2016 Hillary Collapses On Her Way To The Stage, Sellout Bruce Springsteen Covers For Her Hillary Collapses On Her Way To The Stage, Sellout Bruce Springsteen Covers For Her Stryker Election 2016 , Leftist Corruption , Liberals Behaving Like Liberals 0 Hillary Clinton’s sad last push for votes was supposed to culminate in a gathering of “talent” the left was calling “The Avengers of campaigning.” Hillary, Slick Willy, Barry Soetoro and Moochelle along with Creepy Uncle Joe Biden were to all come together at a huge show featuring hasbeens Bon Jovi and working class sellout Bruce Springsteen. From one libtard to the next, promises of work-free lives filled with food stamp steak and lobster flew amid delusional dreams of free college education for everyone and a health care system that will cure what ails you for eleven bucks a month, no questions asked. The $15 minimum wage and 90 percent tax on the people who have done well in America were celebrated with great vigor, until it came time for the woman of the hour herself to take the stage. Bruce Springsteen, acting as master of ceremonies, shouted over the roar of the feminist-laden crowd, “Here she is, and I’m with her!” Unfortunately, she never appeared in the spotlight. Springsteen, after holding a finger to his earpiece, picked up his acoustic guitar and started slowly picking away a familiar tune. He turned to the audience and said: “You know, before the next President of the United States comes out here I want to make sure we’re all ready. Are you ready?” The crowd cheered. “If there’s one thing we’ve always known about this amazing woman, one thing that w2as never in question, it’s that she was born to run.” As the crowd went nuts for the popular song, interns and medical staff were reportedly attending to Clinton backstage after she collapsed from an unknown ailment. The press was quickly corralled and swept aside, but a couple of rogue stagehands tweeted about the incident before they were discovered and their posts deleted. This screenshot was grabbed within a minute of it being tweeted: Clinton is said to have looked pale and distant, unaware of her surroundings. As of the writing of this article, Springsteen was still playing his set.

330,"Dr. David Duke and Dr. Slattery Expose Hillary’s Treason and Why Trump & Duke will Win!  25 am Dr. David Duke and Dr. Slattery Expose Hillary’s Treason and Why Trump & Duke will Win! Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary’s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR’S HANDS! Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence.

332,"Hillary Clinton longs for the days when Americans knew how to execute a covert action abroad and not spill the details to reporters. Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton gave a   realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country, she made clear, she had no problem doing that. She went on to say  —   as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  —   that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition and moving forcefully to counter the Russians, who at that point were supporting President Bashar   but had not yet fully entered the conflict. “My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which paid Mrs. Clinton about $225, 000 a speech to give what felt like an insider’s view of the making of American foreign policy, months after she left office. But she quickly acknowledged that “we used to be much better at this than we are now. ” “Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves,” she added, and officials go out to “tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: ‘Look what we’re doing, and I want credit for it. ’” The three hacked speeches from 2013 that WikiLeaks published, most likely with Russian government assistance, help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the world’s knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the   way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on. By the time she left office that year, she had met and assessed two of the three world leaders who were determined most prominently to challenge the United States: President Xi Jinping of China, whom she clearly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she clearly detests (and who has returned the sentiment this election) and Kim   of North Korea, whose determination to build a nuclear weapon and missiles that could “reach Hawaii and the West Coast, theoretically” poses a risk “we cannot abide,” she said. At moments in the speeches, Mrs. Clinton was cleareyed about how difficult it would be to execute some of the actions she advocated, including a   zone over parts of Syria. “To have a   zone, you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,” she said. “So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk  —   you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. ” Her assessment of the risk came before she was formally running for president. But two years later, in a television interview in October 2015, she sounded willing to take that risk. “I personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air, to try to provide some way to take stock of what’s happening, to try to stem the flow of refugees,” she said. Her successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, tried last month to open those humanitarian corridors, but the effort collapsed in a dispute with Russia. A push to get it restarted during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday between Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, also failed. In the talks at Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton was often more analytic than prescriptive, describing her perceptions of individual leaders and the domestic politics and foreign threats they face. In that regard, her approach is quite different from that of Donald J. Trump. In two interviews on foreign policy with The New York Times, one in March and another in July, Mr. Trump moved directly to his plans of action: bombing the Islamic State and taking oil, for example, or withdrawing troops from Europe and Asia if allies do not pay their share. While Mr. Trump often talks in terms of striking deals, Mrs. Clinton talks in the more traditional terms of  . When she became secretary in 2009, she posed a question about China to an Australian leader: “How do you deal toughly with your banker?” In the Goldman transcript, she suggested that she had answered her own question when sparring with the Chinese over its claims in the South China Sea. “I made the point at one point in the argument that, you know, you can call it whatever you want to call it,” she said. “You don’t have a claim to all of it. I said, by that argument, you know, the United States should claim all of the Pacific. We liberated it, we defended it. We have as much claim to all of the Pacific. And we could call it the American Sea, and it could go from the West Coast of California all the way to the Philippines. ” “And, you know, my counterpart sat up very straight and goes, ‘Well, you can’t do that. ’” Mrs. Clinton segued into an evaluation of Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, who she noted had consolidated power in a way his predecessor never did, but had quickly traveled to places like Russia and Africa to assuage “doubts about Chinese practices. ” “So he’s someone who you at least have the impression is a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician,” she said. Mr. Xi has since become more aggressive in the South China Sea, and it is unclear how forcefully Mrs. Clinton, if she became president, would confront him over his claims. She acknowledged at one point that the administration had gotten distracted from its “pivot” to Asia. In North Korea, the situation has worsened much more drastically. She summarized the Chinese message to the North Koreans this way: “We don’t care if you occasionally shoot off a missile. That’s good. That upsets the Americans and causes them heartburn, but you can’t keep going down a path that is unpredictable. ” That, of course, is exactly the path they have gone down.",0,1058,24.045454545454547,44,0.2835538752362949,0,0,0,0,84.71044712781143,11.518019000533178,90.05837685431418,17.524259609325775,0.8119092627599244,0.01606805293005671,0.03213610586011342,0.035916824196597356,0.036862003780718335,0.01984877126654064,0.1833648393194707,0.006616257088846881,0.006616257088846881,0.014177693761814745,0.07939508506616257,0,0.057655954631379965,0.002835538752362949,0.000945179584120983,0.014177693761814745,0.012287334593572778,0.11058601134215501,0.004725897920604915,0.07088846880907372,0.024574669187145556,0.05860113421550094,0,0.000945179584120983,0.023629489603024575,0.01606805293005671,0.09640831758034027,0,0,0.000945179584120983,0.04158790170132325,0,0.002835538752362949,0.0444234404536862,0.000945179584120983,0.000945179584120983,0.5,0.001890359168241966,0.012287334593572778,0.000945179584120983,0.005671077504725898,0.054820415879017016,0.000945179584120983,0,0.026465028355387523,0.023629489603024575,0.003780718336483932,0.010396975425330813,0.003780718336483932,0.022684310018903593,0.012287334593572778,0.01984877126654064,0,0.000945179584120983,0.014177693761814745,0.21172022684310018,0.003780718336483932,0.000945179584120983,0.01984877126654064,0.05387523629489603,0.046313799621928164,0.08034026465028356,0.014177693761814745,0.045368620037807186,0.15406427221172023,0.13516068052930058,0.026465028355387523,0.000945179584120983,0.034026465028355386,0.13799621928166353,0.000945179584120983,0.014177693761814745,0.013232514177693762,0.000945179584120983,0.003780718336483932,0,0,0.03969754253308128,0.14272211720226843,0.07655954631379962,0,0.03213610586011342,0.007561436672967864,0.04064272211720227,0.12003780718336483,0.12381852551984877,0.011342155009451797,0.038752362948960305,0.01606805293005671,26.525,0,76.625,5,1,10,16,26.84375,3.675,58.375,19,0,8,0,26.525,7,48.2,34,155.71875,230.91875,48.2,,0.4720608163177556,0,0.720906468566599,0.14423856110165292,0.03261068708575956,0.2521127429279827,0.3503793320098116,0.4750387839495607,0.11022863565652835,0.6630524377899499,0.39042598269608936,0,0.21239994067041815,0,0.4187908756374854,0.19091884192380093,0.039189580612540464,0.027644102506771278,0.12660897315371442,0.187751223403985,-0.8367548240299221,0.812248776596015,59

The Public prosecutor claimed that the first defendant had the purpose of going to Yemen, and then to Syria, to join the army for fighting against the Takfiri terrorists. And the second one, had paid 2500 riyals to him as the expense of his trip. Despite six years of war in Syria, and definite denies of Shiites in Saudi Arabia for having connections with Iran and Syria, they are still accused for trying to make chaos in the region. None of these allegations has been proven, but Shiites are worried about the reflection of the chaotic situation of the region against themselves.",1,123,24.6,5,0.3333333333333333,0,0,0,0,99,21.471385302088322,65.79644685335742,1,0.8130081300813008,0.024390243902439025,0.032520325203252036,0.016260162601626018,0.04878048780487805,0.016260162601626018,0.10569105691056911,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0,0.0975609756097561,0,0.056910569105691054,0,0,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.08943089430894309,0,0.06504065040650407,0.008130081300813009,0.06504065040650407,0,0.008130081300813009,0.032520325203252036,0,0.10569105691056911,0,0,0,0,0,0.016260162601626018,0.04065040650406504,0,0,0.4959349593495935,0,0,0,0,0.016260162601626018,0,0,0.024390243902439025,0,0,0.024390243902439025,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.008130081300813009,0.04878048780487805,0,0,0.04878048780487805,0.21138211382113822,0,0,0,0.04065040650406504,0.04878048780487805,0.032520325203252036,0,0.04878048780487805,0.21951219512195122,0.04878048780487805,0.008130081300813009,0,0,0.12195121951219512,0.016260162601626018,0,0.016260162601626018,0,0,0,0,0.016260162601626018,0.08130081300813008,0.056910569105691054,0,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.04878048780487805,0.11382113821138211,0.12195121951219512,0,0.008130081300813009,0,2,0,14,0,1,5,0,6,2,34,3,0,4,0,2,0,7,5,46,56,7,,0.16666666666666666,0,0.5833333333333334,0,0.09090909090909091,0.3333333333333333,0,0.375,0.16666666666666666,0.7727272727272727,0.23076923076923078,0,0.2857142857142857,0,0.09090909090909091,0,0.042682926829268296,0.03048780487804878,0.2804878048780488,0.34146341463414637,-0.8465182565175027,0.6585365853658536,15
334,"Turkish Objections Won't Stop YPG's Involvement by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This US Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. Townsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are “going to take this in steps,” and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only “local forces” involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. Turkey’s military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it.

335,"in: Consciousness , Government Corruption , Society , Special Interests , US News No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We’ve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their “democracy” tactics using “special forces”, NGO’s, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson’s disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We’ve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I’m understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. That’s right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media “stories” and narratives unless we could “prove” that the account didn’t happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a “conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged “ political terrorism “, a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this “terrorism” or planned “event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many “events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today’s events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what’s coming this November 8th 2016. What’s coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they’ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I’ll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs) 2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let’s not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done. 3- Don’t rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don’t assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don’t discount that some “news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn’t ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it’s kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. And so today I’m thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no “political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. Finally, I’m reminded of the very last line of the film ‘ The American Dream ‘ when the villain asks “what do you think this is?” and the answer “this is AMERICA!!”. Likewise, let’s remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day.

336,"Protesters at last Saturday’s March for Science faced a continual downpour of rain when they gathered on the National Mall to protest President Donald Trump and his policies. This Saturday’s People’s Climate March may take place in record temperatures, as forecasters say the mercury could reach the   degree mark. [Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Virgin Airlines founder Richard Branson, and former vice president Al Gore are expected to attend, according to the Washington Post.  Tomorrow, we’re marching for a better world. March with us and #BeInconvenient https:  .  #ClimateMarch pic. twitter.   —   Al Gore (@algore) April 28, 2017,  The people backing the march range from the Communist Party USA, the Sierra Club, CODEPINK, and the Barack   Organizing for Action. But the man funding many of the organizations listed on the march’s website as members of the steering committee have received millions of dollars from George Soros, the   billionaire who has deep roots in the U. S. environmental movement and other liberal causes. “The ‘People’s Climate March,’ scheduled for the 100th day of Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to be a movement of the people. But is it really?” Newsbusters reported on Friday. “It turns out   of the steering committee organizations have one thing in common  —   donations from George Soros,” Newsbusters reported. “The liberal billionaire gave them more than $36 million combined. ” “Between 2000 and 2014, Soros gave $36, 018, 461 million to 18 of the 55 steering committee members of the People’s Climate March,” Newsbusters reported. “Donations to six of those groups were more $1 million each: Center for Community Change, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) People’s Action, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists. ” Newsbusters noted that only three of these six organizations  —   NRDC, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists  —   have climate as all or part of their mission, calling into question why so many   focused groups are taking part in the march. “The presence of many   related organizations leading the march indicated that this climate march (just like the March for Science and the Women’s March) is not about a single issue, but about attacking the new administration,” Newsbusters reported. The People’s Climate Change website states: Everything we have struggled to move forward in the United States is in peril. Our loved ones feel under siege, and those in power in Washington are advancing a dark and dangerous vision of America that we know is untrue. To change everything, we need everyone. On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, we will be in the streets of Washington D. C. to show the world and our leaders that we will resist attacks on our people, our communities and our planet. We will come together from across the United States to strengthen our movement. We will demonstrate our power and resistance at the gates of the White House. We will bring our solutions to the climate crisis, the problems that affect our communities and the threats to peace to our leaders in Congress to demand action. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports, “Environmentalists will once again rally in the nation’s capital this weekend, this time for the People’s Climate March,” noting that the march “will be more political and aimed at specific Trump administration policies. ” The Post said it’s “unclear” just how many people will show up, but “organizers are prepared to accommodate 50, 000 to 100, 000 people. ”",0,575,18.548387096774192,31,0.35304347826086957,0,0,0.0034782608695652175,0,95.47345599437477,28.351207729468598,91.78600543478261,18.11163337250294,0.8034782608695652,0.01217391304347826,0.03304347826086956,0.020869565217391306,0.02608695652173913,0.06608695652173913,0.21043478260869566,0.006956521739130435,0.0034782608695652175,0.02608695652173913,0.09043478260869565,0,0.050434782608695654,0.0034782608695652175,0,0.017391304347826087,0.008695652173913044,0.059130434782608696,0.0052173913043478265,0.06434782608695652,0.017391304347826087,0.04695652173913043,0,0,0.01565217391304348,0.006956521739130435,0.12695652173913044,0,0,0.0017391304347826088,0.0017391304347826088,0,0.020869565217391306,0.008695652173913044,0,0,0.4156521739130435,0,0.0034782608695652175,0.0034782608695652175,0,0.03826086956521739,0.0052173913043478265,0,0.008695652173913044,0.006956521739130435,0.010434782608695653,0.0034782608695652175,0.006956521739130435,0.03130434782608696,0.0017391304347826088,0.01391304347826087,0.0052173913043478265,0,0.050434782608695654,0.18608695652173912,0.019130434782608695,0.0052173913043478265,0.01391304347826087,0.05217391304347826,0.08,0.043478260869565216,0.008695652173913044,0.043478260869565216,0.1391304347826087,0.0817391304347826,0.02434782608695652,0.0017391304347826088,0.036521739130434785,0.16,0,0.006956521739130435,0.008695652173913044,0,0.008695652173913044,0,0.0017391304347826088,0.0017391304347826088,0.12,0.06608695652173913,0,0.006956521739130435,0.0052173913043478265,0.06086956521739131,0.08,0.0782608695652174,0.034782608695652174,0.059130434782608696,0.0017391304347826088,13,0,29,0,16,7,6,0,2,44.25,12,6,20,0,13,0,50,15,70.25,128.25,50,,0.3430097329217451,0,0.5380353996228666,0,0.3911999646583501,0.21943711798921586,0.19417601913675478,0,0.07434999738953722,0.6399150903474219,0.325205021747331,0.19417601913675478,0.4454362905434059,0,0.1672252033275417,0,0.07459903021260723,0.02237970906378217,0.10481163744871316,0.19134651249533757,-0.5349102665974272,0.8086534875046625,33
337,"Comments Republican nominee Donald Trump has been strategically placing certain people behind his him at rallies to create a false illusion about the diversity of his supporters. You may have noticed a man holding a “BLACKS FOR TRUMP” sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL “GODS2.com” underneath it. If you’ve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. The man holding the sign is “Michael the Black Man,” also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn’t your ordinary concerned citizen. He’s a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man’s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. Michael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. This may not mean much in the long run, but it’s worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer – but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.

338,"  Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted ‘monster’ who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her ‘The Warden’ in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill’s salacious double-life in the 1970s and ’80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyle’s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons’ marriage and the couple’s treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the ‘right to be believed’.  35  ",1,199,33.166666666666664,6,0.31155778894472363,0,0,0,0,96.5267104754542,14.2002436424547,95.59945956196074,8.019236809045225,0.7939698492462312,0.005025125628140704,0.035175879396984924,0.03015075376884422,0.04522613065326633,0.035175879396984924,0.18090452261306533,0.03015075376884422,0.005025125628140704,0.05025125628140704,0.09045226130653267,0,0.05025125628140704,0.03015075376884422,0,0.005025125628140704,0,0.035175879396984924,0,0.04522613065326633,0.03015075376884422,0.05025125628140704,0.035175879396984924,0,0.01507537688442211,0.005025125628140704,0.08040201005025126,0,0.010050251256281407,0,0.05025125628140704,0,0,0.05025125628140704,0.010050251256281407,0.010050251256281407,0.457286432160804,0.010050251256281407,0.02512562814070352,0,0,0.03015075376884422,0.005025125628140704,0,0.01507537688442211,0.020100502512562814,0.005025125628140704,0.01507537688442211,0.020100502512562814,0.010050251256281407,0,0.03015075376884422,0,0.005025125628140704,0.035175879396984924,0.19597989949748743,0,0,0.02512562814070352,0.03015075376884422,0.03015075376884422,0.05527638190954774,0.01507537688442211,0.04020100502512563,0.1708542713567839,0.08542713567839195,0.01507537688442211,0,0.020100502512562814,0.1658291457286432,0,0,0.005025125628140704,0,0,0,0.020100502512562814,0.04522613065326633,0.18592964824120603,0.08542713567839195,0,0.010050251256281407,0.010050251256281407,0.08040201005025126,0.10552763819095477,0.09547738693467336,0,0.010050251256281407,0,3,0,32,0,0,0,0,9,0,7,0,0,9,0,3,0,12,0,40,52,12,,0.2149851662190087,0,0.744975180527316,0,0,0,0,0.45102718848538204,0,0.3898754655031444,0,0,0.45102718848538204,0,0,0,0.0502092050209205,0,0.16736401673640167,0.2175732217573222,-0.7833051555419678,0.7824267782426778,12

Fox News Just Exposed Hillary’s ILLEGAL VOTING Scheme To The Entire Country! fisher 2 mins ago News Comments Off on Fox News Just Exposed Hillary’s ILLEGAL VOTING Scheme To The Entire Country! Fox News Just Exposed Hillary ’s ILLEGAL VOTING Scheme To The Entire Country! Hillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. Once again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti- Trump speech. Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented “Dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump ’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. Clinton’s national voter registration program, called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,” was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee.

340,"Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita domano l’egemonia del dollaro di Ariel Noyola Rodríguez Gli Stati Uniti aumentano gli ostacoli tentando di mantenere l’egemonia del dollaro come valuta di riserva mondiale. Negli ultimi mesi, i Paesi emergenti hanno venduto un molti buoni del tesoro degli USA, principalmente Russia e Cina, ma anche Arabia Saudita. Inoltre, per proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro, le banche centrali di diversi Paesi acquistano enormi quantità di oro per diversificare le riserve valutarie. In breve, l’offensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro è esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli Stati Uniti e, in parallelo, l’acquisto colossale di metalli preziosi. Rete Voltaire | Città del Messico (Messico) | 5 novembre 2016 français Español La supremazia di Washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito un colpo tremendo ad agosto: Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita vendevamo titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti per 37,9 miliardi di dollari, secondo l’ultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni [ 1 ]. Dal punto di vista generale, gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli Stati Uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio 2012. Chiaramente, il ruolo del dollaro a valuta di riserva mondiale è ancora messo in discussione. Nel 2010, l’ammiraglio Michael Mullen, presidente del Joint Chiefs of Staff statunitense, avvertì che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale [ 2 ]. A mio avviso, non è tanto l’alto debito pubblico (oltre i 19 000 miliardi [ 3 ]) ad ostacolare l’economia degli Stati Uniti, ma per Washington è di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno, per coprire i deficit gemelli (commercio e bilancio); cioè per il dipartimento del Tesoro è questione di vita o di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e così finanziare le spese degli USA. Si ricordi che dal fallimento di Lehman Brothers nel settembre 2008, Bank of China ha subito forti pressioni da Ben Bernanke, allora presidente della Federal Reserve (FED), a non vendere i titoli del debito degli Stati Uniti. In un primo momento, i cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro. Tuttavia, da allora, per due volte, la PBoC evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli Stati Uniti e, allo stesso tempo, avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie. Pechino acquista oro in maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni, e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della Russia. Nel secondo trimestre del 2016, le riserve auree della Banca di Cina hanno raggiunto le 1 823 tonnellate contro le 1 762 tonnellate registrate nell’ultimo trimestre del 2015. La Federazione Russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa 290 tonnellate tra dicembre 2014 e giugno 2016, chiudendo il secondo trimestre di quest’anno con un totale di 1 500 tonnellate. Di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro è fondamentale acquistare asset più sicuri come l’oro che, in tempi di grave instabilità finanziaria, agisce da rifugio sicuro. Quindi la strategia di Mosca e Pechino nel vendere titoli del Tesoro degli USA e comprare oro, viene seguita da molti Paesi. Come stimato dal Fondo monetario internazionale (FMI), le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno già raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi 15 anni, registrando ai primi di ottobre un volume di circa 33 000 tonnellate [ 4 ]. La geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale. Dopo l’imposizione delle sanzioni economiche al Cremlino, a partire dal 2014, il rapporto con la Cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per i russi. Da allora, le due potenze hanno approfondito i legami in tutti i settori, dall’economia e finanza alla cooperazione militare. Inoltre, assicurando la fornitura di gas alla Cina per i prossimi tre decenni, il Presidente Vladimir Putin ha costruito con l’omologo Xi Jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense. Attualmente, gli idrocarburi che Mosca vende a Pechino sono pagati in yuan, non dollari. Così, la “moneta del popolo” (‘renminbi’ in cinese) emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra Russia e Cina, Paesi che, a mio parere, guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare. La grande novità è che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione dell’economia globale si è unita l’Arabia Saudita, Paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di Washington. Sorprendentemente, negli ultimi 12 mesi Riad s’è sbarazzata di più di 19 miliardi di dollari investiti in titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti, divenendo insieme alla Cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli Stati Uniti [ 5 ]. A peggiorare le cose, il regno saudita si accanisce sempre più con la Casa Bianca. A fine settembre, il Congresso degli Stati Uniti approvava l’eliminazione del veto del presidente Barack Obama ad una legge che impediva negli USA di denunciare l’Arabia Saudita in tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell’11 settembre 2001 [ 6 ]. Insieme, l’Organizzazione dei Paesi Esportatori del Petrolio (OPEC) ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la Russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere l’aumento dei prezzi [ 7 ]. E’ anche sorprendente che giusto oggi Pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il Trading System Foreign Exchange della Cina (CFETS, nell’acronimo inglese) per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro. Di conseguenza, è molto probabile che, più prima che poi, la compagnia petrolifera Saudi Aramco accetti pagamenti in yuan invece che dollari [ 8 ]. Se si accadesse, la Casa dei Saud punterebbe tutto sul petroyuan [ 9 ]. Il mondo cambia davanti ai nostri occhi…",1,922,27.939393939393938,33,0.41323210412147504,0,0,0,0,94.38215749061736,1,47.83080260303688,45.70382112464542,0.18655097613882862,0.0010845986984815619,0.0032537960954446853,0.0010845986984815619,0.01735357917570499,0.0010845986984815619,0.16377440347071584,0.0021691973969631237,0,0.027114967462039046,0.008676789587852495,0,0,0.0021691973969631237,0,0,0,0.0032537960954446853,0.0010845986984815619,0.0650759219088937,0,0,0,0.0010845986984815619,0,0,0.014099783080260303,0,0.0032537960954446853,0,0.0021691973969631237,0,0,0.0010845986984815619,0,0,0.03470715835140998,0.0010845986984815619,0,0,0.009761388286334056,0,0.014099783080260303,0.0010845986984815619,0.0021691973969631237,0,0,0.0010845986984815619,0.033622559652928416,0.010845986984815618,0,0.0032537960954446853,0.014099783080260303,0,0.039045553145336226,0.04772234273318872,0.0227765726681128,0.008676789587852495,0,0.03470715835140998,0.05314533622559653,0.009761388286334056,0.014099783080260303,0.01193058568329718,0.015184381778741865,0.009761388286334056,0,0,0.0032537960954446853,0.039045553145336226,0.005422993492407809,0,0,0.0010845986984815619,0,0.0010845986984815619,0,0,0.004338394793926247,0.03036876355748373,0,0.0010845986984815619,0,0.005422993492407809,0.004338394793926247,0.005422993492407809,0,0.021691973969631236,0,0,6,11,0,0,0,0,0,1.83,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.15,0,15,31.14999999999999,16.15,,0,0.18933139574356017,0.2998054113740869,0,0,0,0,0,0.0664959690738573,0,0.03746656321294425,0,0,0,0.13472338607037426,0,0.017251508839395396,0,0.01602307322544464,0.033274582064840026,0.05953643752089106,0.96672541793516,17
341,"NEW DELHI  —   First, Yashpal Singh Rathore’s marriage was delayed by his future   who, like most Indians, ran short of cash after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the country’s largest currency notes in November. Then the    lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that, the prospective   refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job. “So I lost my job and I lost my marriage,” he said in an interview at a protest, where he shouted slogans with more than 100    workers let go by Hero. Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians  —   the precise number is not known  —   who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8, when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country’s currency in a bid to eliminate “black money,” currency on which taxes had not been paid. For the sake of secrecy, the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up. That, in turn, has proved economically damaging. Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine, but the available data is not reassuring. Demand for vegetables is declining because people don’t have the money to pay for them, for example, and some service industries are reporting steep job losses. The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year, to 6. 6 percent. While the full impact is still difficult to discern, there is little doubt who is suffering the most. “This has actually hurt the poor enormously,” said Nasser Munjee, chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors. The pain is hidden, for the most part. Accustomed to hardship, many who lost employment were at first convinced by Mr. Modi’s speeches that their setbacks were transitory and, in the long run, would be worth the suffering. But as the crisis drags on, with no end in sight, some are growing frustrated, as they told us in a series of interviews at protests and at day labor gathering points. Many of them, even children, are forced to go without fruit, vegetables and milk  —   now unaffordable luxuries. Most had not paid apartment rents and their children’s school fees in the months since the cash ban. Many had sent their families back to their villages, and were ready to give up and follow if things did not turn around soon. Sending cash to the elderly parents they had long supported is now out of the question. As is common in India, the workers said that although they had worked on Hero MotoCorp’s shop floor, wearing company uniforms, they had been formally employed by other contractors, meaning they could be let go more easily without benefits. Sunil Kumar, 28, who had been earning 15, 000 rupees a month, about $220, at Hero, said he had been supporting his wife and two children when he lost his job without notice Nov. 29. They immediately cut milk, green vegetables and fruit from their diets, including for their    and    children. Paying rent is out of the question. “This is like a massacre for us,” he said. “My livelihood is gone after the cash ban. What do I do now?” The decline in vegetable demand is so steep that the prices of eggplants, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes dropped between 42 percent and 78 percent, the NCDEX Institute of Commodity Markets and Research said. In the first month alone after the currency ban, micro and   service industries cut staff by 35 percent, the All India Manufacturers’ Organization said, based on a survey. It released a study this month saying that job losses in a variety of industries, including automobile parts, infrastructure and construction, would swell to as much as 35 percent by March. The anecdotal evidence is painful. Mr. Rathore, whose wedding was postponed, is among 582 workers who reported losing their jobs at Hero MotoCorp in November and December, as the company suffered a 34 percent drop in   sales in December from a year earlier. Hero did not respond to requests for comment. Most economists believe the economy will rebound, but nobody knows how long it will take. In Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, hundreds of unshaven men in rumpled clothing stood recently at a   intersection called Khoda Labor Chowk that is a gathering place for people seeking work. Before the currency ban, they told us, they would be hired most days, earning 400 to 600 rupees, about $6 to $9, for a day of carpentry, floor tiling or masonry. But since the ban, most interviewed said, they had worked for only a week each month, at best, and even on the few days when they were hired their wages had fallen by half. Rafiq Ali, 46, said that, having worked only 12 days in the last two months, he had sent his wife and two children back to his native village about 200 miles away, where it is cheaper to live. “I am surviving on roti and potato with salt,” Mr. Ali said, referring to the flat Indian bread that is a staple in the Indian diet. “I’ve stopped taking milk, even in tea, and eating vegetables. ” But what hurt him most, he said, was a recent call from his wife, back in the village, who wanted money to take their sick daughter to a doctor. Mr. Ali said he had nothing to send. “A sense of desperation and helplessness is emerging,” he said. “This currency ban is not helpful for poor people. ” Hoti Lal, a    father of three, said he could get work for only six days during the last two months, forcing his family to survive on money his    son made cleaning offices. Mr. Lal had hoped his son could give up that job to go to college, but that dream is fading fast. His son’s salary of 7, 000 rupees a month, a little over $100, is about half of what he used to earn regularly, Mr. Lal said. So, Mr. Lal said, his family has cut back entirely on green vegetables and milk. Almost every man we interviewed said he was a migrant who had been sending a portion of his salary home to support his parents in his native village  —   and had been unable to do so since the currency ban wiped out work. Vikas Sahu, 30, who had been working at Hero for four years, has been unable to send money back to his parents, wife and children, who live in his village about 100 miles west of New Delhi. His first grader’s school fees are overdue by months, and his father took out a loan of 70, 000 rupees, about $1, 000, for agricultural expenses, including paying for repairs on the family’s tractor. “How long I can survive like this?” he asked. With little else to do, Rakesh Yadav, 28, shows up most days to protest, hoping for some relief from the government or some upbeat economic news that might induce Hero to begin rehiring. He had worked there for eight years as a machine operator on the shop floor. To cut costs, his wife and daughter went home to his village. He gave up the one room they had shared at a monthly rental of 3, 300 rupees, or about $50, and moved in with four other men who share a room. “I do not know where to go or what to do,” he said. Mr. Rathore said he thought about giving up and returning to his village in Bilaspur district, about 750 miles south of Delhi, but he just cannot bear to do so, at least not yet. “What can I do in my village?” he asked.",0,1326,20.71875,64,0.26018099547511314,0,0,0,0,85.67015827309945,21.615650785200952,83.28273001508296,13.511115482982488,0.8815987933634992,0.026395173453996983,0.04072398190045249,0.0392156862745098,0.04675716440422323,0.01885369532428356,0.1779788838612368,0.0030165912518853697,0.0030165912518853697,0.00904977375565611,0.06334841628959276,0,0.07767722473604827,0.023378582202111614,0.0007541478129713424,0.00980392156862745,0.005279034690799397,0.0693815987933635,0,0.08672699849170437,0.027149321266968326,0.053544494720965306,0,0.0007541478129713424,0.023378582202111614,0.007541478129713424,0.09502262443438914,0,0.017345399698340876,0.003770739064856712,0.005279034690799397,0,0.006033182503770739,0.07390648567119155,0,0,0.4698340874811463,0.007541478129713424,0.016591251885369532,0.00904977375565611,0.00904977375565611,0.033936651583710405,0,0.016591251885369532,0.013574660633484163,0.021870286576168928,0.005279034690799397,0.04675716440422323,0.042232277526395176,0.021870286576168928,0.01282051282051282,0.02790346907993967,0,0,0.042232277526395176,0.27677224736048267,0.008295625942684766,0,0.02790346907993967,0.053544494720965306,0.10180995475113122,0.06259426847662142,0.01885369532428356,0.043740573152337855,0.15610859728506787,0.09653092006033183,0.02790346907993967,0.0022624434389140274,0.01809954751131222,0.15761689291101055,0.0007541478129713424,0.008295625942684766,0.006787330316742082,0.012066365007541479,0.004524886877828055,0,0,0.033182503770739065,0.138763197586727,0.07993966817496229,0,0.01885369532428356,0.017345399698340876,0.06108597285067873,0.14404223227752638,0.15233785822021115,0.0030165912518853697,0.06033182503770739,0,50,0,115.05,4,7.625,1,23.025,69.725,18.375,82.3,3.75,8.25,29,46.4,50,0,99,26.025,329.55,443.55,99,,0.582906244262433,0,0.7627940166464554,0.10056040392403998,0.1756827934924789,0.027190842564500887,0.39156773040041876,0.6608873962562872,0.33932209820158915,0.6970022859212379,0.09487164939026403,0.1873846407343384,0.44768916072870707,0.5646342713344896,0.7878016331779428,0,0.05979885838543082,0.015719851408897347,0.19905771495877503,0.2679170064329075,-0.9011201987074693,0.7320829935670925,114
342,"While support for the Trump administration’s positions on many issues has declined in recent months, one of the president’s most controversial policies has held its ground or perhaps even grown in popularity. [Some of the administration’s most popular positions have seen their popularity decline, according to CNBC’s quarterly “All American Survey. ” The share of Americans who say they somewhat or strongly support the administration’s plans to rebuild American infrastructure, for example, has declined to 62 percent from 75 percent three months earlier. Support for individual tax cuts has fallen to 59 percent from 64 percent, while support for cuts to business taxes fell to 50 percent from 54 percent.  Renegotiating trade deals has lost support, falling to 50 percent from 58 percent. Support for regulatory relief has declined to 44 percent from 47 percent. Public support for repealing Obamacare very nearly held steady, losing just one percentage point of support from 45 percent to 44 percent. But the public remains strongly divided on healthcare, with opposition to the administration’s repeal and replace plans edging up to 38 percent from 37 percent in April. So which issue has gained popularity? Banning immigration from specific Middle Eastern and African countries. Public support for the ban rose by a percentage point, with 44 percent of Americans now saying the strongly or somewhat support the ban. That slight rise was due to a one percentage point gain in the “strongly support” category. Opposition to the ban has slightly declined, falling to 49 percent from 50 percent. The share of respondents who said they “strongly oppose” the plan, however, saw a steeper decline, to 32 percent from 36 percent.

343,"Email Speaking at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Canton, Ohio, last November, former President Bill Clinton (right) expressed disappointment concerning a then-recent Democratic presidential candidates’ debate, during which, he said, there was not a single mention of the fact that “84 percent of the American people, after inflation, had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash.” The financial crash of which Clinton spoke began in late 2007 and extended into 2008 — the year Barack Obama was elected president. Though his administration was not responsible for the crash, when Clinton spoke last year, Obama had been president for more than six years. Therefore, Clinton’s observations indicated that the vast majority of Americans had made no financial progress during Obama’s entire first term and half of his second term. Britain’s Daily Mail reported that the former president’s speech was published by WikiLeaks as part of the website’s release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s e-mails. In addition to the lack of income growth among most Americans, Clinton revealed a remarkable statistic: The life expectancy of middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans is declining. Said the former president: And in the middle of all this we learned, breathtakingly, that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans’ life expectancy is going down and is now lower than Hispanics, even though they make less money. And the gap between African Americans and whites is closing, but unfortunately not because the death rate among African Americans is dropping but because the death rate among white Americans is rising. Why? Because they don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning. Because their lives are sort of stuck in neutral. Clinton’s explanation that the reason that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans’ life expectancy is going down is because “they don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning” is probably an oversimplification that requires greater analysis. The obvious reason why someone may not have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning is because they are unemployed and therefore have no job to go to. Figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2015 — the year Clinton gave his speech — indicated that those with only a high-school diploma had a 5.4 percent unemployment rate, compared with a 2.8 percent rate for those with bachelor’s degrees. (These figures did not account for race, and they didn't count literally millions of unemployed Americans: After a few months of looking for work, the government drops them from the unemployment rolls, deeming them to not want to work. In 2009, 80 million Americans were deemed not in the labor force; now it's 95 million. Also, if an American is able to find a low-paying part-time job out of his field, he is considered employed by the government.) An article published by Fortune on November 3, 2015 (about two weeks before Clinton’s speech) may have provided him with a basis for his statement. The article’s headline? “Is the Economy Killing Middle-Aged White People?” The article cited a survey released by a pair of researchers at Princeton University the previous day showing “a striking increase in the death rates of white, middle-aged Americans who have less than a college education.” Though the researchers Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel laureate in Economics, and his wife, Anne Case, both professors at Princeton, didn’t form any steadfast conclusions about the reasons for the increase in death rates, they did speculate that economic factors are likely at least partly responsible. Fortune reported: Between 1999 and 2013, white men and women ages 45-54 saw their mortality rate increase by a half-percent per year, reversing decades of improvements up until that time. The main causes were suicide and the use of alcohol and drugs (both legal and illegal), according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The article noted that while it is impossible to know for sure how attributable the high death rates are to economic forces without more study, the Princeton researchers have speculated that the economic crisis of 2008 might have been a major factor. The research paper considered an explanation for why the higher death rate has affected white middle-aged people more than those in other ethnic and racial groups subject to the same economic downturn. Their explanation was that “working-class whites have decades of relative success and security behind them…. For the first time, perhaps, that group has seen a reversal of its fortunes.” We might add another explanation for the increased mortality rates: Workers accustomed to having their medical care paid for by their employers may find that, upon becoming unemployed, they can no longer afford medical insurance and, as a result, neglect the healthcare necessary to maintain their health. While Clinton did not refer to the Princeton professors' paper in his speech, it is possible that its release just weeks before did provide him with some talking points. Clinton’s comments were made in the context of a stump speech on behalf of his wife’s candidacy, and he did not offer any substantive solutions for the crisis among white middle-aged Americans. He instead offered this vague proposal: We have unlimited potential in America to grow our economy if we do a few things right, and not a lot. Five or six or seven things, really we’ll see jobs start forming again; we’ll see business formation going up again; we’ll see wages rising again. And I believe she’s outlined reasonable responses to all the things that will do that. And I ought to have some credibility on that, because the only time in 50 years when all sections of the American economy have grown together were in the eight years I had the privilege to serve. In that regard, Clinton (on behalf of his wife) shared in rival candidate Donald Trump’s tendency to make many promises to grow the economy and create jobs offering higher wages, while offering few concrete details about how these lofty goals might be realized. Considering that the best thing that government can do to stimulate the economy is simply to get out of the way and allow the free market to flourish, however, any plan offered by a former Cabinet member of the administration that gave us ObamaCare might well be viewed with skepticism. We might also want to remember that the former president is the one who signed NAFTA, the trade deal that negatively impacted American jobs — leaving many Americans without ""anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning.”",1,1137,30.72972972972973,37,0.33421284080914687,0,0,0,0,88.62399122425508,29.988515856407773,63.08510926189027,36.608754482105404,0.841688654353562,0.014072119613016711,0.05452946350043975,0.03342128408091469,0.01759014951627089,0.0158311345646438,0.1503957783641161,0.0008795074758135445,0,0.022867194371152155,0.08443271767810026,0,0.07475813544415127,0.009674582233948988,0.0008795074758135445,0.032541776605101144,0.0079155672823219,0.12049252418645559,0.005277044854881266,0.047493403693931395,0.03430079155672823,0.05013192612137203,0.018469656992084433,0.008795074758135445,0.028144239226033423,0.008795074758135445,0.07036059806508356,0,0.002638522427440633,0,0.0043975373790677225,0,0.018469656992084433,0.044854881266490766,0,0,0.4635004397537379,0.0079155672823219,0.009674582233948988,0,0.002638522427440633,0.04573438874230431,0.0008795074758135445,0.001759014951627089,0.024626209322779244,0.013192612137203167,0.001759014951627089,0.014951627088830254,0.026385224274406333,0.01759014951627089,0.018469656992084433,0.005277044854881266,0,0.0008795074758135445,0.030782761653474055,0.24538258575197888,0.0043975373790677225,0.0043975373790677225,0.029023746701846966,0.0316622691292876,0.09586631486367635,0.04309586631486367,0.011433597185576077,0.03342128408091469,0.14072119613016712,0.08883025505716799,0.032541776605101144,0.002638522427440633,0.010554089709762533,0.14599824098504838,0,0.0079155672823219,0.003518029903254178,0.003518029903254178,0.018469656992084433,0.002638522427440633,0,0.014072119613016711,0.07387862796833773,0.06772207563764292,0,0.029023746701846966,0.01759014951627089,0.06684256816182937,0.13368513632365875,0.1248900615655233,0.008795074758135445,0.07651715039577836,0,20,0,44,3.55,3,1,11.25,20,8,76.275,8,8.375,12,0,20,0,57.375,12.25,131.225,199.85,57.375,,0.42370241279240506,0,0.6179520027017399,0.11543611383325024,0.09932807531109802,0.035457295016875355,0.2925653981808211,0.42370241279240506,0.22725373985172645,0.7371136229616511,0.22725373985172645,0.23539867008850723,0.3060994835732393,0,0.7201428194175572,0,0.045182501870299645,0.009646808678190339,0.10333897704453282,0.15738079300704808,-0.7933576333645739,0.8426192069929519,67
344,"Comments Former US Attorney General Eric Holder just wrote an op-ed warning the American people to disregard the FBI Director James Comey’s unprecedented decision to release information about an ongoing investigation during the heat of an election. Comey released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office. Democratic congressional staffers now claim that their first warning of the Comey memo was when a House Republican tweeted it out with the usual anti-Hillary spin. That alone demonstrates exactly what Holder wrote about preventing “investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion,” which happened nearly instantly on Friday afternoon. Former Attorney General Holder also pointed out that Comey’s “newly discovered” emails have no known significance and that the FBI Director violated long standing policies in the Department of Justice – which are non-partisan – aimed at upholding the integrity of America’s form of electoral democracy, free from government intervention: I understand the gravity of the work our Justice Department performs every day to defend the security of our nation, protect the American people, uphold the rule of law and be fair. That is why I am deeply concerned about FBI Director James B. Comey’s decision to write a vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest. That decision was incorrect. The department also has a policy of not taking unnecessary action close in time to Election Day that might influence an election’s outcome. These rules have been followed during Republican and Democratic administrations. They aren’t designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest. Instead, they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and judiciously; to maintain the public trust in the department’s ability to do its job free of political influence; and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong. Director Comey broke with these fundamental principles. I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed — again without improper motive — misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions. Already, we have learned that the importance of the discovery itself may have been overblown. According to the director himself, there is no indication yet that the “newly discovered” emails bear any significance at all. And yet, because of his decision to comment on this development before sufficient facts were known, the public has faced a torrent of conspiracy theories and misrepresentations. High ranking former Justice Department officials like Eric Holder do not make a career out of slamming their former colleagues, so it’s a very rare break in the ranks to see a former Attorney General publicly slam his former subordinate. The Hatch Act prevents federal officials from interfering in partisan elections and strictly demands that public officials refrain from doing anything that could impact an election. Holder wrote : I served with Jim Comey and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications. It is incumbent upon him — or the leadership of the department — to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake — not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people. FBI Director James Comey knew better than to release a vague memo about an ongoing investigation, which, even under normal circumstances, should never be done. That is why former Attorney General Holder felt compelled to rebuke him in this scathing op-ed. Hopefully, the current members of the Justice Department tasked with reviewing the bipartisan complaints read the memo and expedite their decision concerning the future of the FBI Director. It should not take long for any rational investigator to determine that James Comey’s “cry wolf” memo was little more than a partisan prop handed to a failing campaign — and to remove the FBI Director from his office.",1,726,22.6875,32,0.38705234159779617,0,0,0,0,90.79951840660624,10.995041322314052,62.94735231098867,19.594123048668504,0.7988980716253443,0.02066115702479339,0.05647382920110193,0.03856749311294766,0.05234159779614325,0.012396694214876033,0.11294765840220386,0.0013774104683195593,0.006887052341597796,0.012396694214876033,0.08402203856749312,0,0.06060606060606061,0,0,0.023415977961432508,0.015151515151515152,0.12121212121212122,0.0027548209366391185,0.023415977961432508,0.026170798898071626,0.04269972451790634,0.005509641873278237,0,0.024793388429752067,0.008264462809917356,0.1184573002754821,0,0,0.0013774104683195593,0,0,0.008264462809917356,0.04132231404958678,0.0013774104683195593,0.0013774104683195593,0.453168044077135,0,0,0.0013774104683195593,0.009641873278236915,0.046831955922865015,0.005509641873278237,0,0.030303030303030304,0.012396694214876033,0,0.023415977961432508,0.011019283746556474,0.008264462809917356,0.015151515151515152,0.027548209366391185,0.004132231404958678,0.0013774104683195593,0.0013774104683195593,0.18319559228650137,0.011019283746556474,0,0.0027548209366391185,0.0440771349862259,0.08539944903581267,0.0440771349862259,0.023415977961432508,0.06887052341597796,0.14049586776859505,0.09090909090909091,0.01652892561983471,0,0.011019283746556474,0.10055096418732783,0,0.006887052341597796,0.02066115702479339,0.005509641873278237,0.0013774104683195593,0.0027548209366391185,0,0.02066115702479339,0.07575757575757576,0.04132231404958678,0,0.030303030303030304,0.006887052341597796,0.048209366391184574,0.11294765840220386,0.09917355371900827,0.006887052341597796,0.081267217630854,0,15,0,32.4,3,2,15,5,17,0,69.35,21,0,31,0,15,0,65,22,136.25,217.25,65,,0.3722248655908566,0,0.5615424406588151,0.10601373033920936,0.07326484679668878,0.3722248655908566,0.16502618927924417,0.4019081532276341,0,0.7327131884903924,0.45358114024265184,0,0.5506390662873579,0,0.5019860805512796,0,0.0740108169655565,0.025049814972957586,0.1551380586393396,0.24736692285795617,-0.7993175224387612,0.7526330771420439,65
345,"  => “In victory, magnanimity!” said Winston Churchill. Donald Trump should be magnanimous and gracious toward those whom he defeated this week, but his first duty is to keep faith with those who put their faith in him. The protests, riots and violence that have attended his triumph in city after city should only serve to steel his resolve. As for promptings that he “reach out” and “reassure” those upset by his victory, and trim or temper his agenda to pacify them, Trump should reject the poisoned chalice. This is the same old con. Trump should take as models the Democrats FDR and LBJ. Franklin Roosevelt, who had savaged Herbert Hoover as a big spender, launched his own New Deal in his first 100 days. History now hails his initiative and resolve. Lyndon Johnson exploited his landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964 to erect his Great Society in 1965: the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid. He compromised on nothing, and got it all. Even those who turned on him for Vietnam still celebrate his domestic achievements. President Nixon’s great regret was that he did not bomb Hanoi and mine Haiphong in 1969 — instead of waiting until 1972 — and bring the Vietnam War to an earlier end and with fewer U.S. casualties. Nixon’s decision not to inflame the social and political crisis of the ’60s by rolling back the Great Society bought him nothing. He was rewarded with media-backed mass demonstrations in 1969 to break his presidency and bring about an American defeat in Vietnam. “Action this day!” was the scribbled command of Prime Minister Churchill on his notepads in World War II. This should be the motto of the first months of a Trump presidency. For the historic opportunity he and the Republican Party have been given by his stunning and unanticipated victory of Nov. 8 will not last long. His adversaries and enemies in politics and press are only temporarily dazed and reeling. This great opening should be exploited now. Few anticipated Tuesday morning what we would have today: a decapitated Democratic Party, with the Obamas and Clintons gone or going, Joe Biden with them, no national leader rising, and only the power of obstruction, of which the nation has had enough. The GOP, however, on Jan. 20, will control both Houses of Congress and the White House, with the real possibility of remaking the Supreme Court in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have indicated they are willing to work with President Trump. There is nothing to prevent the new GOP from writing history. In his first months, Trump could put a seal on American politics as indelible as that left by Ronald Reagan. A partial agenda: First, he should ignore any importunings by President Obama to permit passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame-duck session — and let the trade deal sink by year’s end. On Jan. 20, he should have vetted and ready to nominate to the high court a brilliant constitutionalist and strict constructionist. He should act to end interference with the Dakota Access pipeline and call on Congress to re-enact legislation, vetoed by Obama, to finish the Keystone XL pipeline. Then he should repeal all Obama regulations that unnecessarily restrict the production of the oil, gas and clean coal necessary to make America energy independent again. Folks in Pennsylvania, southeast Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia should be shown, by executive action, that Trump is a man of his word. And when the mines open again, he should be there. He should order new actions to seal the Southern border, start the wall and begin visible deportations of felons who are in the country illegally. With a new education secretary, he should announce White House intent to work for repeal of Common Core and announce the introduction of legislation to put federal resources behind the charter schools that have proven to be a godsend to inner-city black children. He should propose an immediate tax cut for U.S. corporations, with $2 to $3 trillion in unrepatriated profits abroad, who will bring the money home and invest it in America, to the benefit of our economy and our Treasury. He should take the president’s phone and pen and begin the rewriting or repeal of every Obama executive order that does not comport with the national interest or political philosophy of the GOP. Trump should announce a date soon for repeal and replacement of Obamacare and introduction of his new tax-and-trade legislation to bring back manufacturing and create American jobs. Donald Trump said in his campaign that that this is America’s last chance. If we lose this one, he said, we lose the country. The president-elect should ignore his more cautious counselors, and act with the urgency of his declared beliefs.

346,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Hundreds of Syrian men who escaped   areas of eastern Aleppo to reach   parts of the city are missing, United Nations officials said on Friday, adding that they had received reports of government reprisals, including numerous arrests and several cases of summary killings of suspected supporters of the opposition. At the same time, the officials said, some rebel groups have prevented civilians from leaving and even killed or kidnapped those who demanded that insurgents leave their neighborhoods. The United Nations reports largely reflect what residents of East Aleppo have told The New York Times in recent days as Syrian government forces retook control of most of the city. Several have said family members were detained, arrested or conscripted after crossing into   areas, and one resident recounted how rebels in the Bustan   neighborhood stopped people from leaving. Other residents, however, said rebels had helped them cross the front lines or warned them not to go at certain times or in certain places because of the danger. Rebel groups inside east Aleppo are fragmented and do not always act in concert. As government forces continued to advance on Friday, panic was growing among those still trapped inside, who either could not make their way out or were afraid to enter government territory. More than 10, 500 people have left   areas in the last 24 hours, Russian officials said on Friday, nearly half of them children, while others have moved deeper into the   district under intense bombardment. At the same time, government forces have escorted hundreds of the displaced back to recently retaken districts, such as the Bab   district below. But those areas are heavily damaged, and officials have told families to move into any available abandoned apartments. In areas the government has recently retaken, like this one south of Aleppo, it has placed posters of President Bashar   amid rubble and handed out Syrian government flags. Many people who escaped eastern Aleppo have been filmed thanking government troops and their ally, Russia, and chanting praise for Mr. Assad. In the newly retaken Bab   neighborhood, a man greeted a   fighter. But for those viewed as opposing the government and men wanted for army service, there is a riskier side to entering government territory. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said family members had reported that they had lost contact with men aged 30 to 50, echoing several interviews The Times conducted in which Aleppo residents said their males relatives were arrested or forced to join the army. “Given the terrible record of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances by the Syrian government, we are of course deeply concerned about the fate of these individuals,” Mr. Colville said. He also said that two members of the   forces that took over Aleppo’s   neighborhood were reported to have summarily shot four men in front of their families on Sunday because they were suspected of working with the opposition. The last two weeks have seen the fiercest bombardments yet of   districts. Those still inside describe chaos and intense crowding in some areas as people scramble for shelter. They said wounded people and bodies were left in the streets with no one to help them. Here, what is believed to be the charred body of a rebel fighter can be seen in retaken Bab  . Mr. Colville said the agency had heard reports that two armed opposition groups had abducted and killed an unknown number of civilians who asked them to leave their neighborhoods. He added that residents trying to leave the Bustan   neighborhood may have come under fire from armed opposition groups, something that could amount to the war crime of  . “Civilians are caught between warring parties that appear to be operating in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” Mr. Colville said. “All sides are deeply culpable. ” The government has retaken most of the medieval Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site severely damaged by years of fighting. At its center is the citadel, which the government has held and used as a fortress throughout the conflict. The government’s offensive over the last week has left rebels in east Aleppo facing   defeat. On Friday, Russian officials said that 93 percent of Aleppo had been captured by the Syrian Army. There has been some talk of at least a temporary   to allow for evacuation of the city, but on Friday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that military operations “will go on until bandits leave eastern Aleppo. ” Mr. Lavrov said he still had hope of reaching a final resolution for the city in talks with the United States, but Jan Egeland, the United Nations’ humanitarian chief, on Thursday described the two countries as being “poles apart. ” At the United Nations on Friday, Russia suffered a sharp diplomatic blow when a large majority of members voted for a mildly worded, legally nonbinding General Assembly resolution calling for a pause in fighting and access to humanitarian aid in Syria. In practice, the resolution means little, with no specifics and no force of law. So Syria and Russia, which lobbied vigorously against the resolution, can continue their military operations, including those on the   parts of Aleppo. The resolution, advanced by Canada, received 122 votes in favor and 13 against.   members abstained. The no votes included Syria, its chief allies Iran and Russia, along with China, Cuba and Venezuela. It comes days after Russia, along with China, defeated a resolution in the Security Council that would have imposed a   cessation of hostilities to allow aid into besieged parts of Aleppo and allow residents to get out.",0,934,25.243243243243242,37,0.38436830835117775,0,0,0,0,96.39486551991905,56.997830121341906,81.28786388101165,2.689037145226573,0.8308351177730193,0.009635974304068522,0.032119914346895075,0.018201284796573874,0.048179871520342615,0.029978586723768737,0.12419700214132762,0.020342612419700215,0.0032119914346895075,0.0032119914346895075,0.07494646680942184,0,0.061027837259100645,0.006423982869379015,0.0021413276231263384,0.016059957173447537,0.0053533190578158455,0.08244111349036402,0,0.06209850107066381,0.023554603854389723,0.05032119914346895,0,0.004282655246252677,0.022483940042826552,0.0053533190578158455,0.1252676659528908,0,0.0053533190578158455,0.0021413276231263384,0,0,0.004282655246252677,0.06423982869379015,0.008565310492505354,0.008565310492505354,0.42398286937901497,0.004282655246252677,0.019271948608137045,0.018201284796573874,0,0.03961456102783726,0,0,0.018201284796573874,0.01284796573875803,0.007494646680942184,0.014989293361884369,0,0.023554603854389723,0.007494646680942184,0.03640256959314775,0,0,0.020342612419700215,0.215203426124197,0.0010706638115631692,0,0.02462526766595289,0.047109207708779445,0.06316916488222699,0.021413276231263382,0.010706638115631691,0.07387580299785867,0.16595289079229122,0.061027837259100645,0.02462526766595289,0,0.010706638115631691,0.18843683083511778,0.0010706638115631692,0.007494646680942184,0.009635974304068522,0.004282655246252677,0.0032119914346895075,0,0,0.0032119914346895075,0.11777301927194861,0.11777301927194861,0,0.022483940042826552,0.017130620985010708,0.05032119914346895,0.1252676659528908,0.12955032119914348,0.0010706638115631692,0.03640256959314775,0,8,0,158.25,0,6,0,9,17,6,130.85,26,5,27,3,8,0,78,19,285.1,374.6,78,,0.22725373985172645,0,0.8533162058890822,0,0.18070688367162685,0,0.2485985874920151,0.3845897944501221,0.18070688367162685,0.8278871570351612,0.48869478834754765,0.15526532180049568,0.49812795197399456,0.09932807531109802,0.5405136881722944,0,0.06437768240343349,0.015681743149554308,0.23530868273357547,0.30917794651700237,-0.9150138006860203,0.6908220534829976,97
347,"OTTAWA  —   The entire community of Fort McMurray, the heart of Alberta’s oil sands region, was ordered to evacuate on Tuesday night as a   wildfire advanced on the city and cut off its only highway link to the south. The fire destroyed a number of homes in one neighborhood and some trailers in a trailer park, said Robin Smith, a spokesman for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. According to television news reports, commercial buildings downtown were also ablaze. There were no reports of injuries by early evening. A video  showed flames and smoke rising hundreds of feet into the sky, prompting the largest fire evacuation in Alberta’s history, The Edmonton Journal reported. The fire was expected to get worse on Wednesday, when winds were forecast to switch direction and increase in speed. Mr. Smith said early Tuesday that Highway 63, which connects Fort McMurray to Edmonton, Alberta, to the south and the main oil sands production areas to the north, was heavily congested with cars fleeing the fire, which began over the weekend. Late in the afternoon, however, the fire jumped over the highway, making evacuation to the south impossible, Mr. Smith said. He added that there was no immediate danger in areas north of Fort McMurray. The highway was later reopened. As of early Tuesday evening, the city’s airport was open, but some airlines were canceling flights, said Jillian Philipp, an airport spokeswoman. After leaving the airport earlier in the day, Ms. Philipp said she was unable to return because of the fire. But employees still there told her that it did not appear to be in the immediate path of the flames. The provincial government had ordered residents out of six neighborhoods and a trailer park by late in the afternoon after declaring the fire “out of control. ” The fire had consumed about 6, 500 acres of forest by late Monday night and increased substantially in size by Tuesday, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the provincial government. Ms. Stewart said that strong, changing winds were shifting the fire’s direction, making it unsafe for firefighters on the ground. As a result, their efforts had been limited to aerial water bombing. A photograph posted by the government showed only a relatively small line of trees and a hill separating a commercial district from a tower of flame. Until last year, the oil sands had made Fort McMurray Canada’s boomtown, where the biggest concern was dealing with frenetic growth and the housing shortages and social problems it created. The collapse of oil prices, however, has hit the city particularly hard. Oil sands companies have been laying off workers as projects are completed, but no major oil sands projects have shut down. Last year, the regional municipality had a population of about 125, 000, excluding thousands of workers who officially claimed residency elsewhere but who commuted by air to Fort McMurray and lived in work camps.",0,494,22.454545454545453,22,0.34615384615384615,0,0,0,0,98.23593840370157,55.708987854251006,59.596599190283406,14.5714022819286,0.7975708502024291,0.016194331983805668,0.0465587044534413,0.030364372469635626,0.016194331983805668,0.008097165991902834,0.1437246963562753,0.0020242914979757085,0,0.010121457489878543,0.11133603238866396,0,0.05465587044534413,0.01417004048582996,0.006072874493927126,0.018218623481781375,0.006072874493927126,0.05668016194331984,0,0.07489878542510121,0.022267206477732792,0.05060728744939271,0,0,0.018218623481781375,0.006072874493927126,0.07692307692307693,0,0,0.030364372469635626,0.008097165991902834,0,0.0020242914979757085,0.08704453441295547,0.004048582995951417,0.004048582995951417,0.42105263157894735,0.006072874493927126,0.022267206477732792,0.012145748987854251,0,0.02631578947368421,0,0.004048582995951417,0.0020242914979757085,0.01417004048582996,0.006072874493927126,0.006072874493927126,0.0020242914979757085,0.022267206477732792,0.008097165991902834,0.012145748987854251,0,0,0.018218623481781375,0.19635627530364372,0.0020242914979757085,0,0.07489878542510121,0.05263157894736842,0.05668016194331984,0.008097165991902834,0.004048582995951417,0.04048582995951417,0.15384615384615385,0.03441295546558704,0.008097165991902834,0,0.004048582995951417,0.21052631578947367,0,0.006072874493927126,0.012145748987854251,0,0.010121457489878543,0,0,0.006072874493927126,0.05060728744939271,0.11336032388663968,0,0.006072874493927126,0.0020242914979757085,0.07489878542510121,0.11133603238866396,0.11133603238866396,0,0.03643724696356275,0,8,0,36,0.375,0,0,0,7,1,48.625,3,0,4,0,8,0,11,0,62,73,11,,0.2760888715617666,0,0.6318430249036108,0.017563434589239202,0,0,0,0.250212886812842,0.045503819962193694,0.698623243477154,0.12512420160141322,0,0.16015261286229274,0,0.30888423244028484,0,0.02040816326530612,0,0.1150278293135436,0.13543599257884972,-0.7746945629215634,0.8645640074211502,28
348,"Syria This October 19, 2016 photo provided by Norwegian Armed Forces shows a plane taking off from Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov (R) with helicopters escorting nuclear-powered battle cruiser Pyotr Veliky (L) southwest of the city of Trondheim in international waters on its way to the Mediterranean. A fleet of Russian warships has entered the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria amid speculations that Moscow and Damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. The commander of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov told state-owned Russia-1 television network on Saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the “designated zone... in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast.” Captain 1st rank Sergei Artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carrier’s deck to survey the conflict zone. “Flights are being carried out from the deck... they are working on coordination with the shore port. The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,” the high-ranking Russian naval commander pointed out. The remarks came a day after Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that Russian MiG and Sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the Syrian airspace to “determine combat missions.” Meanwhile, the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, Captain 1st rank Vladislav Malakhovsky, said on Saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to “come closer than 50 kilometers” away from the Russian fleet. This file photo shows Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich on its way to the Mediterranean. (Photo by Reuters) On November 4, Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich passed through the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey and arrived off the Syrian coast. Grigorovich is reportedly capable of launching land-attack Kalibr cruise missiles, which are equivalent to US Tomahawk ones and equipped with the latest high precision guidance systems. Russia has been bombing Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, terror groups in Syria since September 30, 2015 at the official request of President Bashar al-Assad. Backed by Russia’s aerial campaign, the Syrian troops have retaken several militant-held areas in the Arab country. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura estimates that over 400,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Loading ...

349,"On Sunday’s broadcast of on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemed to be violating his recusal over Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election by participating in the firing and replacement of FBI Director James Comey.  Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: As you know, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions who had said he would recuse himself for anything having to do with the probes raised eyebrows when he participated very directly in the firing of Comey, and then there are questions about him interviewing candidates to replace Comey, but what do you think about Sessions claim to have recused himself? Do you think he should be investigated by the senate and should it be investigated by the inspector general at DOJ? yes. SCHUMER: Yes. I have asked the inspector general and the request I’ve made is not only to look into any interference to thwart the investigation but whether Attorney General Sessions should have participated in the firing of Comey and should participate in FBI director. You know Attorney General Sessions has a higher obligation. He didn’t tell the truth meeting with the Russians so he recused himself. He seems to be violating that recusal that seems on its face to be part of this. And look, I called for him to step down when he didn’t tell the truth about the Russians because it’s the highest law in enforcement officer in the land. If the actions of the last week make all the more reason he should not be attorney general.

350,"A movement is growing to bring together women across race, creed and political beliefs by luring them off social media and arranging for them to meet in person. It’s a nice idea, but there’s one catch: The Women’s March on Washington is being organized on Facebook, the nation’s preferred platform to battle over race, gender, politics and just about everything else. The timing of the event, which organizers began planning the morning after the election but are careful not to call a protest, is aimed at the coming administration of   Donald J. Trump. More than 100, 000 people have said on Facebook that they will travel to the capital to participate. The plan is to walk from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21, 2017, the morning after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “We’re doing it his very first day in office because we are making a statement,” one organizer, Breanne Butler, said. “The marginalized groups you attacked during your campaign? We are here and we are watching. And, like, ‘Welcome to the White House.’ ” Since Election Day, there has been momentum around supporting groups that are opposed to Mr. Trump’s espoused views on women and minority groups. Nonprofit organizations, including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, have reported a surge in donations after the election. But the election taught Americans that women are deeply divided along party lines, education level and race: 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit poll data. On the march group’s Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the “women’s vote,” an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend. Evvie Harmon, a yoga teacher from Greenville, S. C. who is helping   efforts to organize for the march, said the group had nixed a possible idea for a slogan  —   “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights”  —   because it was something that Mrs. Clinton once said. “This is not an   protest,” Ms. Harmon said. “This is the reaction of women and minorities across the world who are very disturbed by the rhetoric that was said over the last year and a half. ” Aside from dueling political views, organizers are trying to take feedback from a cacophony of voices in real time as they try to assemble a network of state volunteers, plan programming and arrange transportation and lodging for the event. Ms. Butler, a chef who is organizing the event in her spare time, said the march had no official means of funding yet. There are women on the page who have said that the march is not inclusive enough, and that they don’t want an event organized by white women. Ms. Butler acknowledged the criticism but stressed that the women who are organizing are from different racial and religious backgrounds. (There was even controversy over the original name: Organizers have changed the name from Million Woman March to the Women’s March on Washington because observers took issue with the fact that the original name echoed a black women’s march held in Philadelphia in 1997.) Ms. Butler, 27, said the greater concern would be helping local groups raise money to help women who can’t afford to travel to Washington. “The reality is that it’s incredibly expensive to fly to D. C. on inauguration weekend,” Ms. Butler said. “We don’t want only an   class of people at this march because no one else can afford to go. ” Tabitha St.   34, who plans to help sign up attendees by visiting churches, synagogues and community centers in New York City, said she had been working to include all types of people  —   including those who have not been on Facebook lately. “I am a woman of color and I am an immigrant,” said Ms. St.   who lives in Brooklyn. She said of the march: “For me, it has been completely inclusive. ” This is all plenty of pressure for a     movement without a concrete path to funding itself, but organizers are optimistic as they look ahead to January. According to Ms. Butler, the group’s request for a permit to march is still pending. On Friday, Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an email that the group’s request to march is one of at least 13 requests currently under review for areas the agency administers in the nation’s capital. Those also include rallies and demonstrations. Mr. Litterst said the Park Service was also reviewing five requests for official inauguration events.",0,878,19.954545454545453,44,0.2972665148063781,0,0,0,0,94.61470875366092,21.603019339854395,87.7292083120264,40.06533029612756,0.8246013667425968,0.014806378132118452,0.03302961275626424,0.025056947608200455,0.02847380410022779,0.03644646924829157,0.1867881548974943,0.0056947608200455585,0.003416856492027335,0.023917995444191344,0.08997722095671981,0.0011389521640091116,0.07630979498861047,0.0011389521640091116,0,0.015945330296127564,0.00683371298405467,0.0683371298405467,0.004555808656036446,0.06492027334851937,0.01366742596810934,0.04100227790432802,0,0.0011389521640091116,0.02050113895216401,0.00683371298405467,0.10933940774487472,0,0.002277904328018223,0,0.03416856492027335,0,0.009111617312072893,0.04441913439635535,0,0,0.45671981776765375,0.0011389521640091116,0.022779043280182234,0.002277904328018223,0.003416856492027335,0.05011389521640091,0.0011389521640091116,0,0.012528473804100227,0.015945330296127564,0.011389521640091117,0.00683371298405467,0.0056947608200455585,0.018223234624145785,0.012528473804100227,0.010250569476082005,0.0011389521640091116,0,0.02164009111617312,0.21981776765375854,0.003416856492027335,0.0011389521640091116,0.03644646924829157,0.06378132118451026,0.06492027334851937,0.023917995444191344,0.018223234624145785,0.05011389521640091,0.1548974943052392,0.07403189066059225,0.017084282460136675,0.0011389521640091116,0.023917995444191344,0.1378132118451025,0.003416856492027335,0.0056947608200455585,0.0056947608200455585,0,0.01366742596810934,0,0,0.004555808656036446,0.14464692482915717,0.06492027334851937,0,0.007972665148063782,0.007972665148063782,0.05466970387243736,0.13553530751708429,0.13325740318906606,0.0056947608200455585,0.04100227790432802,0.002277904328018223,17,0,30.725,10,2,0,7,11,1,24.5,25,8.725,12,0,17,0,56.725,7,73.225,129.95,56.725,,0.36430033354061775,0,0.508778023423325,0.2521127429279827,0.06316163001913848,0,0.19091884192380093,0.2705042601214877,0.03261068708575956,0.4523233306000893,0.4573327400375149,0.22727394712592824,0.2880129448105867,0,0.19091884192380093,0,0.05896876137013358,0.007276885493008992,0.0761214200322262,0.13509018140235976,-0.44027970131833083,0.8649098185976403,46
351,"  actress Zoe Saldana says Donald Trump won the election, thanks, in part, to “arrogant” celebrities whose personal insults created sympathy for the Republican candidate and galvanized his supporters. [“We got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,” the   told AFP.  Saldana, the face of multiple blockbuster film franchises —  Star Trek, Avatar, and Guardians of the Galazy —  says celebrities demonizing Trump only emboldened the voters who believed in him. “We were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong   …     and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises,” she said. While she did not support Trump’s candidacy, Saldana says, “I’m learning from (Trump’s victory) with a lot of humility. ” She said she is hopeful that America under Trump will not become the racially segregated society that it once was. “If we have people continue to be strong and educate ourselves and stand by equal rights and treat everyone with respect, we won’t go back to those times,” Saldana said. The    actress is but one of a growing number of stars who have condemned the cockiness of celebrities during the campaign and now insists that Americans rally around Trump. “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t [talk about politics] Patriots Day star Mark Wahlberg told Task  Purpose about a month after the election. “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble. ” “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyway. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills. ” Last week, actress Nicole Kidman said, “[Trump is] now elected and we, as a country, need to support whoever is the president. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.",0,317,21.133333333333333,15,0.305993690851735,0,0,0,0,68.5163683770038,4.36407555105847,93.8828015812802,61.668163067216696,0.8170347003154574,0.01892744479495268,0.031545741324921134,0.031545741324921134,0.05993690851735016,0.03470031545741325,0.22082018927444794,0.0031545741324921135,0,0.025236593059936908,0.06624605678233439,0,0.07886435331230283,0.00946372239747634,0.0031545741324921135,0.00946372239747634,0.00946372239747634,0.0914826498422713,0,0.06309148264984227,0.00946372239747634,0.05993690851735016,0,0,0.022082018927444796,0.012618296529968454,0.10725552050473186,0,0,0.0031545741324921135,0.012618296529968454,0.0031545741324921135,0.012618296529968454,0.05993690851735016,0.0031545741324921135,0.0031545741324921135,0.48580441640378547,0.0031545741324921135,0.025236593059936908,0,0.0031545741324921135,0.056782334384858045,0.006309148264984227,0.0031545741324921135,0.025236593059936908,0.012618296529968454,0.03785488958990536,0.01892744479495268,0.012618296529968454,0.015772870662460567,0.022082018927444796,0.01892744479495268,0.0031545741324921135,0,0.00946372239747634,0.24921135646687698,0.025236593059936908,0.0031545741324921135,0.03470031545741325,0.050473186119873815,0.05993690851735016,0.08201892744479496,0.03785488958990536,0.04416403785488959,0.12302839116719243,0.138801261829653,0.028391167192429023,0,0.05362776025236593,0.09779179810725552,0,0.00946372239747634,0.00946372239747634,0,0.006309148264984227,0,0,0.028391167192429023,0.1608832807570978,0.04416403785488959,0,0.025236593059936908,0.00946372239747634,0.04100946372239748,0.17034700315457413,0.17665615141955837,0.022082018927444796,0.015772870662460567,0.01892744479495268,13,0,29,0,0,0,8,23,1.83,0,1,14.5,7,0,13,0,41.33,10,49,99.33,41.33,,0.4287527098011759,0,0.626072580046258,0,0,0,0.31594942629453465,0.5704293199089878,0.09555882239610927,0,0.054583639049126324,0.4556809704455399,0.2878229343817586,0,0,0,0.10753779304243749,0.026019306325293368,0.1274946009939375,0.258449769729139,-0.38508948159816964,0.741550230270861,32
352,"Videos ‘Anti-Establishment’ Trump Plans to Appoint Goldman Sachs and George Soros Insiders “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. Contrary to his anti-establishment stance — which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton — Donald Trump’s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election. Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump’s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs — and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management — conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee’s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians. “It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,” Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump’s curious choice for Treasury Secretary. According to Fox Business Network , Trump’s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he’s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary. Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate: “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” Zero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton. Further substantiating his establishing banking insider status — the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe — Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT’s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like “Avatar.” If Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties don’t trouble Trump’s supporters enough, the hedge fund manager’s links to George Soros — an ardent Clinton fan — certainly will. In fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible — and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump. “Steven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,” Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. “He brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.” Indeed, Trump’s campaign, quoted by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin “has previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.” While business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former’s links to the left. Despite the nominee’s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump’s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities — particularly as darlings of the establishment. Should you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric — from any politician — only constitutes so much hot air.

353,"Statins my disrupt vascular function On the Greenmedinfo.com Statin Research database we have cataloged over 15 studies from the National Library of Medicine indicating the heart-damaging properties of this class of supposedly ‘heart friendly’ drugs. View our professional data page here , or if you are not a member, view the open access reference page for public view and linking here . Statins do not only reduce lipoprotein production but have so-called pleoitropic properties, which include immune system down-regulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which is why they are believed to have a small benefit in reducing the inflammatory burden caused by autoimmune processes in the artery that can precipitate myocardial infarction (heart attack) in some individuals — but not without having the unintended, adverse effect of increasing cancer risk (at all sites) and contributing to congestive heart failure, effectively cancelling out the small, mostly theoretical benefit of reduced heart attack risk. For instance, it has been estimated that “…at least 23,000 low-risk people would have to take statins for five years to prevent one death from heart disease.” [ Source ] Statins are also clearly diabetogenic , increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes by about 50% in some populations , with the FDA now requiring drug manufacturers to include a warning of diabetes risk on statin drug labels . Considering morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes is caused not by the elevated blood sugar in and of itself, but the damage glycated sugar does to the vascular system and the subsequent cardiovascular harm it produces, the case against using statins for primary and secondary prevention of heart disease seems clear as day. Moreover, cardiovascular harm is not the only concern. Statin drugs have been linked to over 300 adverse health effects. We issued a consumer alert on the topic several years ago . For the more technically minded, here is the database page on Statin drugs listing 300+ adverse health effects based on 465 published studies. Heart Disease Is Not Caused By A Lack of A Drug Should we be surprised to find so much research on this drug class’s adverse health effects? After all, cholesterol is fundamental for the health of each cell in the human body, and low cholesterol has been found to cause a wide range of health problems , including psychiatric states such as violence against self and other. The food and drug industries have used cholesterol phobia to manipulate health professionals and the lay public into believing that the cause of heart disease is genetic, and can only be addressed through the use of synthetic, patented, essentially toxic chemicals, i.e. pharmaceuticals, or eating semi-synthetic ‘low fat,’‘low cholesterol’ foods with very little nutritional value. This latest study speaks to why we must exercise the precautionary principle when considering taking a patented chemical – technically a xenobiotic alien to human physiology – for suppressing a symptom of a much deeper and more complex problem. While oxidized cholesterol forms a significant part of the problem of atherosclerotic build-up in the arteries, it is not the primary cause of the damage to the inner lining of the arteries (endothelium), and the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction that can go on for many decades silently in the background. Ox-LDL deposits in atheromatous lesions have been viewed as an epiphenomenon, generated as part of a cascade of immune-mediated events the body activates in order to attempt to heal arterial damage. In certain respects, cholesterol deposits in the arteries at the site of damage can be likened to a Band-Aid. Do we blame the Band-Aid for causing the injury upon which it is placed? It is important to point out that oxidized cholesterol (ox-LDL) can be toxic and harmful to the vascular system, but the problem with modern blood testing for ‘cholesterol’ is that it does not take into the quality of the lipoproteins, only their quantitative dimensions. Depending on one’s diet, environmental factors, and overall bodily health, LDL particles will oxidize at different rates. If you are eating an antioxidant rich diet, full of healthy fats, phytocompounds, etc., your properly functioning LDL will be less susceptible to conversion to ox-LDL. On the other hand, eating a diet full of non-essential, oxidized fats, deficient in phytonutrients, antioxidants, etc. – and adding in environmental toxins and toxicants, e.g. smoking – will produce more ox-LDL, rendering it artherogenic. Obviously, therefore, diet and lifestyle form the basis for a sound preventive approach if the ‘ lipid hypothesis ‘ of cardiovascular disease is even deemed truly relevant. [For more research on natural substances which inhibit cholesterol oxidation, view our database on the topic: Prevent Cholesterol Oxidation .] Furthermore, there are many ways to address underlying vascular pathologies without suppressing the production of a vital building block and signaling molecule, which is what cholesterol is. Pomegranate , chocolate , and many other natural substances, have been confirmed in research to have profound heart disease preventive and reversing properties . You can explore our database sections relevant to the topic within our Heart Health guide , to find hundreds of studies proving this point. Basic nutritional incompatibilities, including the consumption of wheat which has cardiotoxic properties in genetically susceptible individuals, and excessive consumption of omega-6 versus omega-3 fats can profoundly increase the risk of heart disease. One groundbreaking study published last year, in fact, indicates that statins actually reduce the health benefits of omega-3 fats in the diet – adding another mechanism by which statin drugs exert heart disease promoting effects . Beyond the Pharmaceutically-Driven Medical Paradigm If statin drugs are toxic to human sperm, and if the men within whom this statin-induced damage is occurring are of reproductive age, the implications of this latest study on statins and fertility are potentially devastating to the health of future generations. Changes in our species germlines – sperm or egg – are carried on to future generations, possibly forever. With recent research indicating that even changes to somatic cells in this lifetime are capable of transferring information to the sperm , what we do here and now – our chemical exposures, our nutritional status, and even our psychospiritual and mental orientation (which gear into real physiological and genetic/epigenetic processes – can have critical and irreversible affects on our offspring. Clearly, the time has come both to re-evaluate the role of pharmaceuticals in ‘preventive’ health care, as well as the effects these novel new chemical compounds will have on the next generation, and the next.

354,"Wednesday during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump addressed the resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.  Trump said, “General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very very unfairly by the media. As I call the fake media in many cases. I think it is a sad thing he was treated so badly. In addition to that, from intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are leaked. It is a criminal action. It’s a criminal act. It has been going on for a long time, before me. Now, it is really going on. People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. I think that it is very, very unfair what happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated and the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked. Very very unfair. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,163,11.642857142857142,14,0.3067484662576687,0,0,0,0,70.28834355828221,20.01351965462395,54.873053327041056,1,0.7852760736196319,0.012269938650306749,0.0736196319018405,0.05521472392638037,0.0736196319018405,0.006134969325153374,0.17177914110429449,0,0.006134969325153374,0.006134969325153374,0.07975460122699386,0,0.11042944785276074,0,0,0,0,0.03067484662576687,0,0.06748466257668712,0.018404907975460124,0.03067484662576687,0,0,0.006134969325153374,0,0.06134969325153374,0,0,0.006134969325153374,0,0,0.012269938650306749,0.049079754601226995,0,0,0.5153374233128835,0,0.006134969325153374,0,0.03680981595092025,0.08588957055214724,0.006134969325153374,0,0.018404907975460124,0.006134969325153374,0.006134969325153374,0.024539877300613498,0,0.024539877300613498,0,0.05521472392638037,0.006134969325153374,0,0,0.25153374233128833,0.006134969325153374,0,0.012269938650306749,0.07975460122699386,0.04294478527607362,0.05521472392638037,0.018404907975460124,0.03680981595092025,0.12269938650306748,0.1411042944785276,0.006134969325153374,0,0.012269938650306749,0.1165644171779141,0.006134969325153374,0,0.012269938650306749,0.018404907975460124,0,0,0,0.018404907975460124,0.05521472392638037,0.06134969325153374,0,0.006134969325153374,0,0.03067484662576687,0.15950920245398773,0.1656441717791411,0,0.03067484662576687,0,8,0,63.03125,0,0,0,0,8.75,0,32.625,4,6,1,0,8,0,16,0,88.78125,104.78125,16,,0.3234518715067226,0,0.7902173158674858,0,0,0,0,0.3433634636852263,0,0.6609843885965818,0.19292728076790167,0.26393116059052896,0.05639139975154663,0,0.5444665782197481,0,0.06405604904291255,0,0.35543600650569246,0.419492055548605,-0.8601621229204565,0.580507944451395,18
355,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Peña combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Peña, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called “One Dark Night,” was recently shown at Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. “This is immersive journalism,” she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Peña by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. “One Dark Night” is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I’m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it’s meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I’ve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman’s position. We’re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what’s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

[YouTube | Kevin Lowe] Among those most pleased by the return of rain to California have been wild mushroom enthusiasts. Years of drought put a damper on the foraging of fungus in the state’s forests, a hobby that has burgeoned with the growing popularity of fresh, local food. Amateur clubs up and down the state are organized around both the culinary and scientific celebration of California’s many mushroom species. As the rainfall began to surge last October, so did the autumn mushrooms, said Debbie Viess, a   of the Bay Area Mycological Society. “We had a tremendous year for porcinis,” she said, “and it’s been a really good year for chanterelles too. ” Even with the continuing rain, several mushroom experts were wary about making predictions for the spring season, when popular morel mushrooms are normally abundant. While water is necessary, it isn’t sufficient, said Patrick Hamilton, a longtime mushroom picker in Sonoma County. “There are so many things, from soil conditions, to climatic conditions, to the age of the trees, all these things are difficult to understand,” he said. But the mystery, he added, “is part of the fun. ” California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.

356,"LaGRANGE, Ga.  —   Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway  —   about how, almost 77 years ago, he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men, then shot and left for dead. Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway  —   long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past  —   were acknowledged in this city of 31, 000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally   church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened. ” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical. ” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala. documented 4, 075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. The group has begun construction of a memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, which could open by March 2018. To Chief Dekmar, however, the apology in the town he has called home since 1995 is about more than righting history’s wrongs. It is also an effort, in the age of the Black Lives Matter movement, to address some of the deepest roots of minority mistrust in the police, and create a better working relationship between officers and the community. “It became clear that something needed to be done to recognize that some things we did in the past are a burden still carried by officers today,” Chief Dekmar said in a recent phone interview. “Institutions are made up of people, and relationships go like this: Before you trust somebody, you need to know that they know that they did you wrong, and that you’re stepping up and apologizing for it. ” Chief Dekmar, 61, a New Jersey native raised in Oregon, embraces a view of law enforcement that extends beyond the narrow goals of protecting the good and locking up the bad. He tends to speak about his department as one organ of a broader social body, though one that is perhaps more exposed than others to its ills. He leads regular meetings of a “community outreach committee” in which he shares with other civic leaders what his officers see on the streets  —   homelessness, juvenile delinquency, children with learning and literacy issues  —   and looks for ways that various   entities might work together to solve them. He has also sought to address trust issues: The department, he said, has mandated the use of body cameras on officers for the last five years. The chief became familiar with the lynching of Mr. Callaway only about two or three years ago, when one of his officers overheard two older   women who were looking at old photos of the LaGrange police on display at the headquarters building. One woman said to the other, “They killed our people. ” Chief Dekmar began researching the episode but found, he said, only “sketchy reports”  —   there was “no investigation I could find, no arrest, no   by the media. ” Indeed, the details of the crime appear to have been deliberately obscured for the   residents of LaGrange. Then, in 2014, Jason M. McGraw, a student at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, wrote a research paper about the lynching. He noted that while newspapers around the country had reported that a band of masked whites had abducted Mr. Callaway, the local paper, The LaGrange Daily News, wrote only that Mr. Callaway had died “as a result of bullets fired by an unknown person or group of individuals. ” The paper’s headline on the Sept. 9, 1940, article declared, “Negro Succumbs to Shot Wounds. ” Mr. Callaway is generally believed to have been 16 or 18 years old on Sept. 7, the day he was arrested and charged with trying to assault a white woman. According to Mr. McGraw’s research, six white men arrived at the jail that night with at least one gun, forced the jailer to open the cell and forced Mr. Callaway into a car. He was driven to a spot eight miles away and shot in the head and arms. He was later found by a roadside and taken to a hospital, where he died. Mr. McGraw noted that the investigation of Mr. Callaway’s death fell to the town’s police chief, J. E. Matthews, and the Troup County sheriff, E. V. Hillyer, but that an investigative report was never made public. Chief Dekmar has learned that generations of   were well aware of what happened. “There are relatives here and people who still remember,” he said. “Even if those people are not still alive, down through the generations, that memory is still alive. That’s a burden that officers carry. ” As Chief Dekmar learned more about the case, he decided that something must be done to acknowledge it. The city he has sworn to protect is less than 70 miles southwest of Atlanta. Before the Civil War, LaGrange was a wealthy hub in Georgia’s cotton kingdom: Troup County, of which LaGrange is the seat, had the state’s   number of slaves. Today, according to recent census figures, the city is about 48 percent black and 45 percent white. A Kia plant in nearby West Point, Ga. suggests an economic future for the area beyond the textile industry that once sustained it. But nearly one in three LaGrange residents live in poverty. Residents say race relations here, as in many multicultural American communities, run the gamut from friendly to frayed, depending on the day and the issue. When LaGrange College, a private liberal arts school in town, announced that it had invited Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. event scheduled for Thursday, protests poured in, in part because Mr. Lewis had questioned the legitimacy of President Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, some businesses around town bore signs promoting Mr. Lewis’s appearance, while some homes featured   signs declaring “Back the Blue. ” For the last two years or so, city and county residents, including Chief Dekmar, have been engaged in a program of racial reconciliation and racial  . At a monthly meeting this summer, Chief Dekmar approached the president of the county N. A. A. C. P. chapter, Ernest Ward, and asked if he would help set up a public apology for the lynching. Mr. Ward served on the police force for nearly two decades starting in the  . He acknowledged that some of his fellow black residents harbored an    attitude toward the police. “I lost many friends when I became a police officer,” he said, “because they felt that I sold out. ” He was asked how much the apology would help with    police work. “I believe it’s a start,” he said. “And it’s helped me to have a newfound respect for Chief Dekmar. ” “Historically certain people in the white race don’t like to bring up the past when it may not show a good light on their ancestors,” Mr. Ward said. “And so they would prefer to keep things hidden. ” Chief Dekmar issued his apology to relatives of Mr. Callaway on Thursday night at Warren Temple United Methodist Church here. The month after the shooting, Mr. McGraw noted, a church minister named L. W. Strickland wrote to Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who was then a lawyer for the N. A. A. C. P. telling him that the local branch of the rights group had asked the authorities to look into the case, but that “nothing is being done  —   not even acknowledgment of our requests. ” Some white LaGrange residents said on Thursday that they were deeply skeptical about whether the apology would have any practical effect. They noted that the crime took place before most people here were even born. “I don’t care if they apologize or don’t,” said Jessie East, 74, who works at a furniture and appliance shop. “It’s not going to change a thing that happened 77 years ago. ” But to others, including one of Mr. Callaway’s relatives, the apology was a step toward healing. “I speak your name, Austin Callaway, and ask God for forgiveness for the people that did this inhumane thing to you,” Deborah Tatum, a descendant of Mr. Callaway, told the congregation. “Some might say ‘forgiveness’? And I say to you that I believe God when he tells us that there is power and freedom in forgiveness. ”",0,1524,17.517241379310345,87,0.3038057742782152,0,0,0,0,92.09949460542784,19.985564304461942,81.74356246009789,27.953893263342078,0.8372703412073491,0.01115485564304462,0.03412073490813648,0.03871391076115486,0.03280839895013123,0.02099737532808399,0.2020997375328084,0.003937007874015748,0.001968503937007874,0.014435695538057743,0.09645669291338582,0.0006561679790026247,0.05708661417322835,0.007217847769028871,0.0026246719160104987,0.014435695538057743,0.006561679790026247,0.08858267716535433,0.0026246719160104987,0.07414698162729659,0.019028871391076115,0.048556430446194225,0,0.012467191601049869,0.019028871391076115,0.010498687664041995,0.1010498687664042,0,0.001968503937007874,0.0006561679790026247,0.001968503937007874,0,0.006561679790026247,0.0662729658792651,0.001968503937007874,0.001968503937007874,0.45866141732283466,0.004593175853018373,0.013779527559055118,0.007217847769028871,0.007874015748031496,0.049868766404199474,0.0013123359580052493,0,0.024934383202099737,0.013779527559055118,0.0032808398950131233,0.03477690288713911,0.006561679790026247,0.011811023622047244,0.010498687664041995,0.015091863517060367,0,0.0006561679790026247,0.027559055118110236,0.21653543307086615,0.005249343832020997,0,0.03215223097112861,0.0688976377952756,0.07677165354330709,0.045275590551181105,0.016404199475065617,0.06430446194225722,0.14173228346456693,0.09514435695538058,0.02099737532808399,0.0006561679790026247,0.03608923884514436,0.13910761154855644,0.005905511811023622,0.005249343832020997,0.004593175853018373,0.001968503937007874,0.01706036745406824,0,0,0.02099737532808399,0.11876640419947507,0.07414698162729659,0,0.024934383202099737,0.007217847769028871,0.05380577427821522,0.12532808398950132,0.12401574803149606,0.004593175853018373,0.045931758530183726,0.004593175853018373,33.5,0,142.725,11,15,0,11,36,14.5,95.625,38.25,14,71.525,2,33.5,0,153.025,13,316.90000000000003,457.55,153.025,,0.4453999064008937,0,0.7738359896277663,0.20867596017388057,0.2644881903884002,0,0.20867596017388057,0.46324112669419626,0.2579460400874732,0.6962733262788391,0.4783443972664846,0.2512864645137292,0.6316325433513579,0.045752658098189423,0.617706508138408,0,0.08211478092887232,0.006975933031042902,0.1700517828874997,0.2455260121810523,-0.8474652422099545,0.7544739878189477,118
357,"LOS ANGELES  —   From the stars to the producers to the executives, no one involved with “The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story” seemed to realize the significance of where they were celebrating their triumphant Emmy night after the awards ceremony Sunday. They were all at an   at an event space called Vibiana, about two blocks from the courthouse where the Simpson case was tried. A couple of decades later, the case was recreated on this FX program, which won the Emmy for best limited series, capping a big night for the show. When the Fox executive Dana Walden heard about the proximity of the courthouse to the party, she said, “That just gave me chills,” a sentiment echoed by FX’s chief executive, John Landgraf, who called it “a little chilling. ” But there was one person who understood the odd coincidence of ending up back where it all started, after a circuitous and sometimes torturous route. “I know where I am,” Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, said, a little gravely. She was sitting on a couch, inches away from the actress Sarah Paulson, who was holding the Emmy she won for portraying Ms. Clark. Ms. Clark, who was Ms. Paulson’s guest at the Emmys, said she couldn’t help but think about how near the courthouse was on the ride over from the ceremony. It was a bitter reminder for Ms. Clark, who was ridiculed in the news media in the    —   the perception being that she had blown the prosecution and let Mr. Simpson go free. She has found her public comeback only in the last year, after the explosive popularity of the series and the sympathetic portrayal from Ms. Paulson, who in her acceptance speech for her best actress award offered up a moving public apology to Ms. Clark. “The world saw me in sound bites,” Ms. Clark said. “Now I feel like I’m more understood. ” As Ryan Murphy, the prolific television producer who shepherded this show, put it: “The great story tonight is Marcia Clark finally won. ” And so did FX. At the Emmys, it’s usually an HBO night, and to a certain extent it was again: The premium cable channel won the best drama and comedy categories for a second consecutive year with “Game of Thrones” and “Veep. ” It also broke Comedy Central’s hold on the variety category, with a victory by John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight. ’’ But propelled by a category that FX is reinventing  —   the limited series  —   the network arguably stole the show, smashing the basic cable Emmy record by winning 18 awards over all. The previous record was eight awards. The FX show also won acting Emmys for Courtney B. Vance’s portrayal of the defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran and Sterling K. Brown’s depiction of another prosecutor, Christopher Darden. (Louie Anderson won his first Emmy for his role as the mother of Zach Galifianakis’s character in FX’s “Baskets. ”) Mr. Landgraf has said in the past that he feels like he has to play “Moneyball” to compete with his rivals. Last month, he said his budget was about a sixth the size of Netflix’s. (Netflix’s programming budget is about $6 billion, HBO’s is $3 billion, and FX’s is about $1 billion.) But despite that, FX outshined them on Sunday. The success of the O. J. show wasn’t a sure thing. For decades, Hollywood did everything it could to stay away from the Bronco chase, Judge Lance A. Ito and the trial, in what proved to be a divisive national episode. “Like most things, it’s a   in retrospect, but it wasn’t at the time,” said Brad Simpson, a producer of the show, with his Emmy in hand. “There was such a heavy saturation of O. J. that nobody wanted to hear about it again. When we announced the show, all the comments were, ‘Oh lord, don’t put the country through this again.’ But the show touched on things that obsesses America: class, race, the criminal justice system. ” By turning it into a limited series, which requires a relatively easy time commitment, FX was able to attract actors including John Travolta, Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Schwimmer. (All were nominated for awards on Sunday night.) And though the Academy Awards have been criticized for their   lineup of acting nominees, the Emmys have done better with diversity: Three   won acting awards on Sunday, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown from “The People v. O. J. Simpson. ” “Actors and directors follow the writing,” Mr. Vance said at the party. “The writers in TV are writing for different hues of color. Hopefully the movies start to see that if you want to get the people, you better do the writing. ” Mr. Murphy, the producer, has been a regular at the Emmys (he’s the man behind shows including “Glee,” “ ” and “American Horror Story”) and he said that between the diversity onstage and the large number of   winners, Sunday night’s ceremony represented “a sea change. ” “I feel like sometimes you go to those award shows, and there are some people who win over and over again, but it wasn’t that type of night,” he said. “The Television Academy and the voters have moved onto a different feeling, a different embrace, and it felt good. ” There was arguably nobody who benefited more on Sunday night than Ms. Clark. Though Ms. Paulson was joined at the hip with Ms. Clark on Sunday, the two did not meet until late in production. They’ve become close since then, and Ms. Paulson provided one of the night’s stirring moments when she apologized to Ms. Clark during her acceptance speech, saying that the public in the 1990s was “superficial and careless. ” Ms. Clark seemed to be enjoying the rehabilitation of her reputation. “I think the benefit of this   was people got to see the fullness of everyone involved,” she said. “Not just me. Chris Darden, too. Everyone. As well as the historical context. I think everybody got more of what was going on, more than they did ever before. ” For two hours, Ms. Clark and Ms. Paulson sat cozily in a corner near Mr. Murphy and the “Narcos” star Pedro Pascal. At a little before midnight, Ms. Paulson got up to leave with Ms. Clark. As they walked through a courtyard, a group of young women were gawking at them, but they weren’t interested in the one holding the Emmy. “Oh my God, that’s Marcia Clark!” one woman said. Ms. Clark heard it, looked over, pointed triumphantly and waved. She walked out of the party and toward an S. U. V. with Ms. Paulson, and just a few blocks away from her first brush with fame, Ms. Clark finally had her Hollywood ending.",0,1143,15.875,72,0.2747156605424322,0,0,0,0,93.97052583616922,19.884303813875114,79.69850296490716,81.08266534250787,0.8092738407699037,0.031496062992125984,0.03674540682414698,0.03762029746281715,0.051618547681539804,0.009623797025371828,0.2440944881889764,0.005249343832020997,0.0017497812773403325,0.02537182852143482,0.1084864391951006,0.0008748906386701663,0.05861767279090114,0.003499562554680665,0.0017497812773403325,0.00699912510936133,0.012248468941382326,0.06824146981627296,0.004374453193350831,0.06824146981627296,0.02712160979877515,0.04636920384951881,0,0.0008748906386701663,0.020122484689413824,0.006124234470691163,0.09448818897637795,0.0008748906386701663,0.0008748906386701663,0.007874015748031496,0.03412073490813648,0,0.004374453193350831,0.0752405949256343,0.0017497812773403325,0.0017497812773403325,0.46981627296587924,0.0017497812773403325,0.016622922134733157,0.0008748906386701663,0.009623797025371828,0.048118985126859144,0.008748906386701663,0,0.020122484689413824,0.01837270341207349,0.020122484689413824,0.016622922134733157,0.003499562554680665,0.013123359580052493,0.009623797025371828,0.010498687664041995,0.006124234470691163,0.0026246719160104987,0.019247594050743656,0.2152230971128609,0.006124234470691163,0.003499562554680665,0.04199475065616798,0.08661417322834646,0.05336832895888014,0.04636920384951881,0.04111986001749781,0.0542432195975503,0.14610673665791776,0.09448818897637795,0.017497812773403325,0,0.048993875765529306,0.13910761154855644,0.0017497812773403325,0.03062117235345582,0.0008748906386701663,0.0017497812773403325,0.015748031496062992,0,0,0.023622047244094488,0.11811023622047244,0.06824146981627296,0,0.007874015748031496,0.008748906386701663,0.0594925634295713,0.12073490813648294,0.12598425196850394,0.0008748906386701663,0.026246719160104987,0.003499562554680665,47.3,2,40.3,0,13,9,19,12,16.055,31,11,74.225,32,0,47.3,8.73,199.18500000000003,48.730000000000004,80.6,324.51500000000004,199.18500000000003,,0.5548560750648169,0.05006592189696456,0.5150335354585895,0,0.2551654720584321,0.1917041849140434,0.3336416186454036,0.24025307335204216,0.29730197620323956,0.4496185586276349,0.22473135037318126,0.6617050633448487,0.45748707092465785,0,0.2873383406779233,0.18702868481395624,0.14640411902845615,0.035817319176929326,0.059242272227796086,0.23852364729532569,0.8154777968896264,0.7614763527046743,107
358,"LONDON  —   “Get on with it. ” With those words late in a major speech on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May charted Britain’s course toward a clean break with the European Union and expressed her fondest hope: that the time for “division and discord” is over. Her   speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex,   negotiation, and it defined the broad objectives, but not the details, of British withdrawal. “The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do,” she said. With the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain’s relations with its neighbors for decades to come. She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people  —   as well as goods, capital and services  —   a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate. “Let me be clear,” Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. “What I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market. ” She said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, “cliff edge” breakup that she and Britain’s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid. Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs. “We seek a new and equal partnership  —   between an independent,   global Britain and our friends and allies in the E. U.,” Mrs. May said. “Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out. ” And she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed. The reaction among her opponents in the “remain” camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process. “Theresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,” said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. “She claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn’t. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy. ” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the Tories of turning Britain into “a   tax haven,” with their recent threat to slash corporate taxes if a good deal cannot be reached with the European Union. The speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell. Supporters of a withdrawal have been encouraged as well by reports that other countries in the bloc have recognized that they might suffer if there was a complete rupture and they were denied access to London’s financial services sector. But British businesses remained nervous. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that “ruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a   trading relationship between the U. K. and the E. U. ” Kallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that “as we do not expect the E. U. to compromise its principles, the U. K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit. ” Few analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain’s financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave. Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as “precisely the cherry picking that they have warned against. ” He added: “The objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted. ” But he warned that “every one of the aspirations expressed by the U. K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially. ” In Europe, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Twitter: “Sad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. ” Germany’s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, welcomed Mrs. May’s “desire for a positive and constructive partnership, a friendship with a strong E. U.,” which Germany would reciprocate. Mrs. May’s speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership. The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice. The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual   deals with   nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much   trade as possible with European Union countries. Ideally, Britain would like to have its cake and eat it, in the memorable phrase of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. In other words, Britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc, like freedom of movement, but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives. While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend. In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which “the U. K. maintains a good level of access to the E. U.’s goods markets and limited access to the   services markets. ” “Crucially, we expect the U. K. to lose its E. U. financial services passport,” Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. “This follows from the U. K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E. U. ” Many European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. ”",0,1241,17.23611111111111,72,0.36019339242546333,0,0,0.0008058017727639,0,96.03412526232833,3.8728754726337318,72.44311039484286,46.5624496373892,0.8001611603545528,0.0136986301369863,0.0531829170024174,0.010475423045930701,0.041901692183722805,0.0410958904109589,0.18372280419016923,0.0008058017727639,0.0032232070910556,0.008058017727639,0.10394842868654311,0.0056406124093473006,0.06607574536663981,0.0064464141821112,0.0016116035455278,0.012087026591458501,0.0128928283642224,0.11200644641418211,0.0024174053182917004,0.062046736502820304,0.0257856567284448,0.05076551168412571,0,0,0.0265914585012087,0.021756647864625302,0.11442385173247381,0,0,0.004834810636583401,0.0249798549556809,0,0.0265914585012087,0.035455278001611606,0.0064464141821112,0.0064464141821112,0.4665592264302981,0.0016116035455278,0.0136986301369863,0.0032232070910556,0.0024174053182917004,0.04754230459307011,0.018533440773569703,0.0032232070910556,0.017727639000805803,0.009669621273166801,0.0024174053182917004,0.0056406124093473006,0.028203062046736505,0.0128928283642224,0.007252215954875101,0.014504431909750202,0.016116035455278,0.0016116035455278,0.009669621273166801,0.19580983078162773,0.0040290088638195,0,0.024174053182917002,0.07010475423045931,0.07332796132151491,0.041901692183722805,0.0257856567284448,0.043513295729250605,0.1563255439161966,0.0894439967767929,0.023368251410153102,0,0.037066881547139406,0.09750201450443191,0.0024174053182917004,0.016116035455278,0.008863819500402902,0.0056406124093473006,0.004834810636583401,0,0,0.018533440773569703,0.08058017727639001,0.055600322320709106,0,0.032232070910556,0.0056406124093473006,0.028203062046736505,0.1095890410958904,0.11442385173247381,0.004834810636583401,0.062046736502820304,0.010475423045930701,32.75,0,60,9,15,0,53,18,6.105,55.1,40.2,4,38,0,32.75,0,120.05499999999999,53,158.1,328.88,120.05499999999999,,0.4632423757677784,0,0.6125741132772069,0.1917041849140434,0.28330039409901914,0,0.5827548635010305,0.32173116003258956,0.13858517208139617,0.5921717352000724,0.5144129557758113,0.09535767393825997,0.5003467408047562,0,0.6164895891086131,0,0.08173234028647676,0.036081912749850224,0.10763302652360981,0.22389848047491964,-0.5864100011987484,0.7761015195250803,101
359,"Since he was a boy he has hated black men. A bitter hatred of black men that boiled in his mind and consumed him. Then last week, apparently, he decided to kill them. This was the   investigators say they gathered of James Harris Jackson, a morose and seemingly directionless    white man who lived in Baltimore and had been having trouble getting rooted since leaving the Army. He had registered few obvious traces of who he was and what he stood for. Those who intersected with him found him to be a disagreeable and solitary figure who waved away contact with others. By all accounts, Timothy Caughman, 66, was a benevolent man content with an unassuming life. He lived in a former single room occupancy residence that had been his longtime home. The son of a home health care aide and a pastor, he had worked in antipoverty programs in Queens. Religion and philosophy were constants in his conversations over unhurried meals of turkey bacon and grits at local diners. In recent years, he had caught the familiar New York infatuation with celebrities and delighted in collecting their autographs and pictures. On St. Patrick’s Day, Mr. Jackson boarded a bus in Washington and rode it to New York. There were black men everywhere, and he told investigators he contemplated going elsewhere, but settled on New York because of the flood of media there. His goal was to draw the widest possible attention to his murderous plan. He made his statement of what hate looks like late on Monday night when the authorities said he pulled out a sword and fatally stabbed Mr. Caughman. He had been scavenging for cans in Midtown Manhattan around the corner from his home. Presumably, Mr. Jackson had little intention of getting away with it. Just after midnight on Wednesday, he surrendered to the police and took responsibility for the murder. He was arraigned on Thursday in Supreme Court in Manhattan and charged with   murder as a hate crime. He was ordered held without bail. The attack comes at a particularly anxious moment in America as hate crimes are on the rise in the country and especially in New York City. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo forcefully condemned the killing. At the arraignment, Joan Illuzzi, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Jackson was particularly offended by black men who were with white women. She told the judge that additional charges may be filed, including murder in the first degree, “as this is an act, most likely, of terrorism. ” Dressed in a Tyvek suit, handcuffed and his legs in shackles, Mr. Jackson sneered several times as the charges were read. At one point, he gazed at the ceiling as though bored. He did not enter a plea. Sam Talkin, Mr. Jackson’s defense lawyer, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. “We just need for the dust to settle,” he said. If the information put forth by the authorities is accurate, he added, they will have to deal with Mr. Jackson’s “obvious psychological issues. ” The investigation into Mr. Jackson is still in its early stages and much remains unknown. But pieces of his life  —   and of the man he is accused of killing  —   were beginning to come together. Thus far, investigators have not linked Mr. Jackson to any white supremacy or hate group. Their sense is that he’s a discontent, not unlike many others who carry out senseless killings. But he was blunt about his prejudices when questioned by detectives. According to a law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the investigation is continuing, “He told the cops, ‘I’ve hated black men since I was a kid. I’ve had these feelings since I was a young person. I hate black men. ’” Mr. Jackson told detectives, according to the official, that his intention was to keep on killing, the first attack being a springboard. At one point during his interrogation, he said he thought about grabbing a police officer’s gun and using it to shoot others. Investigators have not yet determined the origins of this hate. Mr. Jackson told them that he had written his beliefs down and was going to deliver his writings to The New York Times. “He said, ‘Listen, I wrote this all down, it’s in my laptop,’” the law enforcement official said. He apparently grew up in Baltimore. In 2007, he graduated from the Friends School of Baltimore, a small and prestigious Quaker day school. Matt Micciche, the head of school, said the campus community was “shocked and saddened by the news of this horrific attack. ” “Our school  —   and the Religious Society of Friends  —   has a long history of commitment to diversity, racial equality, social justice and nonviolence,” Mr. Micciche said in a statement. “The entire Friends School community extends our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Timothy Caughman. ” In March 2009, Mr. Jackson joined the Army and served at various locations in the United States, working in military intelligence. He was deployed to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011. Afterward, he was stationed in Baumholder, Germany, before being discharged in August 2012, when his rank was specialist. During his service, the Army said, he received several awards. It’s unclear what he did after leaving the Army, though he seemed lost. In the spring of 2015, he was nearly evicted from an apartment building in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood for falling behind on his rent, according to Marcus Dagan, who was filling in then as the building’s manager. Speaking by phone from Omaha, where he now lives, Mr. Dagan said Mr. Jackson occupied a   apartment and was at least six months in arrears. Mr. Dagan described him as a “slob” and a “deadbeat,” who refused to let anyone inside his apartment and never engaged in the building’s social atmosphere. “He turned into the tenant from hell,” Mr. Dagan said. He began eviction proceedings, but Mr. Jackson left before they were completed. The apartment, Mr. Dagan said, was the most disgusting thing the person hired to clean it had ever seen. “He definitely had some issues of some kind,” Mr. Dagan said. “How do you describe it? He was off. ” Yet he said he had never heard Mr. Jackson say anything that could be construed as racist. “Never had an intimation of that,” he said. “When you shake hands with somebody you can guess the character,” he said. “In his case, you’d get like three fingers and a cold fish. ” Mr. Jackson’s most recent address was a   house wedged into a narrow street lined with rowhouses in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore, just west of Johns Hopkins University, a historic area that is filled with restaurants and shops. No one answered the door at the home on Thursday. A patrol car from the Baltimore Police Department was posted outside. Members of Mr. Jackson’s family appeared to be together in his parents’ home in a gated community several miles away. On Thursday afternoon, his family issued a brief statement through a lawyer: “Our family is shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy. We extend our prayers and condolences to the family of Timothy Caughman. We have no further comments at this time and ask that our privacy be respected. ” After Mr. Jackson got to New York last Friday, he checked into the Hotel at Times Square on West 46th Street, using an assumed name. As far as the police know, he attacked no one else during those first days. As best they can tell, he was hunting. His weapon was a sword, and he carried two smaller knives. From surveillance cameras, investigators managed to track some of his movements, though there are gaps. In one video, he can be seen tailing a black man. When detectives questioned Mr. Jackson, they said he acknowledged zeroing in on that man but didn’t strike because there were too many people around. Late Monday evening, he found a target on a Midtown street corner. Timothy Caughman was bent over some garbage. Like many New Yorkers living spare lives in their retirement years, Mr. Caughman was once someone else, his identity not defined by empty pockets and a modest address. He was born in Jamaica, Queens, and grew up in a comfortable apartment in the South Jamaica Houses. One of his cousins said the family has roots in Georgia dating back to the 1700s when their ancestors were first brought to America as slaves. He was the son of Tula Caughman, a home health care aide for wealthy residents of nearby Jamaica Estates, and William Caughman, the pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church. Growing up, he was called Hard Rock, for he knew his way around a boxing ring  —   and a street fight. “He was known in the community as not to be someone who started a fight, but if you started it, he finished it,” said one of his cousins. According to Seth Peek, another cousin, Mr. Caughman earned an associate degree after attending college in Brooklyn and Staten Island. For several years in Queens, Mr. Caughman ran a division of the Neighborhood Youth Corps, a federal antipoverty program designed to provide   jobs to poor youths. “He probably gave out about two or three thousand jobs to people in the community,” said one of his cousins. He also freely contributed homespun advice on how to excel: “‘If you know that someone is going to be somewhere, and you want to meet them, you got to be there an hour early,’” the cousin recalled Mr. Caughman instructing him. Later, he held a succession of jobs, including as a concert promoter. He was particularly proud of booking an early gig by Earth Wind  Fire, before they attained fame, his cousin said. For the last 20 years, he lived in a room at the Barbour Hotel on West 36th Street that now houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. Svein Jorgensen, the chief executive of Praxis Housing Initiatives, which manages the Barbour, said that of the   residents, Mr. Caughman was one of the few who were actually permanent tenants and not part of the transient program. In reports of the murder, Mr. Caughman was incorrectly assumed to be homeless. “He was an extremely gracious individual and respectful of his neighbors,” Mr. Jorgensen said. He read avidly, and mainly kept to himself. He was a recycler of redeemables, his currency for his modest wants. His relatives said he viewed this as an entrepreneurial undertaking, a way to keep active and help pay for his room. He did maintain a social media presence. He had a Twitter account, and in his profile he defined himself as a can and bottle recycler, autograph collector and a good businessman. He said he aspired to visit California. On his Twitter feed, sandwiched between posts about celebrity culture, are links to articles about preventing cholesterol in babies and others about autism, echoing his broad interests. Among those aware of his fandom is Shari Headley, an actress who most recently played a district attorney on Tyler Perry’s “The Haves and the  ” television soap opera. She held a live chat on Twitter every Tuesday, and she said Mr. Caughman rarely missed one. One day he requested a photo of her, and she mailed him an autographed photo. “What kind of world are we living in right now?” she said, overcome with emotion. “What a harmless guy. He spends his days just wanting to take pictures with celebrities. ” When Ms. Headley’s character on “The Haves and the  ” was killed off recently, she said Mr. Caughman was downcast, wishing it weren’t true. When her agent told her Mr. Caughman had been stabbed, she hoped the same thing. Late Monday evening, as Mr. Caughman rooted through trash on Ninth Avenue, near his home, a white man in a dark coat approached him from behind. He said nothing. The man withdrew a sword from beneath his coat. A woman heard commotion, but didn’t realize what was actually happening and she ran off. But she told detectives she heard Mr. Caughman say, “Why are you doing this? What are you doing?”",0,2047,16.642276422764226,123,0.3180263800683928,0,0,0,0,87.29606150506821,7.964691257789369,94.47177441241926,11.76208147006877,0.8446507083536883,0.011235955056179775,0.043478260869565216,0.030288226673180263,0.038104543234000976,0.027357107962872496,0.18710307767464582,0.015144113336590131,0.0014655593551538837,0.01172447484123107,0.07767464582315584,0,0.06204201270151441,0.01172447484123107,0.0019540791402051783,0.01074743527112848,0.012212994626282364,0.07425500732779677,0.0009770395701025891,0.06643869076697606,0.022960429897410845,0.05129457743038593,0,0.005862237420615535,0.017586712261846604,0.004885197850512946,0.09379579872984856,0,0.008304836345872008,0.003419638495359062,0.009281875915974597,0,0.00537371763556424,0.08549096238397655,0.00537371763556424,0.00537371763556424,0.4738641914997557,0.006350757205666829,0.02051783097215437,0.019540791402051783,0.003419638495359062,0.03517342452369321,0.0019540791402051783,0.0029311187103077674,0.01612115290669272,0.015632633121641426,0.012701514411333659,0.08793356130923302,0.009281875915974597,0.015632633121641426,0.008793356130923302,0.023937469467513434,0.0014655593551538837,0,0.016609672691744015,0.2252076209086468,0.002442598925256473,0,0.0361504640937958,0.07669760625305325,0.07425500732779677,0.08695652173913043,0.013190034196384953,0.05129457743038593,0.14753297508549096,0.12261846604787494,0.01612115290669272,0.0019540791402051783,0.0268685881778212,0.1612115290669272,0.004885197850512946,0.0073277967757694185,0.0014655593551538837,0.002442598925256473,0.011235955056179775,0,0,0.06790425012212994,0.180752320468979,0.0893991206643869,0.0004885197850512946,0.020029311187103077,0.006350757205666829,0.05813385442110405,0.13190034196384953,0.13727405959941377,0.004396678065461651,0.03126526624328285,0.004885197850512946,51.625,0,250.375,11,27.575,6,28,131.45,11.675,138,35.25,18.675,72,0,51.625,20,176.175,64,476.825,703,176.175,,0.5100105963063583,0,0.8346573755928414,0.18152298323045693,0.3573122943896706,0.10791679967957667,0.3608322422287419,0.726048997877998,0.1905394912567447,0.7356140004983261,0.41544690732530537,0.27353264282468587,0.5921131170780006,0,0.5921131170780006,0.2873629812674658,0.06807380216383307,0.02472952086553323,0.18424459041731067,0.27163833075734156,-0.8955343315994057,0.7283616692426584,162
360,"WASHINGTON  —   Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who was forced out of the job in February, failed to list payments from   entities on the first of two financial disclosure forms released Saturday by the Trump administration. The first form, which he signed in February, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any nongovernment compensation that exceeds $5, 000 “in a year. ” That list appears to include all of the work that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The   payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45, 000 speaking fee from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a   news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Mr. Flynn attended the network’s lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Flynn has faced fierce criticism for the Moscow speech and for his lobbying efforts for Turkey. But the work paid well, and the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1. 5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago. What Mr. Flynn, who spent most of his adult life earning a military officer’s salary, does not appear to possess is the kind of   investment portfolio enjoyed by most wealthy Americans, including the numerous millionaires and billionaires in the Trump administration. His form listed assets valued at $380, 000 and $800, 000, most of which is tied up in retirement funds. Mr. Flynn reported an income of $1. 37 million to $1. 47 million. The bulk  —   $827, 055  —   came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The rest included speaking fees and income earned for doing consulting work and sitting on corporate boards, such as that of Adobe Systems, which paid him $125, 250. The speaking fees, all of which were from 2016, ranged from about $10, 000 to about $22, 000. He gave talks to relatively     groups like the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce in Nebraska, but also to the David Horowitz Freedom Center in California, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an   hate group. It is unlikely that Mr. Flynn, who is seeking immunity from congressional and federal investigations into Russia’s meddling in the election, will match the same income this year. He shuttered the Flynn Intel Group at the end of 2016, and then was forced out of the White House in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December. The payments for lobbying work that Mr. Flynn did for the Turkish government  —   and did not disclose until March  —   were handled through the Flynn Intel Group, and are not listed separately on the disclosure forms. Mr. Flynn did not work directly for the Turkish government the firm that hired him, Inovo, is owned by a   businessman with links to leaders in Ankara and asked him to work on an issue important to the government.",0,584,23.36,25,0.3099315068493151,0,0,0,0,99,11.19432736213558,72.54383561643836,41.233930453108535,0.8287671232876712,0.023972602739726026,0.03424657534246575,0.015410958904109588,0.02226027397260274,0.008561643835616438,0.1643835616438356,0.003424657534246575,0,0.005136986301369863,0.1113013698630137,0.0017123287671232876,0.04280821917808219,0.00684931506849315,0.0017123287671232876,0.011986301369863013,0.00684931506849315,0.0702054794520548,0,0.07191780821917808,0.0273972602739726,0.0410958904109589,0,0,0.02054794520547945,0,0.09075342465753425,0,0,0,0,0,0.003424657534246575,0.05650684931506849,0,0,0.4417808219178082,0.003424657534246575,0.011986301369863013,0.0017123287671232876,0,0.03767123287671233,0.005136986301369863,0.0017123287671232876,0.015410958904109588,0.017123287671232876,0,0.03595890410958904,0.053082191780821915,0.008561643835616438,0.011986301369863013,0.00684931506849315,0.0017123287671232876,0.003424657534246575,0.06506849315068493,0.22602739726027396,0.0273972602739726,0,0.02054794520547945,0.05650684931506849,0.1113013698630137,0.02054794520547945,0.015410958904109588,0.05821917808219178,0.1815068493150685,0.05821917808219178,0.025684931506849314,0,0.003424657534246575,0.12157534246575342,0,0.003424657534246575,0.005136986301369863,0.0017123287671232876,0.008561643835616438,0,0,0.02054794520547945,0.09246575342465753,0.07534246575342465,0,0.017123287671232876,0,0.03767123287671233,0.09931506849315068,0.08904109589041095,0,0.08732876712328767,0,14.375,0,27,1,0,0,5.025,15,1.83,0,12,12.353125,8.375,0,14.375,0,42.388125,5.025,47,89.388125,42.388125,,0.39130894237007,0,0.5469940876640034,0.042806973496989774,0,0,0.1834900590851003,0.40149162409079436,0.07564896964538316,0,0.34923639691004144,0.35585626755892674,0.27248461922136136,0,0.3676399911630594,0,0.06507353047002508,0.007714294760900041,0.07215360273876655,0.13722713320879162,-0.22581479424054066,0.8627728667912083,22
361,"Society US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23-year-old, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. “Justice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent,” Smith said. “He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him,’” Smith said. “He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him,” she stated, according to the journal. In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as “preposterous”, saying that the incident “never happened."" Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd comments about women. A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. Trump has called the allegations “slander and libel” and part of a “concerted, coordinated and vicious attack” by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss' dinner party when she was 23. ""That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,"" Smith, now 41, told the journal. ""Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don't want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,” she stated.

362,"A federal judge threw out a convicted D. C. sniper’s four life sentences Friday because he was 17 when he was originally sentenced. [U. S. District Judge Raymond Jackson in Norfolk, Virginia, ruled that Lee Boyd Malvo has a right to be   in new sentencing hearings due to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that made it unconstitutional for juveniles to receive mandatory life sentences in prison without parole, the Daily Mail reported.  Malvo, now 32, was arrested in 2002 for his role in several shootings in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia that left ten dead and injured three. The attacks were widely covered in U. S. and international media over concerns that the sniper attacks, which were carried out from a modified car trunk, were acts of terrorism. Malvo entered a guilty plea in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and agreed to two sentences of life in prison without parole. A judge in Fairfax County, Virginia, also sentenced him to two additional life terms in Fairfax County. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for courts to issue mandatory life sentences without parole to juvenile offenders. The Supreme Court further ruled in 2016 that the 2012 ruling could be applied retroactively to all sentences before the 2012 ruling. Jackson, as a result of these two rulings, threw out the four life sentences and ordered that Malvo be   in the counties of Fairfax and Spotsylvania. The Virginia attorney general, however, can appeal Jackson’s ruling, according to Fairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh, who prosecuted Malvo in 2003. The Virginia Attorney General’s Office is “reviewing the decision and will do everything possible, including a possible appeal, to make sure this convicted mass murderer serves the life sentences that were originally imposed,” Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, said Friday. Kelly added that Malvo could still be   to life in prison based on the convictions even if he is granted a new sentencing hearing. Defense lawyers for Malvo, however, have argued that he was an adolescent who did not know any better and was influenced by his older accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, USA Today reported. They remain hopeful that these new court hearings might give him a shot at parole. The Washington Post reported that Jackson’s ruling does not apply to Malvo’s six life sentences in Maryland that he received after pleading guilty to six counts of murder there, but Malvo’s Maryland lawyers are trying to appeal his convictions based on the Supreme Court rulings at the state and county levels. A hearing is set for June in that state.",0,438,19.90909090909091,22,0.3721461187214612,0,0,0,0,92.82834908997363,13.50565812983919,61.68475588338602,18.99160804640257,0.7168949771689498,0.0045662100456621,0.03881278538812785,0.0228310502283105,0.0410958904109589,0.00228310502283105,0.13926940639269406,0.0136986301369863,0.00684931506849315,0.0136986301369863,0.0730593607305936,0,0.0639269406392694,0.03881278538812785,0.00228310502283105,0.01598173515981735,0.00684931506849315,0.06621004566210045,0,0.0684931506849315,0.0136986301369863,0.03881278538812785,0,0.00684931506849315,0.02054794520547945,0.0091324200913242,0.0547945205479452,0,0,0,0,0,0.00684931506849315,0.045662100456621,0.00228310502283105,0.00228310502283105,0.410958904109589,0.0228310502283105,0.0091324200913242,0,0,0.0502283105022831,0.0045662100456621,0,0.0045662100456621,0.0091324200913242,0,0.0228310502283105,0,0.01598173515981735,0.01141552511415525,0.0228310502283105,0.0045662100456621,0,0.0410958904109589,0.1917808219178082,0.00228310502283105,0,0.0091324200913242,0.0502283105022831,0.02511415525114155,0.02968036529680365,0.0182648401826484,0.04337899543378995,0.13926940639269406,0.07990867579908675,0.0091324200913242,0,0.0045662100456621,0.1506849315068493,0.00228310502283105,0.0045662100456621,0.00228310502283105,0,0,0,0.01598173515981735,0.0228310502283105,0.05707762557077625,0.09360730593607305,0,0.01598173515981735,0.00228310502283105,0.04337899543378995,0.09360730593607305,0.09360730593607305,0,0.01598173515981735,0.0045662100456621,1,0,57,0,3,0,5,6,0,57,0,0,0,6,1,0,4,5,108,116,4,,0.045503819962193694,0,0.7309924930886533,0,0.12512420160141322,0,0.19248405980003652,0.22241846975351037,0,0.7309924930886533,0,0,0,0.22241846975351037,0.5230104476598908,0,0.0076045627376425855,0.009505703422053232,0.20532319391634982,0.22053231939163498,-0.8751822116538412,0.779467680608365,28
363,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1.   Donald Trump filled some top national security posts last week, naming loyalists who reflect his campaign’s   views. His choice for attorney general is Senator Jeff Sessions, above, who was blocked from becoming a federal judge in 1986 because of accusations of racially charged remarks. Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who sees Islamic militancy as an existential threat, will be national security adviser. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas was nominated to be the director of the C. I. A. Here’s our latest coverage of Mr. Trump’s transition to the White House. ____ 2. “Build something  . Something Americans can be proud of. ” That’s our   columnist, urging Mr. Trump to follow a lofty vision for his pledged upgrade of the country’s aging infrastructure. We even have a list of 10 projects, balanced between red and blue states, where he could leave his mark while helping unify a bitterly divided America. ____ 3. In the days after the election, our reporters and photographers fanned out across the country as a new political reality set in. They returned with a portrait of a country at odds with itself. We’re also beginning a podcast of  conversations among siblings,   classmates and friends who voted for different candidates. “I could never believe you’re a racist, man, that’s silly, that’s stupid,” said one young black man to a friend of Hispanic heritage who supported Mr. Trump. “Can’t believe you’re sexist. Cannot. But part of me is puzzled. ” Here are 19 questions to ask loved ones who voted differently. ____ 4. President Obama will return to the United States on Monday after the last major foreign trip of his presidency, with stops in Greece, Germany and Peru. On Tuesday, he’ll give the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom to 21 recipients, including Kareem   Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Hanks and Bill and Melinda Gates. And on Wednesday he’ll pardon a turkey for the last time as president. ____ 5. Seventeen new cardinals received their “red hats” at a ceremony Saturday, officially joining the Roman Catholic Church’s College of Cardinals. Who Pope Francis selects for the college is critical to his efforts to reshape the church, as the group will eventually elect Francis’ successor. Three Americans are among the new additions, the most Francis named from any one country. And while U. S. politics is never a determining factor in who is selected, all three men have been outspoken opponents of Republican Party positions. ____ 6. In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began six years ago, the voices of torture victims and their loved ones are being heard. The   public hearings are an effort to salve the wounds from nearly 60 years of dictatorship. Mothers demanded justice for sons who were shot to death during the protests that ushered in democracy, and former prisoners described being tortured, humiliated and even forced to engage in homosexual acts. ____ 7. The skyline of New York City has changed drastically over the past decade. We’ve gathered a number of notable new buildings that you may recognize (like 1 World Trade Center) or may not (um, a salt shed? ). Think you know the city’s recent additions pretty well? Here’s a quiz to test your knowledge. It includes the hyperbolic paraboloid, or   pyramid, above. ____ 8. Scientists who drilled into what is considered ground zero of the dinosaur extinction found something that surprised them: granite. The drilling happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where some 66 million years ago an asteroid crashed into Earth with the energy of 100 million atomic bombs. It left behind a    scar known as the Chicxulub crater, shown in an artist’s rendering above. Their finding suggests that powerful impacts can catapult materials buried deep in a planet’s crust much closer to its surface. ____ 9. After  Thursday’s Thanksgiving turkey, people across America will head to big box stores and camp out in preparation for “doorbuster” deals to kick off Black Friday shopping. Ah, the holiday season. But whatever your shopping strategy is, there are some innovative ways to save a buck. Like triggering retailers to email you coupons by filling up a virtual shopping cart, then fully logging out of the site. Here are some other tips, and a guide to not overpaying on Black Friday. ____ 10. Finally, a story about Thanksgiving. Specifically, the story of a    homesick college student who made a traditional dinner for the first time in an icy cold dorm. The guests were five other kids who couldn’t get home. That was in 1981. “I wish I could remember if we had the sense to be grateful then, for the food, for the comfort of one another, for the luxury of our education,” she wrote recently. We hope you have a happy holiday with much to be grateful for. ____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.

365,"Taming the corporate media beast The Crisis of the European Union Is Irreversible The political-economic block and its common currency cannot be salvaged Donate! The author is an Italian industrialist and honorary member of the Academy of Science of the Institut de France According to a well-known Italian Research Centre, from 2003 to 2014 the European single currency cost an 11% GDP reduction throughout the Eurozone and 18 million additional unemployed people. Conversely, as a result of the Maastricht agreement only, throughout the Eurozone we have lost 8 million jobs and an additional 5% of Gross Domestic Product, owing to the obligation to eliminate deficit and cut investment. Furthermore, the report of said Research Centre shows that, again in late 2014, the average EU unemployment rate was approximately 11.6%. In a scenario of parity with the dollar, the EU unemployment in the Eurozone would have been 5.8%, more or less the same as the US rate in that phase. Hence a monetary policy characterized by an excessive overvaluation of the European currency blocked both exports and the internal market at the same time. Furthermore, it created the conditions for a deterioration of public budgets in terms of deficit and debt. In fact, again at the end of 2014, the Eurozone recorded a public deficit totalling 269 billions which, without the single currency, would even be turned into a surplus of 165 billion euro, with a difference equal to 445 billions. In terms of GDP percentage, the difference would be 4.1 points while, with specific reference to the Eurozone’s public debt, we would have had three trillion euro less. Only for Italy, as many as 400 billion public debt less. Working on this assumption, all current evils would have been avoided if there had not been the overvaluation of the euro against the dollar. There would have not been the massive impact of the financial crisis coming from the United States, at first with Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 and later with the recurrent banking crises in Europe, which put a strain on the public finances of major European governments. Considering that all EU governments were accustomed to borrow huge sums directly from the banking system, we can imagine the effects of the financial and credit crisis on the various European countries’ budgets. It is worth recalling that the United States have never liked the euro – quite the reverse they have always considered it ""imaginative and useless"", as former President George Bush I stated in recently-published public papers. Reading between the lines of its official documents, the EU itself maintains that the financial crisis came from the United States and that it made serious mistakes. Also according to the EU official documents, the mistakes were allegedly the following: 1) too much attention focused on the public budget deficit on an yearly basis, without being too much worried about the public debt as a whole. According to European standards, the EU government submitted reduced annual budgets for obtaining EU funding - later obviously the public debt increased anyway and real trouble came. Also thanks to the EU operating logic, the naive myth that the crisis was not structural and could be managed with some cosmetic measures has led to the current decline. Said decline has been triggered off by the rapid growth of interest rates on the EU Southern countries’ public debt. 2) Again according to the EU papers, there has also been a lack of surveillance over competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances. This is not great news. However, there is always someone who benefits from the economic disharmonies – just to use the old terminology of the remarkable Italian philosopher Mario Calderoni - while others stand to lose as a result of them. There has never been a solidarity-based Europe during crises, but only in ""good times"". Therefore, in the losing countries, we recorded growing indebtedness of the private sector, not controlled owing to the myth of companies’ autonomy - and hence an increasing weakening of banks. The other EU ""winning"" countries took over the losers’ market shares. Again, instead of imposing draconian penalties which worsen the economic problems, we should have supported the weakest economies and the most unbalanced ones in terms of trade with the United States. The United States exported their mass of bad loans, disguised as new securities, to the European Union, the financial enemy that had dreamt of relegating the dollar to the rank of a Euro ancillary currency. There was also this geopolitical war within the crisis of the European currency. Moreover, the European Central Bank aimed at maintaining financial stability but, by statute, it could not buy public debt from other non-EU countries, as all issuing banks do. This is the main way in which central banks can nip in the bud speculative attempts against them. Furthermore, in Italy, as in other South Europe’s economies, foreign competition has kept wages at very low levels and, in dealing with competition for exports, our political and economic structure has only reduced the labour incomes almost to the level of the worst competitor. 3) Another EU public self-criticism is relating to the slow decision-making mechanism: the European establishment has interpreted the small shocks of the global crisis as isolated phenomena and not as a common geoeconomic problem. Hence the slow pace and often the ineffectiveness of the EU ""solutions"". And this faced with a ""market"" - if we may call it so - of investors who, as soon as they saw the crisis in the South, played a downward game or went away quickly. Good old days when the Treasury rightly bought the unsold debt securities at the Bank of Italy’s auctions. And, it is worth noting that, in so doing, it did not create inflation at all. Currently, however, markets are fast like jackals, which smell corpses, while States have been slow as marmots. This is the real problem of today’s politicians. States must increase their pace and be very quick and capable of understanding both adverse media and the political and military operations which are objectively dangerous for them. Moreover considering that, at the time, the public debt securities were held mostly by banks, their default was possible and easy to take place. Today there is a new crisis looming large on Europe, namely the crisis of non-performing loans: in Portugal, Italy and Spain, but also in some North European countries, the non-performing loans are worth over 540 billion euro. Hence shortly another European debt crisis will materialize. 4) Currently the European Union is basically a Gaullist-style ""Europe of States""– even though it strongly denies so. Hence the idea of ​creating the ""United States of Europe"" is extraordinary nonsense: the EU Member States are so different from one another, and with such a diversified economy, that these ""United States of Europe"" would create more contrasts internally than externally, namely with the United States of America, Russia and China. Not to mention that, with a view to becoming today’s USA, America had to undergo a wide civil war, whose echoes are not completely over even today. 5) Moreover, the united Europe - and I am talking about the Euro zone - will be increasingly entangled in an area of ​​structural deflation which condemns 'Italy, together with other less economically strong countries, to face an indefinite period of very low growth rates. On the contrary, the other North European countries will continue to grow and, above all, will not have to tackle the same problems we have, namely low wages and exports facing fierce competition, not protected by the Euro. 6) Hence what can be done? We must prepare for a slow but safe exit from the Euro, not waiting for the EU ""bureaucratic Caesarism"", as well as redefining and protecting our export area. Then we must use our credit instruments and debt securities as alternative currency, where possible – as well as use some well-disguised protectionism also vis-à-vis the EU itself. Finally, we must rethink our overall strategy, which we have never done. The economic crises are always geopolitical crises. Furthermore we must fund the companies’ technological upgrade projects with State funds, without waiting for the EU claims. Last but not least, we must put an end to young people’s ""brain drain"". It is true that, as some liberal-masochists maintain, the current professions’ market is global, but it is also true that the cost of their education and training has been borne by our State and our families.

366,"Corbett • 11/12/2016 • 20 Comments The voting machines have decided who will be the next puppet figurehead of the Pax Americana deep state for the next four years. The circus is over and the peanut shells are being swept out of the stands. So what do we have to show for all of it? Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and some not-so-good news for you. Let’s start with the bad news. Apparently some people voted for Trump in the belief that he was some sort of anti-establishment truth-telling hero of the working class. I hate to be the one to disabuse you of this notion, so let’s just look at his transition team, his campaign team, the people who have already been tapped to be part of the new administration and the people who are being contacted for potential cabinet appointments.

368,"The CEO of Squatty Potty, Bobby Edwards, discussed his decision to pull his company’s ads featuring Kathy Griffin after the release of a photo of Griffin holding a faux bloody decapitated head of President Donald Trump. [Said Edwards, “My heart fell into my stomach,” when he saw the image. “I was totally disappointed and heartbroken and I thought this campaign   …     we have to kill it. We cannot have her with this image  …    . ”  Edwards said his product is for everyone and he doesn’t want to alienate anyone. “When you see an image like that that’s so divisive and so disturbing, you don’t have a decision, really,” added Edwards. “It was the total disrespect for the office of the presidency and decorum and the way we conduct ourselves   …     it crossed the line and was very offensive, not only to me but to people I love. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

369,"in: Special Interests , US News The new year is almost here and it’s often a time when we all start to think about what we want to change for the next year. I’ve never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change? Do a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you’ve felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not. I’ve found in my own life that if I don’t pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what’s playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn’t change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don’t move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I’m not a victim to what happens. 11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk – It’s first because it’s probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It’s not helping you. 2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! – Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months. 3. Let go of chasing ‘success’ – So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There’s no such thing as failure. (more) 4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams – So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can’t do it or because it’s unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it! 5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems – We often get into this mentality that we just need to “get over it.” In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let’s face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you. 6. Stop comparing yourself to others – This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone’s journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others. 7. Stop judging others – Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It’s like something we can’t stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) 8. Stop the blame game – Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn’t allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I’m not saying there’s no such things others can do to hurt you, I’m simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don’t even point blame, it doesn’t help us. 9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted – This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be “the weird one.” The reality is, it’s more ‘weird’ to be a version of yourself that isn’t genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It’s a choice you can’t maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don’t try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust. 10. Let go of the need to control everything – Sometimes we can’t take a step forward in anything because we don’t know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don’t worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn’t mean be reckless, just that you don’t need to control every thing, person and detail. 11.

370,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 5 Comments Last Saturday, Oct. 29, the Medford Police Patrolmen’s Association (MPPA) of Medford, Massachusetts, posted 3 photos on its Facebook page of two Medford police officers seemingly arresting a person in a Hillary Clinton mask and orange prison clothes at the Halloween Fall Festival in Haines Square, West Medford. CBS Boston reports, Oct. 30, 2016, that the caption on the photos read: “Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today…” Another photo showed three Medford police officers posing with someone in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, “Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!” By 8:15 pm that night, MPPA removed the posts from its Facebook page, with an apology in a statement from MPPA President Harry MacGilvray: “These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.” MacGilvray was one of the officers in the photos. LOL Fox25 WFXT reports that the police union removed the photos because of a flurry of negative Facebook comments from Hillary supporters, such as: Jennifer Popkin: “I can’t believe this unprofessional behavior. Police in uniform should not be espousing political beliefs, let alone the kind of irresponsible rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. Absolutely deplorable and also likely illegal under Section 23(b)(2)(ii) of the conflict of interest law.” Mike Piehl: “Trump goes on trial for fraud in November and child rape in December but YOU . . . .” Jeremy Thorpe: “This is illegal. I am screen-shotting this comment to demonstrate that you are deleting critical comments.” Katarina Dutton: “As a citizen of Medford, I am appalled by police making it clear that I, and so many others, are not welcome or safe here.” Tamar Amidon: “This is so shameful for Medford. I’m so glad I don’t live there now. I never thought of them being one of the bad apple bins.” That Popkin, Piehl, Thorpe, Dutton, Amidon, et al. are outraged by the Medford police Halloween prank but not in the least bothered by of Hillary Clinton’s criminal use of an unsecured email server, her utterly corrupt pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, and her abandoning four Americans to die in Benghazi, can only mean one thing: ~Eowyn",1,398,18.952380952380953,21,0.3693467336683417,0,0,0,0,88.31407035175879,21.821854369888666,46.984924623115575,25.774193548387096,0.7562814070351759,0.002512562814070352,0.04020100502512563,0.035175879396984924,0.05527638190954774,0.01507537688442211,0.23366834170854273,0.01256281407035176,0.002512562814070352,0.01256281407035176,0.06281407035175879,0.002512562814070352,0.04522613065326633,0.010050251256281407,0.002512562814070352,0.01256281407035176,0.01256281407035176,0.08542713567839195,0.02512562814070352,0.06532663316582915,0.010050251256281407,0.04271356783919598,0.007537688442211055,0.002512562814070352,0.022613065326633167,0.007537688442211055,0.08040201005025126,0.005025125628140704,0,0.002512562814070352,0.005025125628140704,0,0.005025125628140704,0.020100502512562814,0,0,0.4120603015075377,0.005025125628140704,0,0,0.02512562814070352,0.06030150753768844,0.007537688442211055,0,0.017587939698492462,0.002512562814070352,0.017587939698492462,0,0.005025125628140704,0.017587939698492462,0.020100502512562814,0.02763819095477387,0.005025125628140704,0,0.04020100502512563,0.17839195979899497,0.007537688442211055,0.010050251256281407,0.035175879396984924,0.06030150753768844,0.0678391959798995,0.03768844221105527,0.02763819095477387,0.05527638190954774,0.135678391959799,0.09798994974874371,0.01507537688442211,0,0.04020100502512563,0.11055276381909548,0.002512562814070352,0.002512562814070352,0.005025125628140704,0.005025125628140704,0.032663316582914576,0,0.002512562814070352,0.005025125628140704,0.05527638190954774,0.06532663316582915,0,0.022613065326633167,0.002512562814070352,0.02763819095477387,0.07788944723618091,0.08542713567839195,0,0.04271356783919598,0.005025125628140704,9.29,12.280000000000001,67.1,1,0,6,0,55.25,7.29,60.625,10.29,13.46,8.29,0,9.29,0,43.86,6,155.5,202.36,43.86,,0.31191346741607956,0.37468837782527203,0.7660350643880017,0.04652482465851837,0,0.22646721143623746,0,0.7294316622535892,0.2623821565025694,0.7473597257248963,0.334265622222398,0.3964198337368269,0.2880082114930462,0,0.5592131256644566,0,0.07841104118993135,0.01072654462242563,0.27799628146453087,0.3617705949656751,-0.8851088672777273,0.6382294050343249,41
371,"Posted on November 6, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse The leading financiers of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers, were exposed on November 4th by the great investigative journalist Lee Fang, as being solid supporters and heavy financiers of congressional candidates who have been leaders in expanding the U.S. military budget and moving America toward a police state (including militarization of the police). The leading financier of the Democratic Party, George Soros, has long been known to provide major financial backing for the most-neoconservative Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, who favor every possible military invasion and coup (and see this , for more on that). In fact, Soros was one of the top three financial backers (the other two were the U.S. government and the Netherlands government) for the television station in Ukraine that championed extermination of the people in Ukraine’s Donbass region, where the coup-imposed government, which he helped to install, is loathed . And also on the Ukrainian matter, the Kochs have championed the view that when considering whether Crimea should be part of Russia, or else part of Ukraine, or else entirely independent, the people who live there shouldn’t have any opportunity to vote on the matter, and they should instead be forced to be ‘Ukrainians’ , even if they loathe this post-coup Ukrainian governmen t. Soros and the Kochs insist that this Ukrainian government should be imposed upon Crimeans, regardless of what they want. In fact, Soros has proposed adding from 20 to 50 billion taxpayer dollars to the effort by the coup-imposed Ukrainian government’s military, in order for that government to achieve this conquest of Crimea (to restore it to Ukraine, to which it had been forcibly joined, by the Soviet dictator Khrushchev in 1954, after having been for hundreds of years a part of Russia — and to which Obama and the Kochs and Soros insist it belongs). Regarding the U.S. Presidential contest, the difference between the Kochs and Soros is that the Kochs in 2016 directed all of their political financing away from the Presidential contest altogether, so as to weaken Trump’s effort to beat Hillary, whereas Soros has devoted tens of millions of dollars to the financing of Hillary’s campaign and of PACS (such as this) that support Hillary against Trump. Hillary is supported by Kochs and the big oil-and-gas firms as well as by Soros and Wall Street. Virtually all of the U.S. aristocracy want Hillary Clinton to become President. Right after the nominating conventions, the Kochs withdrew their financial backing of the Republican ‘hawk’ U.S. Senatorial candidate Ron Johnson in Wisconsin because Johnson had just endorsed Trump . But afterwards, the Kochs — as Lee Fang noted — spent big on the campaigns of Ron Johnson and of other pro-Lockheed-Martin (etc.) Senators. To be pro ‘Defense’ industry, isn’t to be pro-U.S. defense, but instead to be pro-mega-corporate investors, and that’s something America’s entire aristocracy are, because they control all of the large U.S.-based corporations. Those corporations expand by the U.S. military having the might to enforce in foreign countries what their owners want — so that America’s State Department and USAID etc. can serve as spokespersons for, essentially, the billionaires who own controlling blocs of stock in U.S.-based international corporations. That’s “the system,” which Hillary Clinton and the Kochs and Soros and all the rest of the U.S. aristocracy support, and which Bernie Sanders opposed without understanding it. If Donald Trump understands it, he’s been keeping that fact secret from his followers, who generally understand nothing of it at all. Maybe if he were to try to explain it to them he’d be called ‘unpatriotic’ — even though his trying to explain it to them would actually be the deepest form of patriotism. Unfortunately, for him to be patriotic in that way would probably be politically suicidal for his campaign. He instead points to “foreigners” as being America’s enemies, when the real enemies are actually right at home in America — and they’re enemies of the entire world, not just their own country. These are the people at the top of the global food-chain. It’s not clear whether Trump feels mainly that he’s one of them, or instead that they’re his chief enemies. How much more ambiguous could a person be than that? And is the ambiguity intentional? The most reliable answer might be found by identifying whom his actual political enemies are — and they seem to be virtually all of the global aristocracy. Maybe they know him in ways that the U.S. public don’t and can’t. The public will just have to guess. But no guesses are necessary in order to understand Hillary Clinton. She has a lengthy record in public office, and it’s entirely consistent, as a neoconservative .",1,827,22.35135135135135,37,0.3313180169286578,0,0,0,0,82.07038104982483,3.4131739683130236,64.17618343857764,34.14214698374311,0.781136638452237,0.016928657799274487,0.03869407496977025,0.036275695284159616,0.026602176541717048,0.006045949214026602,0.18984280532043532,0.006045949214026602,0,0.02902055622732769,0.0761789600967352,0,0.08343409915356712,0.0036275695284159614,0,0.014510278113663845,0.02176541717049577,0.13059250302297462,0,0.05562273276904474,0.02539298669891173,0.07134220072551391,0.016928657799274487,0.0024183796856106408,0.037484885126964934,0.016928657799274487,0.08343409915356712,0,0.0012091898428053204,0.0024183796856106408,0.0012091898428053204,0,0.0036275695284159614,0.02418379685610641,0.0012091898428053204,0.0012091898428053204,0.49939540507859737,0.0024183796856106408,0.0012091898428053204,0.0012091898428053204,0,0.0592503022974607,0.014510278113663845,0.0012091898428053204,0.019347037484885126,0.022974607013301087,0.0036275695284159614,0.016928657799274487,0.016928657799274487,0.0036275695284159614,0.010882708585247884,0.010882708585247884,0.013301088270858524,0.0012091898428053204,0.018137847642079808,0.22128174123337363,0.008464328899637243,0.007255139056831923,0.008464328899637243,0.060459492140266025,0.06287787182587666,0.045949214026602174,0.015719467956469165,0.06529625151148731,0.14993954050785974,0.10519951632406288,0.02539298669891173,0.0024183796856106408,0.009673518742442563,0.0773881499395405,0,0.0048367593712212815,0.0024183796856106408,0,0.0036275695284159614,0,0,0.016928657799274487,0.07134220072551391,0.060459492140266025,0,0.032648125755743655,0.015719467956469165,0.009673518742442563,0.10399032648125756,0.12091898428053205,0,0.05078597339782346,0.013301088270858524,10,0,61,0,2,1,12,6,10,5.45,6,8.025,25,0,10,0,56.025,15,93.45,163.475,56.025,,0.26879595339798257,0,0.6915869164489352,0,0.06848625276486654,0.035457295016875355,0.3060994835732393,0.18070688367162685,0.26879595339798257,0.1669068644409087,0.18070688367162685,0.22780213002003422,0.4789002211893231,0,0.41122923306582276,0,0.05938154164127295,0.015898672460849517,0.09904872943109251,0.173269032035825,-0.6605144073726219,0.826730967964175,47
372,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump is broadening the field of candidates for secretary of state as his transition team remains divided nearly a month after the election over how to fill the most prominent gap in his prospective cabinet. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters on Sunday that the search had expanded beyond the four men thought to be under consideration and that Mr. Trump planned to interview additional candidates early this week. Those new candidates appeared to include John R. Bolton, an ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush Jon M. Huntsman Jr. the former Utah governor and ambassador to China under President Obama Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia. Asked about the search on the ABC program “This Week,” Vice   Mike Pence mentioned Mr. Bolton as a potential candidate and said others could be added to the list. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump for about an hour on Friday, and Mr. Tillerson is set to meet with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the meetings. Despite their differences over the Iraq war, which Mr. Bolton ardently supported, Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he turned to Mr. Bolton for military advice and called him “a tough cookie. ” The transition team had previously signaled that the group under consideration had narrowed to four men: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a close ally of Mr. Trump Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and David H. Petraeus, the retired general and director of the C. I. A. under President Obama. Some of those candidates may be brought back in for further interviews, the people briefed on the meetings said. An announcement of a selection for the post is not expected for at least several more days. In an audition of sorts, Mr. Petraeus appeared on “This Week” to highlight his foreign policy experience in the military and his work abroad in the private sector. He also sought to put behind him a potentially significant hurdle to his candidacy: his mishandling of classified material while he was a top general. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2015 and was forced to resign as C. I. A. director. “Five years ago, I made a serious mistake,” Mr. Petraeus said. “I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I paid a very heavy price for it, and I’ve learned from it. ” But he added that it was up to others to “determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not. ” The wrangling over who should be America’s top diplomat comes as Mr. Trump’s team continues to face questions about his   phone conversation with the president of Taiwan last week, which angered China and rattled other Asian nations. Mr. Bolton advocates closer ties with Taiwan as a means of putting pressure on China, arguing that Beijing’s growing power in the region should be checked. Mr. Trump’s advisers are battling, at times publicly, over whether he should choose from among his campaign loyalists or go outside that circle, a move that could alienate voters who were angry at the Republican establishment. Much of that wrangling has centered on Mr. Romney, who was among Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics during the campaign. Mr. Trump has told aides that he believes that Mr. Romney would “look the part” as the face of American outreach to the world and would make a fine secretary of state. But Ms. Conway, who has been openly critical of Mr. Romney, continued to attack him during a “Fox News Sunday” appearance, saying that the backlash to his candidacy among Mr. Trump’s core supporters had been “breathtaking. ” Asked if her criticism of him was appropriate, she said, “I would turn the question around and ask, was it appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump, and never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly. ” Ms. Conway, answering questions from reporters about the expanded search as she entered Trump Tower in New York on Sunday, said the transition team had been happily surprised by the number of wealthy businesspeople who had come forward to express interest. Mr. Trump, who was lifted to victory in the election in large part by the support of white   voters, has faced criticism over his appointment of several   people to top posts. “There are a number of people that we may not have thought wanted to leave their very lucrative private industry positions to go and serve the government,” Ms. Conway said. “It’s exciting, frankly, to at least get their counsel. ” Another person who will meet this week with Mr. Trump is James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral whose name was floated as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. It was unclear if he was being considered for a specific position. Despite the very public    over the secretary of state appointment, Mr. Trump remains well ahead of the pace set by most of his predecessors in naming members of his cabinet. In addition to meetings this week, he is scheduled to travel at least twice, to Fayetteville, N. C. and to Des Moines, on his “thank you” tour. Mr. Petraeus spoke on the ABC program from the sideline of a conference in Germany, greeting the host, George Stephanopoulos, with a “guten tag” before beginning the interview. The retired general praised Mr. Trump as “actually quite pragmatic. ” He appeared careful not to contradict Mr. Trump on a range of his foreign policy priorities, including building a border wall between the United States and Mexico, potentially working with Russia to defeat the Islamic State, and discarding the Iran nuclear accord. “In our conversation, what I enjoyed, most frankly, was the discussion of issues, or, say, campaign rhetoric, if you will, and then placing that in a strategic context,” Mr. Petraeus said. Before he appeared on the show, Mr. Petraeus seemed to get a lift from Mr. Pence, who dismissed concerns about Mr. Petraeus’s mishandling of classified material, in which he gave secret materials to a biographer with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Pence called Mr. Petraeus an “American hero” and said Mr. Trump would consider him based on “the totality” of his career. “Look, he made mistakes, and he paid the consequences for those mistakes,” Mr. Pence said.",0,1101,20.01818181818182,55,0.3369663941871026,0,0,0,0,95.80172154204337,7.915633674892224,88.63447565150562,24.330835603996366,0.7838328792007266,0.01907356948228883,0.048138056312443236,0.019981834695731154,0.03451407811080836,0.01634877384196185,0.19346049046321526,0.009990917347865577,0.0018165304268846503,0.008174386920980926,0.08537693006357856,0.0009082652134423251,0.05267938237965486,0.006357856494096276,0.0036330608537693005,0.006357856494096276,0.005449591280653951,0.07992733878292461,0.0018165304268846503,0.06085376930063579,0.025431425976385105,0.04450499545867393,0,0.0009082652134423251,0.01907356948228883,0.015440508628519528,0.11807447774750227,0,0,0.0009082652134423251,0.005449591280653951,0,0.010899182561307902,0.05994550408719346,0.0018165304268846503,0.0018165304268846503,0.4477747502270663,0,0.012715712988192553,0,0.008174386920980926,0.045413260672116255,0.0027247956403269754,0.0018165304268846503,0.018165304268846504,0.015440508628519528,0.007266121707538601,0.0681198910081744,0.008174386920980926,0.015440508628519528,0.005449591280653951,0.01725703905540418,0.0009082652134423251,0.0009082652134423251,0.007266121707538601,0.19618528610354224,0.0009082652134423251,0,0.027247956403269755,0.08719346049046321,0.05812897366030881,0.049954586739327886,0.01634877384196185,0.08537693006357856,0.16530426884650318,0.09536784741144415,0.015440508628519528,0,0.03451407811080836,0.1307901907356948,0.0009082652134423251,0.006357856494096276,0.0018165304268846503,0.0009082652134423251,0.012715712988192553,0,0.0009082652134423251,0.035422343324250684,0.14986376021798364,0.07811080835603997,0,0.027247956403269755,0.0027247956403269754,0.03996366939146231,0.11353315168029064,0.11625794732061762,0.0018165304268846503,0.045413260672116255,0.0018165304268846503,26.35,0,74.625,2,0,7,3,27.4,18.83,27.4,1,32.375,22,0,26.35,10,98.215,20,118.025,231.24,98.215,,0.4427362430961733,0,0.6923103818852767,0.0568727151524708,0,0.1742756758562112,0.08295026921233913,0.4523971840493058,0.3621415151902326,0.4523971840493058,0.029268651413606912,0.4939637409351868,0.39879456798407137,0,0.2134408548890932,0.23166247903553996,0.07719848456266114,0.015720304345092122,0.09276944601647488,0.1817581588379551,-0.45790679851482924,0.8182418411620449,60
373,"0 427 “That’s going to be you,” the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator’s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU’s national office reports they’ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families — especially those living in low-income neighborhoods — that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed “Excellence Academy.” The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family’s new set of troubles began. According to the complaints, an “Academy of Excellence” teacher named Faye Myles began “singling out” the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for “disfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.” ‘Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him — “All you Muslims think you are so smart” — in front of the entire class.’ Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. ‘I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn’t be given visas. They’ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You’re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.’ Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his “Academy of Excellence” teacher would also would tell him to “shut up” and punish him during class “downtime” when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. The bus rides home added to the child’s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher’s example and pile on the insults. ‘On the bus ride home, A.A.’s classmates took up his teacher’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a “terrorist,” and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.’ The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill “with a stomach ache” and had no desire to return to the “Academy of Excellence.” In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus’ emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. And then Brenda Nelson, an “Academy of Excellence” board member, printed out two “voluntary” withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: ‘Get your kids out of here. I don’t want them here.’ When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. ‘In spite of some teachers’ valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate’s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate’s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.’ And, sadly, it’s not just the kids. ‘A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words “Build the wall higher” last week, alluding to Trump’s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.’ And in case you assume the “Academy of Excellence” teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you’re wrong.

374,"It is all about the price. Millions of people buying insurance in the marketplaces created by the federal health care law have one feature in mind. It is not finding a favorite doctor, or even a trusted company. It is how much  —   or, more precisely, how little  —   they can pay in premiums each month. And for many of them, especially those who are healthy, all the prices are too high. The unexpected laser focus on price has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among the country’s top insurers, as fewer healthy people than expected have signed up. And that has created two vexing questions: Will the major insurance companies stay in the marketplaces? And if they do, will the public have a wide array of plans to choose from  —   a central tenet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act? “The marketplace has been and continues to be unsustainable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers. Most Americans with health insurance get it through their employers or from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The marketplaces were created under the health care law to give the millions of people not covered in those ways a way to buy health plans. While major insurers continue to make profits over all, they say that the economics of the marketplaces do not work for them. Insurers can offer marketplace plans at four different coverage tiers, and the government subsidizes the premiums for millions of people. The thinking was that enough healthy people would buy insurance to balance out the costs for the   . But things are not going exactly as envisioned. People shopping in the marketplaces are overwhelmingly choosing the cheapest plans they can find, according to a federal analysis. In 2014,   of people went for the   or    plans in each of the tiers. In 2015, about half chose the cheapest plans. The pricing pressure is playing out on multiple fronts. People with expensive medical conditions, knowing that they need reliable coverage, seem willing to pay a little more for plans offered by the large companies. Those plans tend to have a wider choice of doctors and a stronger brand name, and the insurers say the people signing up are sicker than they expected. Healthy and young people  —   who are essential to insurers to offset the costs of care for unhealthy people  —   are regularly turning to whatever plan is cheapest, including those from   insurers or with the smallest networks of hospitals and doctors. Many other young and healthy people, particularly those not eligible for generous subsidies, are shunning plans altogether, finding all of the prices too high. That decision puts them at risk of tax penalties. By some estimates, about 10 million people are signed up, fewer than half of the 21 million expected by now. All of this has the major insurance companies, as they finish their third year of selling individual policies under the law, reevaluating their role in the marketplace. The top insurers have essentially stopped talking about expanding their marketplace ambitions. Two companies, UnitedHealth Group and Humana, have said they plan to largely exit the marketplaces. Aetna has halted plans to enter more states. Even insurers that insist they are committed, like Anthem, which offers   Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states, are struggling to find their way. Mr. Swedish describes the market as “not predictable and not reliable. ” If the major insurers keep cutting back, it could lead to a cascade of effects for the people who depend on the marketplaces for coverage. People could potentially face higher premiums because there are fewer insurers competing, and they could have more limited choices of plans and doctors. The apprehension is not lost on regulators and lawmakers. On Thursday, the Obama administration said it was exploring ways to protect insurers from very expensive medical claims. And recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, President Obama wrote that more financial assistance for people may be needed. So the mainstream insurers are struggling to find a business model for the marketplaces that works. If an insurer is successful at being the cheapest in a market, it has often found that it priced its plans too low to cover its medical costs. Some smaller insurers have already gone out of business. But if an insurer prices a plan too high, it might not attract enough healthy people to break even. Companies both large and small now plan to raise prices sharply for 2017, which could prevent even more people from buying policies. “The price competition has turned out to be much more cutthroat than anyone expected,” said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the law. Still, most experts say there is no immediate danger that the market will collapse. Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that the Obama administration was confident that the marketplaces would “continue to thrive for years ahead. ” The department said on Thursday that the people entering the marketplaces are becoming more mixed over time, and the marketplaces are attracting more young and healthy people over all. The major insurers, though, say the healthy people are going to other plans, often the least expensive ones offered by their smaller competitors. Some defenders of the law say it is working as intended, harnessing competition to keep premiums as low as possible. “We have to be realistic,” said Linda J. Blumberg, a health care expert at the Urban Institute, noting that some large companies may not be nimble enough to succeed. “You can’t lower costs without breaking some eggs. ” Not every insurance company is struggling. The exceptions seem to be those that offer the most limited choice of doctors and hospitals and may pay them the least, including plans offered by companies like Molina and Centene, which previously specialized in covering   Medicaid patients. The insurers faring the worst sell plans that resemble those traditionally offered through employers. The plans give customers much greater latitude over where to get care and cover some of the   doctors and   hospitals. The trouble is that people signing up for those plans are less healthy  —   and more expensive to treat  —   than anticipated. The companies also say that the provisions of the law aimed at stabilizing the market and protecting them from heavy losses are not working. Several say that consolidation is the answer. Anthem, for example, says the only way it can expand in the marketplaces is by merging with Cigna, a deal the Justice Department is trying to block. Another remedy is to attract a broader range of customers. “We have to get a healthier pool of people in the market,” said Kurt Kossen, an executive at Health Care Service Corporation, which operates nonprofit Blue Cross plans in several states but lost $1. 5 billion last year. The result could be a market essentially left to insurers that offer the same narrow networks found in Medicaid plans and some remaining Blue Cross plans, said Mr. Levitt, of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The market is sustainable but with a different mix of plans,” he said.",0,1198,19.015873015873016,63,0.34641068447412354,0,0,0,0,94.74041391737552,14.964486264987103,64.96197365980338,47.37228714524207,0.8781302170283807,0.04424040066777963,0.07512520868113523,0.028380634390651086,0.04424040066777963,0.005843071786310518,0.1310517529215359,0,0.005843071786310518,0.0025041736227045075,0.09515859766277128,0,0.0709515859766277,0.025041736227045076,0.0008347245409015025,0.01001669449081803,0.012520868113522538,0.10350584307178631,0.0008347245409015025,0.052587646076794656,0.049248747913188645,0.04674457429048414,0,0,0.0325542570951586,0.014190317195325543,0.11769616026711185,0,0.001669449081803005,0.001669449081803005,0,0,0.03589315525876461,0.027545909849749584,0,0,0.4557595993322204,0.02337228714524207,0.015859766277128547,0.001669449081803005,0,0.04674457429048414,0.0008347245409015025,0.0008347245409015025,0.020868113522537562,0.01001669449081803,0.004173622704507512,0.0025041736227045075,0.05843071786310518,0.009181969949916527,0.012520868113522538,0.015859766277128547,0.0008347245409015025,0,0.020868113522537562,0.2637729549248748,0.00667779632721202,0,0.02003338898163606,0.05342237061769616,0.11519198664440734,0.020868113522537562,0.027545909849749584,0.06176961602671119,0.14858096828046743,0.0676126878130217,0.04006677796327212,0.001669449081803005,0.01335559265442404,0.10934891485809682,0,0.00667779632721202,0.010851419031719533,0.00667779632721202,0.0025041736227045075,0,0,0.0008347245409015025,0.08096828046744574,0.07679465776293823,0,0.028380634390651086,0.017529215358931552,0.024207011686143573,0.15525876460767946,0.1327212020033389,0.001669449081803005,0.08180300500834725,0.0008347245409015025,26,0,26.05,0,54.474999999999994,7,17.125,10,8,36.625,5,6,59,0,26,0,154.47500000000002,24.125,105.675,282.275,154.47500000000002,,0.42278843521154125,0,0.42325735851714186,0,0.6054696531385234,0.16471953004969767,0.3254374529854548,0.21979723016032496,0.18392293443878058,0.5078237532130927,0.12346752509553723,0.14459058185587106,0.6243618895915065,0,0.5335332290579192,0,0.11063365024798125,0.01727811498451236,0.07568351506687436,0.2021628977099783,0.6603536068344411,0.7978371022900217,84
375,"NBA Hall of Fame’s Shaquille O’Neal announced he plans on running for sheriff in 2020.  “In 2020, I plan on running for Sheriff,” Shaq told Atlanta’s NBC affiliate WXIA. “This is not about politics for me,” he added. “This is something I always wanted to do. It’s about bringing people closer together. You know, when I was coming up, people loved and respected the police, the deputies. And, I want to be the one to bring that back, especially in the community I serve. ” The   NBA   said he is a perfect fit for the job because he can relate to anyone. “I’m a guy that speaks all languages. I can throw on a suit and have a conversation with Bill Gates, I can go in the hood and talk to the homies, and talk to the children,” Shaq explained. He said he is unsure yet where he would run. He could run for Sheriff in Henry County, GA, where he is a resident and where the incumbent is up for reelection in 2020. Another option for Shaq is in Florida where he also has residency. He could also establish new residency somewhere else and run in that location.

377,"Email Hafnarfjorður, Iceland. The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Iceland’s Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. Now it´s all about coalition building. Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats, now down to 8). This coalition is the same center-right configuration which led Iceland to financial disaster, the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals, and whose members were implicated in off-shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last PM from the Progressive Party, causing these early elections, and now to the formal resignation of their present PM just a few hours ago. Technically these two parties could form a 3-party coalition along with the new Regeneration Party. However, Regeneration leader Benedikt Jóhanesson has said he wouldn´t consider a coalition with the governing parties. Thus that particular scenario is doubted. After years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy, and controversy over the Panama Papers leaking of wealthy Icelanders´ involvement in Tortola, this new development reflects a growing, widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following Iceland’s independence. The ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable. The other numbers however, are pointing to a change of course: The Pirates won 14.5% giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat Parliament, the Althing. The Left-Greens received 15.9% (for 10 Seats); the Social Democrats 5.7% (3 seats) and Bright Future 7.2% (winning 4 seats).Together they represent almost 30% of the electorate. These are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week, just before the election. If a four party coalition is solidified, then Iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable Pirate Party within its government (Germany is the first) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the country´s governance. The kingmakers could very well be Regeneration, a new, center-right grouping who won 10.5% of the votes getting them 7 seats. They characterize themselves as “liberal”, though the head was a long-time supporter of the Independence Party before leaving this past year. On the 18th of October he said he wouldn’t consider joining a coalition with the two-headed ruling hydra of the Independence and Progressive parties. Were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left, center-left groups of which the Pirates are a part (something he declared he was open to the morning after the election), then that would net a total of 34 seats (27 + their 7) and a solid majority. A five party coalition. What does this all mean? It means several things: in the short run, the helm of the Icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the Independence Party as the largest single grouping in the Althingi (Parliament). But aside from that approximately 30% of the electorate who aren´t swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class, the rest of the country is moving on. They are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics (with the Pirates) and considering broad coalition politics (5 groups trying to control the direction of the country). This may be the wave of the future. Or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources (and actually and clearly defining such) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new, dominant ideology. In the long run, things are changing. And then there is this issue of a new Constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved. If that was now formally accepted, then some serious changes may be in store for the Owners of the country. But today is only the day after, and nothing has been decided yet. So what´s next? Well, the new President’s job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and, if they fail in securing a stable majority, the next leading party would get a shot. This was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups. Now, however, a new multi-party dynamic is at play. Who knows how the discussions are heading right now, and which horses are being traded? Iceland has always been the most USAmerican of the Nordic countries but with tugs in both directions. Much like the island itself, rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the European and American tectonic plates, these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow. With history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties´ corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric, it appears Iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the Pirates. But they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and Iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness. In the long run, that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider, just like its geographical counterpart. But it is the Pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people (and, in particular the young). If they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring Edward Snowden here (a publicity stunt at best) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy, then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road.

378,"In a   conference room at Stanford University, a score of scholars, many of them eminent and some from as far away as Johannesburg and Beijing, gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality. The gathering itself had no overt hierarchy, though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others. When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert  —   except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse. Mr. Berggruen, 54, is an investor and art collector who was once known as the “homeless billionaire” because he lived in itinerant luxury in   hotels. Now he is grounded in Los Angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank, the Berggruen Institute. The institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by Bill Gates and George Soros. Sean Parker, one of the entrepreneurs behind Napster and Facebook, has a research institute, The Parker Foundation, which this month pledged $250 million for cancer immunotherapy. He is also a   of the Economic Innovation Group, which labels itself an “ideas laboratory. ” Tom Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager in California, has several environmental nonprofit groups, and last year created the Fair Shake Commission to redress economic inequality. “There is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are ” said James G. McGann, the director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania  —   a think tank that thinks about think tanks. In a   culture where tweets, not position papers, shape the national conversation, these kinds of   “are likely to be more influential than we are,” Mr. McGann said. Mr. Berggruen stands out because he is a   but   player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious  —   a Gatsby who shows up at his own parties. “I am a person who likes to engage in learning,” Mr. Berggruen said, in an accent reflecting his Parisian upbringing and dual German and American citizenship. The next step was “to see if I can produce some ideas,” he said. Mr. Berggruen’s investment company, Berggruen Holdings, is registered in the British Virgin Islands and his charitable trust is based in Bermuda. The institute bankrolls several conferences a year, and Mr. Berggruen attends almost every session, takes careful notes and sometimes even appears to dress the part. At a dinner for philosophy scholars at the Stanford Park Hotel in March, he wore a dark blazer and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to his sternum, the signature look of the French celebrity philosopher   Lévy. There are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor. “One of the delights of philanthropy is that it isn’t programmed, it is scattershot, with so much room for idiosyncratic choices,” said Karl Zinsmeister, author of “The Almanac of American Philanthropy. ” He cited the example of Daniel Guggenheim, who championed the rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot. “Of course there is a high percentage of waste,” Mr. Zinsmeister said, “but that’s how discovery works. ” Others worry, though, that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects. Mr. Berggruen’s institute “seems like a   of his creation,” McGann said, referring to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland  —   the Ascot of conferences for the global elite. Mr. McGann publishes an annual report on the world’s top think tanks, ranking them in more than 50 categories. The Berggruen Institute is not included in any of them. Mr. Berggruen happens to be a Davos habitué, but his institute has a more eclectic mandate. Besides philosophy, he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the California budget. He has established councils to study European integration and China. The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the   academic year. Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif. and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog  de Meuron to design his institute’s headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to “deepen the conversation. ” Mr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. “He knows everyone,” said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a   of LinkedIn. Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen’s interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. “I said, ‘Yeah, that’s interesting. Let me meet him,’” Mr. Hoffman recalled. The luminaries listed on the institute’s advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller’s yacht: Arianna Huffington,   of The Huffington Post the SpaceX founder Elon Musk Tony Blair, the former British prime minister Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. “I’m not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,” Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state’s budget crisis. Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of   questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer. Last November, Mr. Berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in Beijing to discuss the future of China. Upon the group’s arrival in Beijing, the roads were cleared for their motorcade to the Great Hall of the People for a meeting with President Xi Jinping. Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was “astute. ” It also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. “In some ways he is a thinking man’s Donald Trump,” Mr. Schell said. “He doesn’t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence. ” While Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn’t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris. The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1. 5 billion. Last year, Town  Country magazine named him one of the world’s 50 most eligible bachelors. And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: “Me. I am the mother and the father. ” Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors. Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies. Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his   charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life’s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy. Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. “It was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,” Mr. Walker said. “I found him a little mysterious. He didn’t invite personal confidences. ” Mr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn’t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. with little time for small talk. At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. “I am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,” he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. “The West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is  —   and I don’t mean this in a negative way  —   conformist. ” Mr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California’s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012. Think Long was on the winning side, though, of a 2014 measure to make ballot initiatives more transparent. Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, which supported the measure, said that she didn’t recall the Berggruen Institute’s adding much to policy ideas, but that it did help finance legal advisers and recruit experts. “I wouldn’t say it was deep thinking,” Ms. Feng said, “but he did bring in some very   individuals. ” In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge  —   which has become a kind of social register for   philanthropists  —   joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100, 000, the minimum annual gift required many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U. C. L. A. $4, 750. Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is “not just a   operation it’s an ideas and   operation. ” Several scholars say that Mr. Berggruen’s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study. “I can’t say whether it’s the best use of his money,” Professor Appiah said. “I can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better. ”",0,1921,17.623853211009173,109,0.34096824570536177,0,0,0,0,89.77476693010269,8.749704472496962,81.75076325674972,61.30815280502943,0.7954190525767829,0.01353461738677772,0.03748047891723061,0.021343050494534097,0.025507548152004164,0.013014055179593961,0.20510150963040083,0.001041124414367517,0.001041124414367517,0.015616866215512754,0.08537220197813639,0.0005205622071837585,0.05622071837584591,0.012493492972410203,0.0026028110359187923,0.014575741801145237,0.0031233732431025507,0.08953669963560645,0.002082248828735034,0.07235814679854242,0.021343050494534097,0.052576782925559604,0,0.0005205622071837585,0.031233732431025507,0.004685059864653826,0.0827693909422176,0,0.003643935450286309,0.0005205622071837585,0.003643935450286309,0,0.0026028110359187923,0.045809474232170744,0.003643935450286309,0.003643935450286309,0.42946382092660074,0.0031233732431025507,0.018740239458615304,0.004164497657470068,0.008328995314940135,0.04112441436751692,0.001041124414367517,0.006246746486205101,0.02342529932326913,0.016137428422696512,0.008849557522123894,0.0650702758979698,0.021343050494534097,0.00989068193649141,0.012493492972410203,0.0031233732431025507,0.0005205622071837585,0,0.028630921395106715,0.2118688183237897,0.008328995314940135,0,0.024986985944820406,0.07704320666319625,0.08849557522123894,0.05726184279021343,0.021863612701717855,0.04997397188964081,0.12389380530973451,0.09838625715773035,0.021343050494534097,0,0.029672045809474232,0.11244143675169183,0.001041124414367517,0.008849557522123894,0.004685059864653826,0,0.0052056220718375845,0,0.0005205622071837585,0.042165538781884435,0.14107235814679855,0.06871421134825612,0,0.018740239458615304,0.0052056220718375845,0.03331598125976054,0.1202498698594482,0.1166059344091619,0.0005205622071837585,0.06090577824049974,0.001041124414367517,65.25,2,37,0,9,24,20,14,16,47,42.65,46,59,0,65.25,1,214.9,44,86,333.9,214.9,,0.5828991063751853,0.041075799742385115,0.44210529522744185,0,0.16160754219982615,0.3395082810929927,0.2998929226934271,0.23067872060282768,0.25522220473775475,0.5016518749446421,0.47738723495465807,0.49627539854516206,0.5582338685140773,0,0.33003077695544836,0.02096854984842359,0.09944930353093619,0.020361886251099078,0.03979823221805729,0.15451895043731775,0.796095989545088,0.8454810495626822,94
379,"It happened so fast: One moment I was running trails, the next I was staring a   sow in the face, so close I could smell it, wild and pungent and alarming, and I knew it could smell me, too, my fear. I was in the middle of a rainy   run in Far North Bicentennial Park on the outskirts of Anchorage, where I live. It was late July, a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the   salmon swimming up Campbell Creek. But I was miles from the water. I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadn’t seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting. I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips. Then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me. It’s impossible to run the trails around Alaska without thinking about bears. There are piles of scat everywhere, dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun, reminders that you have to be careful. You have to be versed in bear awareness, bear etiquette and bear protocol. Headphones are a   and going alone is discouraged. Making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended. Still, I often ran alone. I preferred it that way. I liked the serenity and the loneliness, liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees. That day, I wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack, and I sang, too, whenever I came to dense areas. I sang old rock ’n’ roll songs, loudly and badly. I was cautious but not afraid. I ran these trails all summer and the summer before, and while I saw bears on many other trails, I only twice saw them on these sections. Maybe I let down my guard. Maybe I felt invincible, the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results. Maybe the bear was having a bad day. When the bear charged, time stood still. I felt every millisecond. I stood in the drizzle, rain coating my face like tears, and I did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges: I waved my arms and yelled. “I’m human!” I cried, my voice rising through the birch trees, through that silent and   moment. “I’m a person!” The bear paused and ran back toward the brush. A minute later, it charged a second time. And again I waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped, this time so close I could almost reach out and touch its snout. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t swallow. I wondered, briefly and almost idly, if this was how I would die. Suddenly, I wanted to talk to my son, who was grown and off living his own life. I wanted to hear his voice. A lifetime later, the bear turned and ran off, its backside swaying into the trees. I had to get back to the trail, to the possibility of safety, yet I couldn’t step away from the alders. It was my only protection. That’s when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc. That’s when I knew I was in trouble, became really afraid. When my son was young and nothing would comfort him, I would talk. It didn’t matter what I said, he needed my voice, the steady flow of words. As I stepped from the shelter of the alders, I talked out loud, my voice surprisingly calm. I talked to the bear to show that I meant no harm, but mostly I talked to reassure myself. As the bear circled for a second time, I stumbled through devil’s club, snagging my shorts and scratching my legs, and I talked about the day my son was born, how I recognized his face immediately. When I reached the trail, I kept talking. The bear followed, but I didn’t look back. A half a mile later, I glanced over my shoulder, and the bear was gone. I started running and didn’t stop until I encountered two hikers, and I collapsed at their feet. For weeks I saw that bear’s face in my dreams, and I woke up, heart pounding. I swore I would never run trails again, but I missed it too much, and soon I was out with the trees and that big, big sky. Some things are worth the risk, though I made sure to carry a canister of bear spray, just in case. And sometimes even now when I’m running, I think of that bear charging and how I stood there, so still and yet so alive. It opened something inside of me that can never be closed. It offered a taste of the unknown: At any time I might find myself crouched in the brush, face to face with my own fragile existence. So much of life is chance. There are no guarantees. But there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck.",0,919,14.587301587301587,63,0.2089227421109902,0,0,0,0,45.81959009434526,95.90758686294235,12.21818302946859,11.63327613626852,0.8552774755168662,0.001088139281828074,0.03373231773667029,0.07072905331882481,0.03482045701849837,0.001088139281828074,0.17301414581066377,0.002176278563656148,0.006528835690968444,0.018498367791077257,0.07725788900979326,0,0.062023939064200215,0.02720348204570185,0.018498367791077257,0.006528835690968444,0.011969532100108813,0.09249183895538629,0.003264417845484222,0.07834602829162132,0.014145810663764961,0.09031556039173014,0,0.002176278563656148,0.023939064200217627,0.02176278563656148,0.03482045701849837,0.002176278563656148,0.003264417845484222,0.011969532100108813,0,0,0.00544069640914037,0.08269858541893363,0,0,0.5527747551686616,0.00544069640914037,0.017410228509249184,0.001088139281828074,0.11316648531011969,0.04461371055495103,0,0.003264417845484222,0.01632208922742111,0.018498367791077257,0.011969532100108813,0.008705114254624592,0.001088139281828074,0.03917301414581066,0.01958650707290533,0.022850924918389554,0,0,0.007616974972796518,0.2176278563656148,0,0,0.04461371055495103,0.06637649619151251,0.017410228509249184,0.12731229597388466,0.011969532100108813,0.009793253536452665,0.11316648531011969,0.1719260065288357,0.008705114254624592,0,0.004352557127312296,0.1882480957562568,0.001088139281828074,0.00544069640914037,0.017410228509249184,0.007616974972796518,0.01088139281828074,0,0,0.00544069640914037,0.03482045701849837,0.07616974972796518,0,0.022850924918389554,0.003264417845484222,0.0794341675734494,0.13166485310119697,0.14907508161044614,0,0,0.00544069640914037,12,0,41,3,24,9,15,11,7.905000000000001,57.375,21.25,6,8.625,0,12,17,81.50999999999999,48,143.625,259.885,81.50999999999999,,0.252650308587072,0,0.5359723832719583,0.07792920551222468,0.403385217494656,0.2022631961725015,0.2970504159217057,0.23657705503474508,0.18213665149283062,0.6177892373847422,0.37447257499213116,0.14459058185587106,0.1954830222014777,0,0.5313778368517763,0.32383124395073204,0.0735726180966436,0.04332579644999256,0.1296389065652121,0.23457759605013154,-0.7122070959638421,0.7654224039498685,71
380,"Ve la película de su vida y descubre que ha llevado siempre un trozo de lechuga entre los dientes NOTICIA PATROCINADA POR SAMSUNG Verano Azul Jordi Carrasco, un informático de Tarragona de 33 años, sufrió ayer una experiencia cercana a la muerte al atragantarse con un “dorito” y, en unos pocos segundos, pudo ver el transcurso de su vida pasar por delante de él “como en una película en definición 4K y formato panorámico”. Pese a lo impresionante de la calidad de imagen, Carrasco lamenta que el guión de su vida no estuviera a la altura. “Además, con tanta definición en la imagen he comprobado que llevo treinta años con un trozo de lechuga entre los dientes y nadie jamás me ha avisado”, lamenta. “Los mejores momentos de mi vida, mi primer ordenador, mi primera novia online… todos los momentos memorables en la existencia de un informático se vieron empañados por un simple trozo de lechuga. Qué pena de vida y qué pena dedicar la última tecnología a esto”, se queja. Tras una profunda remodelación de sus instalaciones, la antesala de la muerte ha adquirido varios televisores Samsung con tecnología Quantum dot que permiten a los usuarios como Jordi vivir una experiencia más realista. Esto, por supuesto, pide que las vidas de las personas estén a la altura de los avances tecnológicos. La misma tecnología, además, ha permitido destapar grandes mentiras del pasado: la popular doña Rogelia, personaje de “Mari Carmen y sus muñecos”, era en realidad el actor Quique San Francisco. Por si esto fuera poco, los detalles en alta definición de la serie “Verano Azul” muestran que Chanquete fingió su muerte para huir de la atención mediática y pasó a formar parte de un programa de protección de testigos.",1,291,32.333333333333336,9,0.36769759450171824,0,0,0,0,94.44013527518682,1,50,64.8491790759832,0.10996563573883161,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0.020618556701030927,0,0.140893470790378,0,0,0,0.024054982817869417,0,0,0,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0.010309278350515464,0.003436426116838488,0.061855670103092786,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03436426116838488,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0.003436426116838488,0,0.013745704467353952,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0.003436426116838488,0.003436426116838488,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0.013745704467353952,0,0.006872852233676976,0.013745704467353952,0.003436426116838488,0,0.013745704467353952,0.030927835051546393,0.010309278350515464,0.006872852233676976,0.020618556701030927,0.006872852233676976,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0,0.041237113402061855,0.010309278350515464,0,0,0,0,0.006872852233676976,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0.006872852233676976,0,0,0,0,0.010309278350515464,0,0,0,0.003436426116838488,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,2,7,5,,0,0.22966848451216434,0,0,0,0,0,0.12973190755680383,0,0,0,0,0.06936540706703205,0,0,0,0.017123287671232876,0,0.00684931506849315,0.023972602739726026,0.24025307335204216,0.976027397260274,6
381,"Thursday night’s Congressional Baseball Game took on added meaning and importance after the shooting at the Republican practice on Wednesday, which left Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise seriously wounded. [The Democrats would go on to win the game, convincingly, by a final  . Though, the postgame scene became one of unity and camaraderie as the Democrats presented the trophy to Scalise, who is still in critical condition after the attack. Representative Joe Barton of Texas accepted the trophy on Scalise’s behalf.  According to ESPN: A huge ovation came from the crowd, which swelled to a record 24, 959, when Special Agent David Bailey, one of the Capitol Police officers injured in the attack on Republicans at their ball practice in Virginia, threw out the first pitch. “ONE FAMILY,” proclaimed a sign in the crowd. The announcer’s mention of Scalise, the House majority whip who was critically wounded in the attack Wednesday, brought the masses to their feet. The highlight of the evening featured President Donald Trump delivering a video message to the assembled crowd. The    said, “By playing tonight we are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence or assaults on our democracy. The game will go on. ” ESPN reported, “When the president intoned three words he said have brought Americans together for generations —  ”Let’s play ball” —  cheers rang out. ” While the game provides some relief and bipartisanship in a town dominated by faction and division, the other more important aspect of the game has to do with how it benefits various charities. This year, the charities are the “Boys  Girls Club of Greater Washington, Washington Literacy Center, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and, after Wednesday’s shooting, the Capitol Police Memorial Fund. ” After Thursday’s result, the   record in the game is 39 wins each, for both Democrats and Republicans, with one tie.

382,"The strict French gun control that makes it extremely difficult for   citizens to defend themselves has proven little more than a paper tiger when it comes to prohibiting terrorists and public attackers from acquiring the guns they need to kill innocents. [The April 20 attack on a police patrol on the Champs Élysées illustrates this perfectly in light of the fact that the alleged attacker —  Karim Cheurfi —  was previously jailed for shooting at officers with a . 38 Special revolver. The Daily Mail reports that Cheurfi was imprisoned “in 2005 for trying to kill two policemen” and wounding a third person with the revolver.  On Thursday he allegedly used a Kalashnikov to kill two officers. He was then shot dead, and upon searching his car, police discovered more weapons, “including a pump action shotgun. ” The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy. org describes French gun laws as “restrictive,” yet they were powerless to stop Cheurfi, just as they offered no hindrance to the    who entered the Alexis de Tocqueville high school in Grasse   and opened fire. Despite universal background checks —  “which [consider] criminal, mental health and [physical] health” issues —  The Local reports the    was able to enter the school carrying “a revolver, a pistol, a hunting rifle and two grenades. ” Consider the November 13, 2015, terror attack on unarmed Parisians. In that attack, multiple terrorists opened fire with   or   rifles. They killed 130 innocents. The universal background checks were not a hindrance, and the rest of the French gun laws were powerless to prevent the attack. It is important to note that A Review of French Gun Laws (2012) shows that the background check in France is an ongoing process rather than a one time event. Such checks entail acquiring and maintaining “an active shooting club [membership]” and going to the range “at least three times a year. ” They also include “seeing a doctor every year,” who declares one “physically and mentally capable of owning a firearm,” and filling out various pieces of paperwork as well. Yet 130 innocents were gunned down on November 13, 2015. And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Twelve innocents —  including two police officers —  were gunned down by armed terrorists who were not hindered by strict gun control. French police unions responded to the Charlie Hebdo attack by explaining that gun control simply was not working for them they could not continue to walk the streets of Paris presuming that terrorists would not acquire arms. The Associated Press reported that the police unions demanded “more” guns and “heavier” guns, as well as “protective gear, better training for   and more legal tools to guard against terrorists. ” Gun control reduces   citizens’ ability to defend themselves and places police officers at a marked disadvantage. On the other hand, it poses no hindrance to determined terrorists who target citizens and police officers alike.

383,"52 Views October 31, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News With most markets on lockdown on Halloween trading day, here is a big picture view of where the world is headed. Stephen Leeb: “This past week a New York Times headline that caught my eye was: “At Heart of U.S. Strategy; Weapons That Can Think.” The gist was that over the next few years the U.S. will be spending billions of dollars to make “smart” weapons, while also boosting our cyber budget by billions of dollars. It struck me as another example of how anytime we in the U.S. pound our chest about our mighty military, we always point to how much money have spent and plan to spend… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Michael O’Harlan and David Petraeus, men with exceptional military pedigrees, declare: “U.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses and in many areas…they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries…Nor is this likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States’ closest competitor, China.” Reassuring words? Maybe for a moment. But as soon as you think about it, they become anything but reassuring, showing that even when it comes to our most vital security issues, we make the fundamentally flawed assumption that money equates to wealth. I’ve long been convinced that if the U.S. continues on what appears an ever more inevitable slide, historians will point to the day Nixon dropped the gold standard as launching that skid. Gold is wealth; paper is merely money. Money can facilitate the exchange of wealth, but by itself it is just paper or entries on a computer ledger and a very poor substitute for wealth. Commodities are wealth, and many vital commodities, as we pointed in a recent interview, can’t even be purchased any more – period. Information is also wealth. And no amount of money can guarantee an edge in information. A few weeks ago, a 15- or 16-year-old who had recently become interested in chess wrote a letter to a chess blog asking how much he’d need to spend to become a Grand Master – how much for training, how much for practice time, coaches, etc. The only possible answer: not all the money in the world could turn a novice who’s already a teenager into a world-class player. Grand masters have a wealth of knowledge and savvy that can’t be acquired once you’re much past 7 or 8 years old. You’ve missed the boat. Similarly, no amount of money enabled U.S. experts to crack the cell phone of the San Bernardino terrorists. But cyber experts from Israel, which spends a lot less on cyber issues, cracked it with relative ease. Israel, along with China and Russia, are among a number of countries, mostly located in Asia, that develop the skills of their gifted children at early ages. This has left the U.S. a poor second in critical areas ranging from cyber security to super computers, which will be the most essential tools in the next generation of a gold-centered monetary system. Even nonbelievers should be starting to perceive the inevitability of gold replacing paper. A few metrics tell the story. First is the relationship between the dollar and economic growth. Despite the recent report of better-than-expected third-quarter GDP, the economy’s growth has been declining as the dollar has risen. In the wake of the Great Recession the dollar traded in a fairly tight range, while GDP growth in fits and starts peaked at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The higher dollar has held GDP growth to less than 2 percent for the past two years. But commodities have begun to rise. Most major commodity indexes have climbed 10 percent or more this year. Even the temporary setback in obtaining an OPEC agreement won’t hold back real goods. Recently, for the first time since China announced its Silk Road initiative in 2013, a major article on the undertaking appeared in a major magazine, Foreign Affairs. Gal Luft , a senior advisor to the United States Energy Security Council, urged Washington to get aboard or lose out on the chance to benefit from the greatest infrastructure project in the history of civilization, many times the size of the Marshall Plan and already the destination of $1 trillion in Chinese exports this year, with dramatic growth likely for the foreseeable future. But instead we’re likely to continue to use our dollars in ways that bear ever less connection to real wealth. Bear in mind that any effort to hold inflation down will crumble in the face of Western economies even weaker than ours. The result is that real interest rates will remain negative, an unalloyed positive for gold. At the same time the currency used along the Silk Road will be some combination of gold, the SDR, and the yuan. As we have said before, China’s edge in critical information technologies ensures its domination in virtual currencies such as the bitcoin, which will have multiple advantages in tomorrow’s gold-based world. How High Will Gold & Silver Trade? How high will gold go? Much depends on how much trade the Silk Road generates. Which means that if think gold could go to five digits, you don’t need a shrink – you’re sane as can be. And let’s not overlook gold’s poor cousin, which in the end could make you even richer, silver. The energies of our future will be anchored to solar, nuclear, and wind. The solar anchor will mean that already peaking silver will become some of the scarcest wealth around. If you’re dreaming of $100 silver, your dreams will be coming true before long. To me it’s an ironic footnote to the Nixon years. Yes, history will record that America’s decline began when the much-maligned Nixon delinked the dollar from gold and let us conflate money and wealth. Meanwhile, though, you can make a fortune on the coming bull market in gold that will be the direct result of that decision.”   The Coming Super Depression,   Cyberwars, $10,000 Gold & $1,000 Silver CLICK  ",1,1089,18.775862068965516,58,0.2938475665748393,0,0,0,0,90.96627512189916,43.49576981940617,65.02499744923988,69.06578774760592,0.8337924701561065,0.018365472910927456,0.06703397612488522,0.04132231404958678,0.048668503213957756,0.017447199265381085,0.17079889807162535,0.004591368227731864,0.0009182736455463728,0.01928374655647383,0.09274563820018365,0.0009182736455463728,0.06978879706152434,0.0073461891643709825,0.004591368227731864,0.02295684113865932,0.011019283746556474,0.10651974288337925,0.004591368227731864,0.05693296602387511,0.03856749311294766,0.05693296602387511,0.009182736455463728,0,0.02662993572084481,0.010101010101010102,0.08172635445362718,0,0.0009182736455463728,0.0036730945821854912,0.0009182736455463728,0,0.027548209366391185,0.02203856749311295,0,0,0.4508723599632691,0.0027548209366391185,0.005509641873278237,0,0.0036730945821854912,0.04040404040404041,0.009182736455463728,0,0.01652892561983471,0.018365472910927456,0.008264462809917356,0.0027548209366391185,0.050505050505050504,0.020202020202020204,0.009182736455463728,0.012855831037649219,0.008264462809917356,0,0.028466483011937556,0.2497704315886134,0.010101010101010102,0,0.01928374655647383,0.05876951331496786,0.07529843893480258,0.03673094582185491,0.03581267217630854,0.04040404040404041,0.13957759412304868,0.07713498622589532,0.03673094582185491,0.0027548209366391185,0.0073461891643709825,0.16437098255280075,0,0.0073461891643709825,0.004591368227731864,0.0027548209366391185,0.0073461891643709825,0.0018365472910927456,0,0.0009182736455463728,0.048668503213957756,0.07713498622589532,0,0.03397612488521579,0.0027548209366391185,0.06887052341597796,0.12672176308539945,0.1147842056932966,0.013774104683195593,0.02662993572084481,0.015610651974288337,45.254999999999995,0,28.3,0,9,17,37.25,13,1.83,21.05,25,85.25,16,0,45.254999999999995,1,194.74000000000004,54.25,89.07499999999999,299.81500000000005,194.74000000000004,,0.570581860391384,0,0.45382548052528277,0,0.20901664002472214,0.33294964000171945,0.5223761196967124,0.27625029819786723,0.05099087711003831,0.38197185232965863,0.42330713700246736,0.7145325364430652,0.31962429613898763,0,0.5320554094202998,0.028523531261305263,0.14924721129048948,0.041576775251664026,0.06826638259063544,0.22977586860972632,0.8143851616431074,0.7702241313902737,84
384,"Former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has gone from one of the most celebrated players in the NFL to washing out. Now, he is appearing in shopping malls to sign photos for money to make ends meet. [As USA Today notes, Manziel will make a Super Bowl appearance of sorts by appearing at a Houston shopping mall during Super Bowl week to sign autographs.  According to Crave Sports Company, the group that contracted with the troubled player for the signing, Manziel will sign any item for $99 a pop or will pose for a selfie for $50 during the   appearance. The   Heisman Trophy winner whose NFL career crashed after only a single season due to his   behavior will appear at the Woodlands Mall in Houston on February 2 and 3. Every NFL team passed Manziel over for the 2016 season, despite the league’s decision to reinstate him after Dallas County prosecutors dropped domestic violence charges against the quarterback last December. Along with the dismissal of the charges, Manziel agreed to attend counseling and will remain under court supervision.

385,"Rock and folk legend Bob Dylan has been accused of lifting sections of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech from a SparkNotes. com summary of Moby Dick. [Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylan’s speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the “Blowin’ in the Wind” singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes  —   a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts  —   but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: “Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness” From SparkNotes: “someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness. ” Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylan’s lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel. The Nobel Foundation awarded Dylan the prestigious prize in October, which sparked considerable controversy over the very definition of literature, and and the enigmatic music legend didn’t acknowledge the honor for weeks. The musician declined to attend December’s Nobel ceremony in Stockholm, citing scheduling issues. The Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize, published Dylan’s speech on June 5, in the form of a   recording, and called it “extraordinary” and “eloquent” in a press release. The organization has not responded to the accusations. While Dylan has not responded to the accusations, however, he has been accused of borrowing phrases from other artists in the past. “It is nothing new that Mr. Dylan might take inspiration from a   work to prepare something else,” Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer and musician, told the Associated Press. “Songwriters, including Dylan, have been borrowing from other literary works to turn pop phrases for ages. Consider Led Zeppelin’s ample use of Tolkien’s classic works in many of their songs. ” The “surprise here is that rather than borrowing from classic literature, Mr. Dylan took his ‘inspiration’ this time from crib notes,” Weinberg said. “But that should not raise eyebrows either. Even John Lennon was known to use things as ordinary as a newspaper clipping or circus posters to embellish lyrics. ” Listen to the lecture in full below:   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",0,393,21.833333333333332,18,0.35877862595419846,0,0,0,0,96.83794424405112,22.86585961395121,41.939909962810724,64.36339647535576,0.7150127226463104,0.020356234096692113,0.03307888040712468,0.017811704834605598,0.030534351145038167,0.002544529262086514,0.2010178117048346,0.005089058524173028,0,0.022900763358778626,0.089058524173028,0,0.05089058524173028,0.010178117048346057,0.010178117048346057,0.017811704834605598,0.002544529262086514,0.10941475826972011,0.010178117048346057,0.061068702290076333,0.020356234096692113,0.043256997455470736,0,0,0.05089058524173028,0.007633587786259542,0.04834605597964377,0,0,0.005089058524173028,0,0,0.005089058524173028,0.05089058524173028,0,0,0.42748091603053434,0.002544529262086514,0.02544529262086514,0,0,0.05597964376590331,0.007633587786259542,0,0.02544529262086514,0.010178117048346057,0.030534351145038167,0.017811704834605598,0.007633587786259542,0.022900763358778626,0.015267175572519083,0.005089058524173028,0.002544529262086514,0,0.010178117048346057,0.16030534351145037,0.010178117048346057,0,0.03816793893129771,0.04834605597964377,0.089058524173028,0.01272264631043257,0.02544529262086514,0.022900763358778626,0.15776081424936386,0.06870229007633588,0.010178117048346057,0,0.04834605597964377,0.10687022900763359,0.005089058524173028,0.015267175572519083,0,0,0.002544529262086514,0,0.005089058524173028,0.010178117048346057,0.05089058524173028,0.05343511450381679,0.005089058524173028,0.01272264631043257,0.002544529262086514,0.03307888040712468,0.12213740458015267,0.10178117048346055,0,0.04580152671755725,0,24,0,32,0,3,0,0,22,7.725,3,0,7.45,26.375,6,24,10,61.825,10,47,118.825,61.825,,0.5584815598877471,0,0.6277751344091433,0,0.1365270594958143,0,0,0.5369302327239833,0.28934029929739924,0.1365270594958143,0,0.2819442242038984,0.581604760384277,0.24025307335204216,0.20856217852254144,0.3451409985003952,0.12911815381402392,0.02088445674306897,0.09815694669242417,0.24815955724951705,0.5249384191775194,0.751840442750483,33
386,"ERIN, Wis. —  On the heels of a fiery blimp crash and evidence of E. coli at a hydration station, the U. S. Open lost a spectator on Friday to a sudden death. [Washington County Sheriff Dale Schmidt informed the United States Golf Association (USGA) that the decedent was a    male who appeared to die of natural causes. The death follows a dramatic fire on a commercial blimp high above the course that resulted in a crash and serious injuries for the pilot and evidence of E. coli bacteria found at a   hydration station connected to a well.  Here is video of the blimp crash from @msiggyy.

(: @FOXSports) pic. twitter.   —   GOLF. com (@golf_com) June 15, 2017,  The unfortunate series of events has not dampened enthusiasm around Erin Hills as the U. S. Open heads into the weekend with the national championship on the line. Fans tried to find some solace in the passing of the elderly man. Kate Hoffmann of nearby Hartland, Wisconsin sympathized: “Very sad news about the man passing away, you just hope he was enjoying his final day watching the sport he loved. ” Emergency personnel performed CPR by the   grandstand on the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, man but he could not be revived. He was taken to an ambulance and soon thereafter pronounced dead. Out of respect for the family, the USGA is not providing additional information at the moment. Play continued without interruption as Rickie Fowler stumbled on Day Two in his try to win his first major championship and Brooks Koepka, Brian Harman, and Paul Casey surged into a   tie for first. While golf is the focus of the fans, some, such as Marcus Stout of Leesburg, Virginia, worried: “Blimp crash, E. coli, fan dying.

387,"What might the American economy look like if   had not engaged in decades of brutal betrayal against American workers? [A new report from the Congressional Budget Office provides an   answer to the question by examining a sector of the labor market whose wages have been largely shielded from the effects of trade deals, immigration, and   regulation. These workers receive wages and benefits that are, on average, about 17 percent higher than workers with comparable skills and education in other parts of the economy.  The compensation gap is striking. The workers in the protected sector are better compensated than unprotected peers at every level of educational attainment aside from those with professional degrees or doctorates. The compensation gap is largest, in fact, for those workers who would otherwise be among the most vulnerable in the economy: workers with no more than a high school degree. According to the CBO study, the total compensation for protected workers with a high school diploma or less earned 53 percent more than their unprotected peers. So who are these protected workers? They are members of the federal government’s civilian workforce. The federal government employs about 1. 5 percent of the U. S. workforce, around 2. 2 million workers. They are spread across more than 100 agencies and over 650 occupations. In fiscal year 2016, the federal government spent around $215 billion to compensate these workers. On average, they tend to be older, more educated, and more concentrated in professional occupations than   workers. The CBO studied data from 2011 through 2015 to estimate the differences between the wages and benefits of federal employees and similar   employees. It sorted the data by level of education, years of work experience, occupation, size of employer, geographic location, veteran status, and demographic characteristics such as ages, sex, race, and marital status. What it found was that federal workers tend to earn far more than their private sector counterparts. Between 2010 and 2015, federal workers with a high school degree or less had wages that were 34 percent higher than private sector peers and benefits that were 93 percent greater, for a total compensation gap of 53 percent. For workers with a bachelor’s degree, the wage gap was 21 percent, composed of a 5 percent wage gap and a 52 percent benefit gap. Aside from those with the highest levels of education, the compensation gap has grown in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010, for example, the total compensation gap for workers with a high school diploma or less was 36 percent. The gap for those with a bachelor’s degree was 15 percent. An adjustment to whom is counted as a federal employee caused some of this difference. But the larger part of it was caused by the fact that wages grew more quickly among less educated federal workers than those in the private sector. This is even more striking because lawmakers froze    salary increases for federal workers between 2011 through 2013. Without this freeze, the gap would have grown even larger. Federal workers are shielded from a lot of the effects of globalization that have depressed private sector worker compensation. Their jobs are not easily or often subject to   the practice of replacing employees in the U. S. with employees located in foreign countries. Similarly, outsourcing does not weigh on federal workers the way it does private sector workers. Competition from immigrants is far less of a factor because the U. S. government has stringent rules against hiring illegal immigrants and does not directly seek workers from abroad to fill jobs. While the federal government hires immigrant workers, it does so from the pool that is already legally residing in the United States. Trade hardly impacts federal worker compensation at all. Civilian federal employees working in the Defense Department, the largest group of federal workers, are not in wage competition with defense workers in foreign lands. That is true for almost all federal workers, in fact. From the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to the U. S. Treasury and the Justice Department, the wage competition faced by employees is purely domestic. Unlike the private sector, where employment and wages are depressed because of regulation, the federal government benefits from increased regulation. Each new regulation requires employees to enforce and monitor compliance. And most regulations impose few barriers to projects that the federal government pursues.  Look at it from the    of the agencies. They are confined to hiring, for the most part, American citizens and legal residents. They compete with other government agencies and the private sector for workers. While the private sector can turn abroad for workers, the federal agencies cannot. The result is higher wages and better benefits for federal workers. Importantly, many of the   sources of wage stagnation that impact the private sector also weigh on the federal sector. Communications technology, for example, has made many occupations once filled by workers in the federal government redundant. Robotics, improved computer processing, and the Great Recession —  recall that wage   wage freeze —  have all hit federal workers. Yet the compensation grew. That leaves the effects of trade and immigration policy as the most likely culprits. The absence of a wage gap for those with a doctorate or professional degree is telling. In the private sector, these are workers who have faired relatively well in the age of globalization. Many have seen the demand for their work —  and therefore their prosperity —  rise as lawyers, bankers, and other professions ply their trade internationally. So it is no surprise that the federal workers with advanced degrees earn 18 percent less than private sector counterparts. This fact also undermines a competing narrative explaining the wage gap —  that it is a result of a reckless federal government that spends   and cannot resist pressure for higher wages. If that were so, all federal workers would be expected to earn more. The compensation gap could also explain why so many federal workers do not look favorably on President Donald Trump. They just have not experienced the economic impact of globalization the way many of Donald Trump’s private sector supporters have. The CBO report is a glimpse into a shadow world, an alternate reality of an American economy absent the trade and immigration policy decisions that have dragged down all but the best educated and highest earning segments of the American workforce. It shows us an America where a worker without a high school diploma is far better paid and the rewards to the elites are far less grand. It is the world without the carnage that globalization has sown in the American economy. It is, more hopefully, a roadmap to making America great again.",0,1114,16.144927536231883,69,0.3994614003590664,0,0,0,0,95.83649895715882,22.299439638757406,47.12746858168761,52.72531418312388,0.8716337522441652,0.05475763016157989,0.06822262118491922,0.026032315978456014,0.03052064631956912,0.003590664272890485,0.11938958707360861,0.0008976660682226212,0.0017953321364452424,0.003590664272890485,0.10053859964093358,0,0.06104129263913824,0.004488330341113106,0,0.01526032315978456,0.01436265709156194,0.09066427289048475,0.0008976660682226212,0.0466786355475763,0.05206463195691203,0.05206463195691203,0,0,0.03770197486535009,0.00718132854578097,0.12746858168761221,0,0,0.0026929982046678637,0,0,0.0026929982046678637,0.02064631956912029,0,0,0.44344703770197486,0.0017953321364452424,0,0.0017953321364452424,0,0.04757630161579892,0.004488330341113106,0.0017953321364452424,0.010771992818671455,0.008976660682226212,0.0008976660682226212,0.0017953321364452424,0.04488330341113106,0.011669658886894075,0.012567324955116697,0.00807899461400359,0.003590664272890485,0.0008976660682226212,0.026929982046678635,0.21903052064631956,0.0062836624775583485,0,0.010771992818671455,0.06014362657091562,0.1822262118491921,0.01526032315978456,0.02244165170556553,0.09515260323159784,0.14721723518850988,0.06283662477558348,0.05116696588868941,0.0017953321364452424,0,0.1229802513464991,0,0.017055655296229804,0.0062836624775583485,0.0017953321364452424,0.0062836624775583485,0,0.0008976660682226212,0,0.03859964093357271,0.09694793536804308,0,0.018850987432675045,0.010771992818671455,0.017055655296229804,0.08258527827648116,0.0843806104129264,0.0008976660682226212,0.16427289048473967,0.003590664272890485,41.25,0,27.5075,0,0,0,8.125,11,4,26.85,32,2,14,0,41.25,0,83.25,9.125,79.3575,171.7325,83.25,,0.5261590243481328,0,0.4254448664984184,0,0,0,0.17946539801233105,0.2284605747912213,0.09720924117892499,0.41954205817686135,0.4627731453495209,0.05108771982850788,0.27371361265894245,0,0.3499663518778249,0,0.06758772704300649,0.007408264375584795,0.06442754412991457,0.13942353554850584,0.129060168781264,0.8605764644514942,54
388,"On The News Line ©AFP These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: The Syria conundrum The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. It’s been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters. EU threat of disintegration Things seem to be falling apart in Europe which many believe is under strain from many factors ranging from the Brexit to the rise of the far-right across the European political spectrum to the refugee crisis, which is the worst to hit the continent. The prospect of the European Union seems so bleak that it has rung the alarm in Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned: ""The financial crisis, the refugee influx into Europe and the shock from the Brexit referendum in Great Britain have brought the European Union into violent turmoil.” Steinmeier warned that this might lead to the collapse of the EU. Saudis aim to starve Yemenis Reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is ""deliberately targeting impoverished Yemen’s farms and agricultural industry."" Increasing evidence suggests that the kingdom is not merely bombing civilians, but it is systematically targeting infrastructure survivors will need to avoid starvation when the war is over. That includes water infrastructures, and even farms.

389,"Friday on ESPN’s “SportsNation,”   and CNN contributor LZ Granderson reacted to the Tampa Bay Buccanneers signing free agent quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to be Jameis Winston’s backup.  Granderson argued that if Kaepernick remains a free agent when the season begins, then it would be “justified” to say the quarterback has been “blackballed” by NFL owners. “I know that [Kaepernick] is probably asking for a certain amount of money that teams haven’t been willing to pay,” Granderson stated. “I also know that Kap is probably looking to be a starter where Fitzpatrick is just looking to have a job. With that being said though, when you see Mark Sanchez secure a job, when you see Ryan Fitzpatrick   …     secure a job, you go, ‘All right, this is adding more and more fuel to this conversation about whether or not Colin Kaepernick is unfairly being blackballed’ because he has the courage to stand up for what he believes in. ” He continued, “I’m thinking the NFL, if they start this season with Colin Kaepernick out of it, I think every bit of criticism about him being blackballed has been justified because if Ryan Fitzpatrick has a job making $3 million, the way he played in New Jersey?” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0,212,30.285714285714285,7,0.3018867924528302,0,0,0,0,59.87191374663072,18.252422233554306,61.154571843251084,89.17804459691253,0.8018867924528302,0.0047169811320754715,0.02830188679245283,0.05188679245283019,0.06132075471698113,0.014150943396226415,0.19339622641509435,0.009433962264150943,0,0.02358490566037736,0.06132075471698113,0,0.10377358490566038,0.0047169811320754715,0,0.02830188679245283,0.014150943396226415,0.1179245283018868,0,0.05660377358490566,0.009433962264150943,0.07075471698113207,0,0,0.03773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,0.04245283018867924,0,0,0,0,0,0.0047169811320754715,0.02358490566037736,0,0,0.4811320754716981,0,0.009433962264150943,0.0047169811320754715,0.018867924528301886,0.05188679245283019,0.0047169811320754715,0.0047169811320754715,0.0330188679245283,0.02830188679245283,0.018867924528301886,0.02358490566037736,0.018867924528301886,0.009433962264150943,0.009433962264150943,0.009433962264150943,0.0047169811320754715,0,0.018867924528301886,0.28773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,0,0.02830188679245283,0.02830188679245283,0.07075471698113207,0.06132075471698113,0.04716981132075472,0.009433962264150943,0.11320754716981132,0.11320754716981132,0.0330188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0.06132075471698113,0.10849056603773585,0,0.009433962264150943,0.009433962264150943,0,0.018867924528301886,0,0,0.02358490566037736,0.08018867924528301,0.04245283018867924,0,0.02830188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0.05660377358490566,0.1509433962264151,0.18867924528301888,0,0.03773584905660377,0.014150943396226415,7,0,9,0,3,0,0,3,1,0,12,1,1,0,7,0,24,0,10,34,24,,0.3717045820153256,0,0.43202434060666256,0,0.2022631961725015,0,0,0.2022631961725015,0.0779292055122247,0,0.5035213014023038,0.0779292055122247,0.0779292055122247,0,0,0,0.10344827586206896,0,0.04310344827586207,0.14655172413793102,0.6259333038510271,0.853448275862069,14

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/prescription-painkiller-deaths-dropped.html In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, you’ll likely agree that it’s much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids.For the study , researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers.“ The difference is quite striking ,” said Colleen Barry, the study’s co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek .It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects. In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually ( source ).While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain. “You don’t have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,” he argues. The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths.While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

391,"One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year’s remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth. The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a   trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the   War II era. This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe. This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States,   gross domestic product rose by an average of 2. 2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000  —   but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0. 9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that. Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000,   G. D. P.  —   which generally tracks with the average American’s income  —   was about $45, 000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20, 000. To make matters worse, fewer and fewer people are seeing the spoils of what growth there is. According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. That number was 97 percent in Italy, 70 percent in Britain, and 63 percent in France. Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What’s worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle. It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine  —   and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren’t up to the task of fixing it (though some   policies could help). The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future  —   that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents  —   is thrown into question the longer this lasts. The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it’s happening. A good way to do that is to   predictions from smart economists. In January 2005, as it does every year, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast for the United States’ budget and economic outlook over the decade to come. If the C. B. O. ’s projections had come true, the United States would have had $3. 1 trillion more economic output in 2015 than it actually did  —   17 percent more. Even if the steep contraction of   hadn’t happened, the shortfall would have been $1. 7 trillion. As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy’s underperformance. In 2000, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, published a paper titled “Does the ‘New Economy’ Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past?” It argued that the internet would not have the same transformative impact on how much economic output would emerge from an hour of human labor as   innovations like electricity, air transport and indoor plumbing did. It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. “People said: ‘Productivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You’re wrong we’re in a new age,’ ” Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, “people started to take my point of view more and more seriously. ” He offers the example of the    computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a   bump than a continuing trend. Douglas   director of the C. B. O. at the time of the 2005 forecast and now president of the American Action Forum, said technology “just seems to be less special and more comparable to other forms of investments than it had seemed. ” The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent. But it’s not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago. The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C. B. O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5. 2 percent it was 4. 9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force  —   neither working nor looking  —   in 2015 than projected. An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection) and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious “residual”: younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate. Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the “supply” side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too. Think of the economy as a car if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it’s capable of, a car won’t go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntary exit of people from the labor force and    gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation. That’s not what’s happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all. The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the   problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force. But what if it’s both? Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates. In November 2013, he combined those observations into a   speech at an I. M. F. conference arguing that the global economy had, just maybe, settled into a state of “secular stagnation” in which there was insufficient demand, and resulting slow growth, low inflation and low interest rates. While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years. But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don’t think there will be demand for their products. Mr. Summers, in an interview, frames it as an inversion of “Say’s Law,” the notion that supply creates its own demand: that economywide, people doing the work to create goods and services results in their having the income to then buy those goods and services. In this case, rather, as he has often put it: “Lack of demand creates lack of supply. ” His proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply  —   helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump. Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the   economic rival of the United States. In other words, there’s a lot we don’t know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn’t change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.",0,1603,17.0531914893617,94,0.3287585776668746,0,0,0,0,91.75759736208893,38.681774557320416,46.00748596381784,27.84610106051154,0.8502807236431691,0.023705552089831567,0.06862133499688085,0.034310667498440424,0.032439176543980035,0.0056144728633811605,0.15159076731129134,0.0031191515907673115,0.0006238303181534623,0.015595757953836557,0.09794135995009358,0,0.08671241422333126,0.004366812227074236,0.0006238303181534623,0.03056768558951965,0.008733624454148471,0.12538989394884592,0.004990642545227698,0.047411104179663134,0.050530255770430445,0.0630068621334997,0,0.0012476606363069245,0.042420461634435434,0.021210230817217717,0.07610729881472239,0,0.0006238303181534623,0.0006238303181534623,0,0,0.011852776044915784,0.034934497816593885,0,0,0.4741110417966313,0.0031191515907673115,0.0037429819089207735,0.002495321272613849,0.0012476606363069245,0.049906425452276984,0.004366812227074236,0,0.015595757953836557,0.011228945726762321,0,0.004990642545227698,0.031815346225826574,0.03056768558951965,0.011228945726762321,0.015595757953836557,0.0037429819089207735,0.0006238303181534623,0.034934497816593885,0.2719900187149095,0.008733624454148471,0.0018714909544603868,0.015595757953836557,0.059263880224578916,0.07548346849656894,0.014971927635683094,0.01684341859014348,0.043044291952588895,0.1472239550842171,0.06487835308796007,0.041172800998128506,0.0012476606363069245,0.012476606363069246,0.15782907049282596,0,0.009357454772301934,0.0056144728633811605,0.006238303181534623,0.008733624454148471,0,0,0.0031191515907673115,0.039925140361821584,0.08172177167810356,0,0.03056768558951965,0.0056144728633811605,0.053025577043044295,0.12164691203992514,0.132252027448534,0.0018714909544603868,0.06550218340611354,0.0031191515907673115,83.725,0,52.65,1,9,29,15,26.125,27.475,87.38499999999999,20,21,5.975,0,83.725,0,150.29999999999998,44,173.525,356.82500000000005,150.29999999999998,,0.6588163882756387,0,0.5483862785659805,0.022543356454155186,0.17189032851374006,0.4007796309368338,0.25702991036879996,0.37598601823799765,0.38787888424148664,0.6683673606814065,0.3156617132075351,0.3262948591553228,0.12111330976008795,0,0.5203333991951948,0,0.08195983804343379,0.02399356536201655,0.09462462339645276,0.194579635461399,-0.4310151291257288,0.805420364538601,126
392,"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The Turkish authorities are hunting for the gunman who opened fire at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Day, killing at least 39 people from no fewer than 12 countries. The Islamic State claimed him as “a hero soldier of the caliphate” and appeared to refer to Turkey’s role in the Syrian war. In Iraq, the group claimed a suicide bombing in central Baghdad that killed dozens, even as it makes a brutal   effort to hang on to its only remaining Iraqi stronghold, Mosul. _____ • South Korea’s full Constitutional Court begins formal hearings on the impeachment of President Park  . Public outrage  —   initially aimed at influence by Choi   the daughter of a religious sect leader  —   has turned to broader concerns about the power of the presidency and the influence of   conglomerates like Samsung. The country is seeking the extradition of Ms. Choi’s daughter, who was arrested in Denmark after months of hiding. _____ • House Republicans surprised Washington by voting to hobble a congressional ethics office with no advance notice. The full House will consider the move today as the most powerful   Congress in 20 years goes into session, promising to roll back many of President Obama’s signature policies. Faced with North Korea’s threat to test an intercontinental ballistic missile,   Donald J. Trump took to Twitter to declare bluntly, “It won’t happen!” Over the weekend, Mr. Trump promised to reveal “things that other people don’t know,” possibly as soon as today, about assessments that Russia interfered in the U. S. election. _____ • “We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ” Many Indians agree with that sentiment, voiced by a Delhi taxi driver, saying they are more concerned about reining in corruption than the immediate hardships caused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ban on   bills. India’s Supreme Court ruled that candidates for political office may not run on   or   appeals. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections that will test the strength of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. _____ • SpaceX traced the explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket in September to the unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The company said it would resume launches as early as Sunday. • American tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook are on a collision course with European regulators over issues including privacy and taxes. •   saunas, or jjimjilbangs, are doing a brisk business in parts of the United States. • Ads from a slew of major U. S. companies prominently feature Muslims as part of an inclusive marketing strategy. • Thinking about asking for a raise, or changing jobs? Or just want to be happier at work? Here’s a roundup of advice on retuning your career. • Most major markets reopen after the New Year’s holiday.

Sometimes, they’re just taken with a subject, like Myanmar’s unemployed elephants or President Xi Jinping’s favorite jacket. Here are some of our favorites. Enjoy. “I Can’t Drive 55,” the rocker Sammy Hagar once famously wailed, but 43 years ago this week, he and every other American driver were faced with obeying the first federal speed limit. Setting speed limits had been the states’ responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That’s the fastest in the country, though it’s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany’s autobahn have no maximum limit. It’s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour.

394,"LOS ANGELES  —   The entire Hollywood press corps turned up. So did dozens of Chinese executives from the   Dalian Wanda Group, some of whom were introduced as “special dignitaries. ” Studio executives? Check. Leaders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Grinning from the front row. But why were there also four women in gold evening gowns serving as ushers and M. C.’s? And why was the “Star Wars” score used as part of the Monday affair, which was held to promote Wanda’s $5 billion studio complex in Qingdao as a home away from home for Hollywood? The answer seemed to be: because Wanda wanted it that way. And, at least for eager Hollywood executives hoping to tap into the   Chinese box office, that was answer enough. As the Motion Picture Association of America’s chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, said in a video infomercial for the Qingdao complex that played as part of the event, “Any time an audience grows, everyone benefits. ” The 5 p. m. presentation, held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began with remarks by Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the academy, an institution dedicated in part to celebrating artistic freedom. “We have so much in common,” Ms. Boone Isaacs said of the Chinese and American film industries. “Art. Creativity. Conscience. Conviction. Just telling your story. ” Hollywood, of course, has been frustrated that Chinese censors restrict the flow of American films into China only a few dozen foreign films are allowed to be exhibited annually. But Ms. Boone Isaacs kept it gauzy. “This art form, like an   carousel, is at its best when it takes us around the world,” she said of cinema. Next up: Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made bolstering the movie industry a priority of his administration. Specifically, he has criticized the practice of studios moving production to other states and countries to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates. That, of course, is exactly the kind of runaway production funding that Wanda announced at Monday’s event. Mr. Garcetti tried to have it both ways. After noting that efforts to bring back production have borne fruit, he said, “We also are not a place that closes in. ” He added, “We will be strong about promoting Los Angeles as a place to film, but we will also be proud to make those international links that are core to our businesses growing. ” With that, Mr. Garcetti introduced Wang Jianlin, Wanda’s chairman. For his part, Mr. Wang spent most of his speech (delivered in Mandarin, with translation provided to the audience via headphones) highlighting the spectacular growth of the Chinese box office. Within a decade, he noted, China will not only far surpass the United States as a movie marketplace, it will control more than 40 percent of global ticket sales. He got a round of applause when he said that American studios needed to “improve the quality” of their movies. “In the recent few years, perhaps because Hollywood movies are trying to minimize their risk, there are less original movies,” he said. After criticizing Hollywood’s   on special effects, he added, “Now that Chinese audiences are smarter, they do not so easily become happy. ” It was almost a wrap. But first came more details about the 40 percent rebate Wanda will offer studios for filming at its    “movie metropolis” in Qingdao. Invited to the stage were executives from studios that had already signed up, including Lionsgate,   Legendary Entertainment, Arclight Films and Kylin Pictures. As one of the women in gold gowns said in closing, “It’s very exciting!”",0,603,14.707317073170731,41,0.33001658374792703,0,0,0,0,91.94787964937218,6.9201181154704665,75.18542703150912,75.08436981757878,0.7960199004975125,0.026533996683250415,0.06135986733001658,0.04145936981757877,0.04311774461028192,0.014925373134328358,0.21393034825870647,0.006633499170812604,0.001658374792703151,0.011608623548922056,0.07131011608623548,0,0.05970149253731343,0.001658374792703151,0,0.02321724709784411,0.006633499170812604,0.07296849087893864,0.003316749585406302,0.07296849087893864,0.03482587064676617,0.05140961857379768,0,0.001658374792703151,0.014925373134328358,0.004975124378109453,0.09286898839137644,0.001658374792703151,0,0.003316749585406302,0.008291873963515755,0,0.009950248756218905,0.05970149253731343,0,0,0.4361525704809287,0,0.014925373134328358,0.013266998341625208,0,0.04809286898839138,0,0.001658374792703151,0.013266998341625208,0.011608623548922056,0.03814262023217247,0.02321724709784411,0.013266998341625208,0.01990049751243781,0.004975124378109453,0.008291873963515755,0,0,0.01658374792703151,0.22553897180762852,0.003316749585406302,0.001658374792703151,0.026533996683250415,0.06965174129353234,0.11608623548922056,0.03648424543946932,0.03482587064676617,0.03980099502487562,0.15754560530679934,0.0845771144278607,0.03482587064676617,0.006633499170812604,0.04311774461028192,0.11774461028192372,0,0.02321724709784411,0.001658374792703151,0,0.008291873963515755,0,0,0.01990049751243781,0.07628524046434494,0.06467661691542288,0,0.014925373134328358,0.004975124378109453,0.03316749585406302,0.11608623548922056,0.1111111111111111,0.009950248756218905,0.06467661691542288,0.001658374792703151,47.6,0,24,1,4,0,8,6,25.535,14.9,13,21,19,0,47.6,0,122.13499999999999,8,29.9,160.035,122.13499999999999,,0.6243798657979825,0,0.45596479933305306,0.03374315277967364,0.12256538371419255,0,0.21836658334976405,0.17323195505014824,0.4713807885154008,0.3422483113189774,0.3122324848620356,0.42308307297521586,0.3988610030599159,0,0,0,0.1686865966424275,0.011049189610999469,0.04129634617111051,0.22103213242453748,0.8199872468385904,0.7789678675754625,39
395,"by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente . Dallas readers: Yves writes to say her plane is getting in early, and so, there having been no untoward events, the Meetup will be held as scheduled! TPP, TTIP, TISA CETA: A week of pressure from four Belgian regions opposed to CETA, led by the courageous Walloons, produced a revised “joint interpretive instrument” and, importantly, a new list of conditions that must be met before Belgium can ratify the deal” [ Rabble.ca ]. “Unfortunately, the joint interpretive ‘instrument’ is mostly artful deception. To take just one example, the instrument’s affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. ‘The critical point missing,’ as we wrote previously, ‘is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'” So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! Wallonia’s principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium’s federal government to sign CETA. For example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA’s investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium’s regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. This means that CETA’s investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA’s provisional application in all European member states. The German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany’s second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. So while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA’s full ratification even less likely. CETA’s passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. And then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment– CETA: “CETA puts Canada’s trade debate to rest once and for all” [ Globe and Mail ]. “The rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country’s trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.” CETA: “What the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade” [ Fortune ]. “All of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement… Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.” TISA: “The 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows — where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position — and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners. The round is scheduled to last through Nov. 10” [ Politico ]. 2016 Days until: 5. That’s not very many days! Debates “Presidential Candidates Dr. Jill Stein & Gov. Gary Johnson [Pt. 1]” [ Tavis Smiley ]. A forum-style “conversation” between the two. “‘I had a team of people who were relentless, totally in the head of what Trump might do,’ [Hillary Clinton] says” [ People ] “‘A lot of this comes down to who gets into whose head. It’s like an athletic contest or maybe a high-stakes entertainment performance.” War Drums “In the five and a half years since the uprising in Syria began, it has become the most catastrophic war of our young century” [Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker ]. I would have thought that our invasion of Iraq in 2003 set the baseline for “catastrophic”? What the heck was Filkins thinking when he wrote that sentence? And The New Yorker used to be famous for its fact-checking. When did that get crapified, anyhow? The Voters “[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There’s something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats” [ The Baffer ]. “When our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It’s messy ‘maintaining’ history, after all.” “Early Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results” [ RealClearPolitics ]. One of several reasons: “[W]e don’t know the effect to which campaign strategy is creating the appearance of a participation surge by merely cannibalizing Election Day voters by mobilizing voters who would have voted on Election Day anyway.” Downballot “The presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats” [ Cook Political Report ]. ” Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news… Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.” Well done, DSCC: For Senate this year, Dems nominated two weed opponents (NV, NH), corp lobbyists (PA, IN), & a trust fund kid former Republican (FL) &mdash; Lee Fang (@lhfang) November 2, 2016 The Trail “SEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia” [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? “[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that’s down 5 points from its peak last week” [ ABC ]. ” Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.” Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it’s madness to focus on individual polls; RCP’s 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. “With the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to “come home'” [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump’s attention somehow. Or Ivanka. “Donald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out” [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ]. Four paragraphs in, he turns to the topic of Trump: “Trump is not only a flawed politician, he’s an indecent human being.” Persuasive! I dunno. If a vote for Trump would finally force Friedman off the Times Op-Ed page, would it be worth it? Tough call. Realignment “Will this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?” [ McClatchy ]. “Just days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party. Democrats over that same time increased 2.7 percent and Republicans 3.6 percent…” “6 Reasons Why A New Civil War Is Possible And Terrifying” [ Cracked ]. “‘Trust’ isn’t just an intangible concept when we’re talking about the potential for civil warfare. Sinisa Malesevic is a professor who studies the sociology of civil wars and a survivor of the Yugoslavian civil war. He’s someone Marvel really should’ve reached out to for script advice, and he noted the breakdown of trust was one of the first traumatizing steps to war, ‘… in a very short period of time, there is a complete sense of fear, you do not know who is who, who is supporting which side … that fear spreads.'” And: “Colonel Couvillon also thought any conflict was likely to start in a rural area, ‘…people talk about, is it gonna be class warfare, race warfare … is it gonna be north versus south? Personally, I think it’s gonna be urban versus rural.'” Another interesting piece from Cracked, of all places. Democrat Email Hairball “Opinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins” [ MarketWatch ]. “[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton’s lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump’s claim that this scandal is “worse than Watergate” could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.” “U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton’s actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president” [ Beloit Daily News ]. “Johnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records ‘shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.’‘I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,’ Johnson said. ‘I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'” In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term “public records” becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn’t simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that’s exactly what she did with “her”— that is, the public’s — mail. “Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a ‘constitutional crisis’ if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, ‘I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I’m speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him” [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn’s post today . Stats Watch ADP Employment Report, October 2016: “ADP sees significant softening for Friday’s employment report, estimating October private payrolls will come in at 147,000” [ Econoday ]. “Though ADP’s revision does point to an upward revision to September’s data in Friday’s report, the October estimate is soft and could further lower expectations for a rate hike at today’s FOMC meeting.” And but: ” ADP is showing jobs growth equalling the rate of people entering the jobs market. The growth this month is as Econintersect forecasted based on economic potential” [ Econintersect ]. “ADP employment has not been a good predictor of BLS non-farm private job growth. Gallup U.S. Job Creation Index, October 2016: “American workers’ reports of hiring activity at their place of employment remained relatively strong in October, with many more saying their employer was adding rather than subtracting jobs” [ Econoday ]. “For nearly all of Gallup’s JCI trend since August 2008, net hiring in the private sector has far outpaced government net hiring. But the latest poll shows the narrowest gap between net hiring in the two sectors since April 2009, with nongovernment hiring (plus 32) essentially tied with government hiring (plus 31).” MBA Mortgage Applications, week of October 28, 2016: “Purchase applications for home mortgages fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in the October 28 week, following a sharp 7 percent decline in the prior week to the lowest level since January” [ Econoday ]. Shipping: “US west coast employers and [ILWU and PMA] union leaders are to continue talks about extending the current employment contract covering dockworkers.The two sides met on Tuesday to discuss an extension beyond mid-2019 as part of an effort to restore confidence in ports along the Pacific seaboard” [ Lloyd’s List ]. Shipping: “Are conditions finally improving for the air cargo industry?” [ Air Cargo News ]. “September market round-up shows that air cargo volume demand increased by 5% year on year in September — a level of increase not seen for two years. ‘With such an increase in total weight transported, a further worldwide yield improvement over previous months, and industry sources claiming that October will be even better, one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry shows signs of improving health,’ the analyst said.” There’s a calendar effect that only accounts for a fraction of the increase. “At the recent Air Cargo Forum there was much speculation as to what had caused the improvements.” A sporty game! Shipping: “A majority of Splash readers fear container freight rates will only pick up later than 2020. With 10 days to go until voting closes in our quarterly online survey, called MarPoll, roughly one quarter of the more than 500 respondents to date feel container freight rates will pick up only after 2020” [ Splash 24/7 ]. “‘Shipping may have to accept the bubble has burst and what was will not be again. There is a new normal and companies need to plan as such,’ one respondent noted” Shipping: “[The Boston Consulting Group Inc.] said shipping capacity will outstrip demand by between 8.2% and 13.8% in 2020, compared with a 7% gap today. If borne out, that forecast would indicate this year’s plunging freight rates and shrinking profits for marine carriers will only grow worse, particularly on major trade lanes across the Pacific and between Asia and Europe” [ Wall Street Journal , “More Pain Ahead for Ocean Shipping”]. “The shipping industry hasn’t adjusted to a slowdown in global trade, with shipyards churning out giant container vessels and carriers holding onto excess capacity even as rates fall. Historically, container shipping demand grew over 5% annually, often outpacing global economic growth. Between 2015 and 2020, BCG estimates container demand will rise between 2.2% and 3.8% annually.” And we’re still building out warehouses… Shipping: “Cummins shipped just 16,400 engines in North America in the quarter, down 33% from a year ago. That’s in line with a downturn in orders for big rigs that’s triggered layoffs among truck makers and led Cummins to cut its spending on research and engineering more than 14% in the first nine months of the year” [ Wall Street Journal ]. Shipping: “Shipping finally emerging from 2009 downturn, Mitropoulos argues” [ Lloyd’s List ]. “Signs are finally materialising that the industry is emerging from its protracted downturn, according to a former secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization.Efthimios Mitropoulos was speaking on Tuesday morning at the Shipping and the Law Conference in Naples.” Great courage! Honey for the Bears: “Most of the leading indicators are based on factors which are known to have significant backward revisions – and one cannot take any of their trends to the bank. I continue to pose the question: “[W]hat good is a leading indicator where the data is continued to change after it is issued?'” [ Econintersect ]. “The only indicators with minimal backward revision are ECRI, RecessionALERT, and the Chemical Activity Barometer. Unfortunately, the Chemical Activity Barometer is targeted to the industrial sector of the economy – and at best seems to be a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator. Both ECRI and RecessionALERT were forecasting economic improvement beginning at mid-2016 – and is now forecasting flat (but relatively better) growth beginning 5 months from now. Econintersect sees NO dynamic which will deliver better growth anyone will feel in the foreseeable future. All economic growth will only be seen when one uses a calculator.” Infrastructure: “A pipeline explosion in Alabama is roiling U.S. fuel markets and putting a spotlight on tight domestic shipping capacity. The major Colonial pipeline fuel artery was severed for the second time in two months this week” [ Wall Street Journal ]. Fodder for the Bulls: “Update: The Endless Parade of Recession Calls” [ Calculated Risk ]. “Looking at the economic data, the odds of a recession in 2016 are very low (extremely unlikely in my view).

Someday I’ll make another recession call, but I’m not even on recession watch now.” Fodder for the Bulls: “Eurozone factories had their most active month for almost three years in October, and raised their prices for the first time in more than a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers released Wednesday” [ Wall Street Journal , “Eurozone Factory Survey Shows Expansion”].

Police State Watch “Raided but never charged, cannabis distributor seeks return of seized assets” [ San Diego Tribune (RF)]. “‘It’s the dirty little secret of the American justice system,’ [James] Slatic said in an interview. ‘They can come in and take all your money and property just on the say-so of a police officer. Once they do that, you have to go to court and prove why your money is not guilty.'” (Obama made noises about ending asset forfeiture, but resumed it . Of course, asset forfeiture will be a lot easier when digital cash arrives! Standing Rock and #NoDAPL “I used to think there was no rational argument for civilian possession of military-style weapons. But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it’s apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester’s toolkit” [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn’t that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama’s DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the “wrong” color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework). “Want to Help the Standing Rock Sioux? Here’s Where to Donate” [ Money (!!)]. “A GoFundMe set up by protester Ho Waste Wakiya Wicasa has raised more than $1 million, which will be used for the camp’s operating expenses. “The money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn’t have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,” Wicasa told Fox News. The funds raised have been used for groceries, yurts, toilets, a medical area, a generator, and bail for those arrested.” “After 37 Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers left for the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota Saturday, a majority of Cincinnati City Council issued a letter to Gov. John Kasich requesting the troopers be brought home” [ USA Today ]. “The signers said the trooper should come home so they can focus on Ohio issues, naming the heroin epidemic and increased traffic fatalities.” Tough choice. After all, the troopers could use the practice. Black Injustice Tipping Point “Net worth of white households in D.C. region is 81 times that of black households” [ WaPo ]. “The Urban Institute report, called “The Color of Wealth in the Nation’s Capital,” said the Great Recession and housing crisis of 2007 to 2009 exacerbated long-persistent disparities, with black and Hispanic households losing about half of their wealth.” Class Warfare “Data can help hotel executives manage workforce” [ Hotel News Notes ]. “Performance evaluations are another area where big data can play an important role. Instead of the usual, subjective assessments by supervisors, employees can be judged through company-tracked data, which may measure:” Punctuality; results of client/manager surveys; tracking of output keyed directly to the percentage of time and input of all contributing workers; and non-health related biometric data or other feedback associated with wearable technology, such as how employees traverse during the workday. This creates a more objective review process – reducing bias and the threat of lawsuits – and takes pressure off supervisors. That little point on wearables seems a little Orwellian. They won’t be able to force me to wear my wearable at all times , right? “The east sides of New York, London and Paris are noticeably and famously poorer than their western sides. And it turns out there’s a reason for that” [ MarketWatch ]. “Researchers have found that it’s due to the impact of air pollutants at the time of the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds in the U.S. and Europe typically blow from west to east. And it’s an impact that has lasted into today” ( original study ). “Twenty-First Century Victorians” [ Jacobin ]. “Today’s upper middle class maintains the fiction of a meritocratic society, just as the Victorians did. This story allows them to shore up their economic position behind the backs of workers, who are taught that their health problems and dismal career prospects represent individual faults, not systemic dysfunction. Of course, exercising, eating organic food, and pushing children to use their spare time usefully are not inherently bad things. However, they become markers of bourgeois values when they are marshaled to assert one class’s moral superiority over another and to justify social inequality. It was just as obnoxious in the nineteenth century as it is today.” UPDATE “Behind 2016’s Turmoil, a Crisis of White Identity” [Amanda Taub, New York Times ] “Whiteness, in this context, is more than just skin color. You could define it as membership in the ‘ethno-national majority,’ but that’s a mouthful. What it really means is the privilege of not being defined as ‘other.’ Whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance, traditions, religion and even food are the default norm. It’s being a person who, by unspoken rules, was long entitled as part of ‘us’ instead of ‘them.'” Peak identity politics?

396,"Breakdown of the Clinton Money Machine November 12, 2016 As troubling as Donald Trump’s election may be, it carries greater hope for some positive good than the alternative of Hillary Clinton, who represented a corrupt, money-churning machine, writes John Chuckman. By John Chuckman Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations, which deserve attention and which unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons (and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment and progressivity). The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American oligarch, a self-proclaimed billionaire, a man with a lifetime’s economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ever-flowing with money for their ambitions. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo) It was the ever-flowing well of money, drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends, such as Jeffrey Epstein, that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party. It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship – although Bill, in his heyday, displayed some of both of those – that earned the Clintons their place, it was the money, the “mother’s milk of politics.” In what is euphemistically called “fund raising,” many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clinton’s efforts. Hillary Clinton fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence. She lacked Bill’s superficial charm, but she certainly more than shared his ambition. On the charm front, when she was ready to move into running for office, she adopted, perhaps under Bill’s tutelage, a kind of forced set of expressions with arched eyebrows, bugged-out eyes, and a smile as big as her lips would allow. These expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helter-skelter whenever she campaigned. Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant. These were not natural for her. They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife, both in a governor’s mansion and later in the White House, bizarre because she indulged her husband’s non-stop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politician-husband. Money Talks Anyway, Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics. She determined to build a political war chest long ago, and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view, as when running for the Senate, when sources of big money suggested another view would be more acceptable. She was anything but constant in the views that she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money, embarrassingly large amounts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30, 2012. [State Department photo] In her years of speaking engagements, she aimed at special interests that could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees. Later, in the influential, appointed post of Secretary of State – coming, as it does, into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed, big-time international schemer – she unquestionably played an aggressive “pay for play” with them all. It appears that covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about.A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading. The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time. It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks, hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like “family values,” public prayer in schools and catering to the Christian Right – along with anti-flag burning Constitutional amendments — and now it is truly out of gas. The Republican Party had been given a breather, some new life, by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He had an extremely mixed record as President, but he was popular, held in some affection, and did have a clear vision, but his effect on the party was not lasting. Trump could be seen as another Reagan, but I think the comparison is superficial. Trump literally hijacked the party. He was not deliriously crowned by its establishment. The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors, including the Whigs and Free-Soil Democrats. Parties do not last forever, and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party, a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed. In the Republican primaries, he was opposed by tired, boring men like Jeb Bush, seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency, and a dark, intensely unlikable, phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz, and it proved to be no contest. Trump’s capture of the GOP nomination was a remarkable political achievement, but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party. The press was too busy attacking Trump from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis, and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the Establishment that he represented. His most promising quality was his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the Neocon Wars that Hillary Clinton embraced and promised to expand. A Democratic Party in Trouble But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble, too. It has a great deal of internal rot, as the WikiLeaks material from the Democratic National Committee clearly shows us. Arrogance, lack of direction, ignorance of the people whom the party has always claimed to serve, bad decision-making, and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN. It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot. She has always had strong negatives in polling, always been (rightly) suspected concerning her honesty. The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts, including harsh high-level judgments of Hillary’s decision-making, resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes, and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run. And, frankly, Hillary Clinton had become for many a rather tiresome, used-up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected. But they not only blindly supported her, they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender, Bernie Sanders. Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats, but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out-of-hand. After all, there were Bill and Hillary beckoning toward their running well of money. In hindsight, it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination. He proved a weak individual in the end, giving in to just the forces that he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down. There he was, out on the hustings, supporting everything he ever opposed as personified in Hillary Clinton. Men of that nature do not stand up well to Generals and Admirals and the heads of massive corporations, a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display. Public Distrust Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat. The numbers are unmistakable. Yes, Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure, but Hillary simply did badly, not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states, again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a well-liked figure and the Party blundered badly in running her. President-elect Donald Trump But again, money talks, and the Clintons, particularly Bill, are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime. No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money. Now, to many Americans, the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution, although a revolution conducted through ballots, any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military-security state. In a way, it does represent something of a revolutionary event, owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views. And, as in any revolution, even a small one, there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes. The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come. Lyndon Johnson, life-long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War, did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president. Franklin Roosevelt, son of wealthy establishment figures, provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression, restoring hopes and dreams for millions. Change, important, change, never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties. It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality. I have some limited but important hopes for Trump. I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person, and after the experience of Barack Obama, who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing, bloody disappointment, I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician. And what was the choice anyway? Hillary Clinton was a bought-and-paid one-way ticket to hell. Trump offers two areas of some hope, and these both represent real change. The first is in reducing America’s close to out-of-control military aggressiveness abroad. This aggressiveness, reflecting momentum from what can only be called the Cheney-Rumsfeld Presidency, continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as Secretary of State. Hillary did a lot of killing during her tenure inside the federal government, advocating and promoting military interventions as First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. She along with Obama is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of men, women and children, many of them literally torn apart by bombs. Welfare of Americans The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary Americans who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades. George W. Bush’s lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina (before he was internationally shamed into some action) has become the normal pattern for America’s national government when it comes to ordinary Americans. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a press conference. Inside the Democratic Party, the truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role, and of course never did in the Republican Party. By welfare, I do not mean the kind of state assistance to the poor that Bill Clinton himself worked to end. Nothing can impress someone not familiar with America’s dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicago’s South Side, parts of New Orleans, or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes. No, I mean the people’s general well-being. Trump’s approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs. I don’t know whether he can succeed, but, just as he asked people in some of his speeches, “What do you have to lose?” Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the “deplorables” is a small gain. People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive, and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary. His record as President – apart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs – was actually pretty appalling. In his own words, he “ended welfare as we know it.” He signed legislation that would send large numbers of young black men to prison. He also signed legislation that contributed to the country’s later financial collapse under George W. Bush. He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off, leaving them dangling, when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming. His FBI conducted the assault on Waco, killing about 80 people needlessly. A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason. There were a number of scandals that were never fully explained to the public. It was his Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who answered, unblinkingly, a television interviewer’s question about a half million Iraqi children who died owing to America’s embargo, “We think the price is worth it.” He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade, including the intentional destruction of the Serb TV building. When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government, the order secretly went out to shut up about it. No effort was made to intervene in that case. No, any real change in America could never come from people like the Clintons, either one of them.

398,"LOS ANGELES  —   Foreign governments concerned about climate change may soon be spending more time dealing with Sacramento than Washington.   Donald J. Trump has packed his cabinet with nominees who dispute the science of global warming. He has signaled he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. He has belittled the notion of global warming and attacked policies intended to combat it. But California  —   a state that has for 50 years been a leader in environmental advocacy  —   is about to step unto the breach. In a show of defiance, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and legislative leaders said they would work directly with other nations and states to defend and strengthen what were already far and away the most aggressive policies to fight climate change in the nation. That includes a legislatively mandated target of reducing carbon emissions in California to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. “California can make a significant contribution to advancing the cause of dealing with climate change, irrespective of what goes on in Washington,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “I wouldn’t underestimate California’s resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction. Yes, we will take action. ” The prospect of California’s elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California’s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state’s vast research community  —   including two national laboratories  —   which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. “They could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,” said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. “That would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones. ” And some business leaders warned that California’s embrace of environmental regulations  —   from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors  —   could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. “If the other states pursue    policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,” said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills “impose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone’s daily lives or the fact that California’s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,” the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2. 5 trillion. “California more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,” said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. “We will not deviate from our leadership because of one election. ” The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. “This is not something that’s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,” said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science. ” Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the   industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state’s energy and climate initiatives. “But they would be fighting a very uphill battle,” she said. “Politically, it’s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down. ” California’s economy is powered by a   industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative, backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries  —   more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion  —   that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. California’s    program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on    policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. The   initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very   policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California’s economic reversal. “If the   and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,” Mr. de Leon said. “They will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G. D. P. ” Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. “Our system works better  —   our    system and other ways of addressing climate change  —   if we have more company,” said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. “The more company we have, the better. ” Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can “keep doing what we are doing, leading the way. ” “But will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that’s why it’s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,” he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an   environmental movement. “We’ve got the lawyers and we’ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,” Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. “We’re ready to win. ” Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump’s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. “In a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,” he said. “The shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world. ”",0,1450,19.863013698630137,73,0.3620689655172414,0,0,0,0,94.17022441160373,11.939213085764813,73.71609195402299,17.721485411140584,0.7862068965517242,0.02620689655172414,0.04551724137931035,0.02689655172413793,0.04689655172413793,0.02,0.16,0.010344827586206896,0.0020689655172413794,0.013793103448275862,0.08758620689655172,0.000689655172413793,0.0696551724137931,0.002758620689655172,0,0.02413793103448276,0.006896551724137931,0.08689655172413793,0.001379310344827586,0.04827586206896552,0.023448275862068966,0.04758620689655172,0,0.000689655172413793,0.02620689655172414,0.015172413793103448,0.11586206896551725,0,0,0.005517241379310344,0.001379310344827586,0,0.02,0.027586206896551724,0.000689655172413793,0.000689655172413793,0.44,0.0020689655172413794,0.013793103448275862,0.002758620689655172,0.000689655172413793,0.04068965517241379,0.001379310344827586,0.000689655172413793,0.006896551724137931,0.008275862068965517,0.000689655172413793,0.015862068965517243,0.013793103448275862,0.025517241379310347,0.006206896551724138,0.025517241379310347,0,0.000689655172413793,0.02620689655172414,0.20689655172413793,0.00896551724137931,0,0.025517241379310347,0.05655172413793103,0.09034482758620689,0.031724137931034485,0.02,0.07103448275862069,0.14551724137931035,0.07241379310344828,0.019310344827586208,0.000689655172413793,0.030344827586206897,0.13034482758620689,0,0.00896551724137931,0.007586206896551724,0.0034482758620689655,0.006206896551724138,0,0,0.009655172413793104,0.08206896551724138,0.07655172413793103,0,0.018620689655172412,0.006896551724137931,0.032413793103448274,0.11103448275862068,0.11655172413793104,0.014482758620689656,0.08137931034482758,0,46,0,102.35,0,8.3,0,4,26,52.85,54,13.6,32,29.5,24,46,10,152.95,16,215.85,377.32500000000005,152.95,,0.5462537621068024,0,0.7281590713318157,0,0.17845645182437803,0,0.09476439431879669,0.40492169014824697,0.5803869002667241,0.5856201216685286,0.26249785916329227,0.4557758788319707,0.43568192844090753,0.38579039861770864,0.5051162686174031,0.20742607609621766,0.08921878873609146,0.009333119449345952,0.12590961457133273,0.22010120601402886,-0.6995222505409504,0.7798987939859712,113

400,"Fifth Varshavyanka submarine joins Russia’s Navy 26 October 2016 TASS By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. Facebook submarines , russian navy , black sea fleet The fifth non-nuclear submarine of project 636.3, The Veliki Novgorod, has joined the Russian Navy, a TASS correspondent reports from the flag-hoisting ceremony at the Admiralty Shipyards in St. Petersburg, attended by the Russian Navy’s Deputy commander, Vice-Admiral Alexander Fedotenkov and the shipyards’ CEO Alexander Buzakov. ""The Veliki Novgorod submarine has been through all government certification tests. All of the previous submarines in that series built for the Black Sea Fleet have confirmed the expected parameters, too,"" Buzakov said. The Veliki Novgorod is the fifth in the group of six submarines of project 636.3 (Varshavyanka) built for the Black Sea Fleet. The first two - The Novorossiysk and The Rostov-on-Don were delivered in 2014, and another two, The Stary Oskol and The Krasnodar, in 2015. By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. The flag-hoisting ceremony is due November 25. Another six Varshavyanka subs will be built at the Admiralty shipyards for the Pacific Fleet. The contract was signed at the Army-2016 forum near Moscow. The last submarine in the second group is to be delivered in 2021. First published by TASS .

401,"It may not qualify as a   eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G. E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight  —   but to what end? That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G. E. couldn’t make use of it. “We had to be more capable in software,” Mr. Immelt said he decided. Maybe G. E.  —   a maker of power turbines, jet engines, locomotives and   equipment  —   needed to think of its competitors as Amazon and IBM. Back then, G. E. was returning to its   roots and navigating the global financial crisis, shedding much of its bloated finance arm, GE Capital. That winnowing went on for years as billions of dollars in assets were sold, passing a milestone this summer when GE Capital was removed from the government’s short list of financial institutions deemed “too big to fail. ” But in 2011, G. E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif. 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay. Today one of San Ramon’s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale  —   a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G. E.’s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a “top 10 software company” by 2020. Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical. “G. E. is trying to do this the way a big company does, by throwing thousands of people and billions of dollars at it,” said Thomas M. Siebel, a technology entrepreneur who is now chief executive of C3 IoT, a   that has done work for G. E. “But they’re not software people. ” The San Ramon complex, home to GE Digital, now employs 1, 400 people. The buildings are designed to suit the   working ways of software developers:   floors, bench seating, whiteboards, couches for impromptu meetings, balconies overlooking the grounds and kitchen areas with snacks. Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G. E. a    company and the nation’s largest manufacturer, with more than 300, 000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and   habits of Silicon Valley to G. E.’s world of industrial manufacturing. G. E.’s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it “probably the most important thing I’ve worked on in my career. ” Apparently, there is no Plan B. “It’s this or bust,” he said. The march of digital technology  —   mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software  —   into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of “the internet of things” or “the industrial internet. ” It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines. It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G. E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts. So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down. The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G. E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G. E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but “business outcomes,” like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain. Yet all of this exposes G. E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of  . There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn’t changed much in generations. “The real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,” said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “G. E. has no choice but to try to do that itself. ” Recently, G. E. has lured software engineers and data scientists from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Early on, though, it struggled simply to hire. Last year it began running   television ads, featuring young hires, aimed at closing the company’s image gap of industrial giant but digital midget. (Applications at GE Digital jumped eightfold, the company says.) Until this year, Darren Haas hadn’t thought about G. E. certainly not working there. To him, G. E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. “I had no idea,” Mr. Haas said. But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of   software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G. E. and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital. That someone of Mr. Kodesh’s caliber was a G. E. convert got Mr. Haas’s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G. E. equipment plays across the economy  —   in transportation, in hospitals  —   “a whole world,” he said. “I found that really, really compelling. ” The other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G. E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the   digital assistant   Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud. At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology  —   machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing  —   to the industrial arena. “I’ve got my work cut out for me,” he said. Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G. E.’s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G. E.’s software ambitions. Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G. E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G. E. industrial businesses. But that soon felt too small. The issue was “outside disrupters,” Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging   Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that “bring greater productivity  —   but don’t own the assets they sell. ” G. E. Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate   company. The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G. E. reimagined Predix as a   operating system for industrial applications. Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. “Those companies are going to encroach on the territory,” Mr. Kodesh said. “Are we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?” The basic idea is that G. E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and   the operation of equipment like   rigs and   turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines. Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G. E. is following an   model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors  —   more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft. Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. “Some will be G. E.’s, and some will be made by   developers,” he said. G. E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high. For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software  —   “a false positive”  —   might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100, 000 mistake. “We really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,” he said. G. E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business  —   more than 90 percent of it software  —   may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now. For Predix to reach its potential, though, G. E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the   parade, but will others follow? This will be a major test. And G. E.’s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest. In late July, G. E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1, 200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation. G. E. has some   advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world’s electricity is generated on G. E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G. E. machinery. G. E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the   aviation and health care industries. G. E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software. When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a   company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be “a   journey,” he said. “We’re in the middle of that journey. ” Part of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. “If G. E. is truly going to be a   company, we can’t be separate here,” Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital “tools and habits” need to be embedded “in how people do their jobs,” he said. In its factory in Greenville, S. C. G. E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work. The   building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G. E.’s new gas turbines. It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950, 000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2, 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500, 000 households. The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G. E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology. John Lammas, the    vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a   jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G. E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company’s jet engine and power turbine divisions. “I’m an old mechanical guy,” he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings. In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G. E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part. This    routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use   computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically. This goes a step beyond   design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G. E. calls a “digital thread. ” This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner. Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. “Jobs are combining in this digital world,” Mr. Lammas said. Greenville’s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with   sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1, 000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350, 000 a year. “We can see things we never did before,” Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530, 000 hours over three years, G. E. estimates. Not all the   ideas that G. E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with “minimum viable products,” particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator. Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry. “As an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,” said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. “It’s uncomfortable. But it’s been incredibly liberating. ” The old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. “Overcoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,” he said.",0,2601,10.573170731707316,246,0.3364090734332949,0,0,0,0,93.11954158680102,18.44766219506704,59.41479430988082,36.59900038446751,0.7497116493656286,0.024605920799692427,0.04805843906189927,0.02229911572472126,0.026143790849673203,0.00922722029988466,0.23414071510957324,0.002691272587466359,0.0019223375624759708,0.011534025374855825,0.07766243752402922,0,0.060361399461745485,0.00922722029988466,0.002306805074971165,0.018838908112264515,0.007304882737408689,0.08881199538638986,0.0011534025374855825,0.07650903498654364,0.02883506343713956,0.05420991926182238,0,0.00038446751249519417,0.028450595924644367,0.008458285274894272,0.07458669742406766,0,0,0.002306805074971165,0,0,0.014225297962322183,0.040369088811995385,0.0007689350249903883,0.0007689350249903883,0.41099577085736255,0.004998077662437524,0.011918492887351018,0.0030757400999615533,0.0034602076124567475,0.049980776624375244,0.0011534025374855825,0.0019223375624759708,0.013071895424836602,0.005382545174932718,0.004998077662437524,0.021530180699730873,0.014609765474817378,0.0196078431372549,0.008073817762399077,0.009611687812379853,0.0011534025374855825,0,0.02691272587466359,0.21530180699730872,0.008842752787389465,0.00038446751249519417,0.018838908112264515,0.10688196847366398,0.09073433294886582,0.020376778162245292,0.015763168012302962,0.039600153787004995,0.13610149942329874,0.07035755478662054,0.018069973087274125,0.0011534025374855825,0.02768166089965398,0.13071895424836602,0.00038446751249519417,0.008458285274894272,0.004998077662437524,0.0019223375624759708,0.0038446751249519417,0,0,0.01114955786236063,0.06113033448673587,0.06920415224913495,0,0.021530180699730873,0.0030757400999615533,0.04344482891195694,0.12264513648596694,0.12187620146097655,0.002691272587466359,0.07727797001153403,0,90.625,0,56.5,13.4,25,31.203125,18,29.5,12.83,83.275,24.25,9,44.625,10,90.625,1,203.35,51.203125,200.2,446.75312500000007,203.35,,0.5637014986424151,0,0.4461370043035978,0.16039699613069877,0.2627631645343465,0.30788758597480764,0.2042142754582274,0.29605777990654275,0.15462915146718834,0.5427991272660337,0.2569054280964967,0.11371862058338636,0.38882887313706954,0.12477741009751189,0.3465535705433089,0.014056253642407143,0.06962245396895705,0.01753079524651711,0.06854396500902485,0.15295819464371882,0.05971746578311483,0.8470418053562812,127
402,"How does a former senator . .. stateswoman . .. hoping to build a financial stockpile . .. find a way to make it worth her donors’ while? “Hamilton” tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  —   and status as “event chair” on offer for $100, 000  —   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. “I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show’s signature numbers. “As Washington tells us, history’s eyes are on us,” she said at one point, invoking “History Has Its Eyes On You. ” “Let’s not throw away our shot,” she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show’s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  —   “the only thing,” President Obama has joked, “that Dick Cheney and I agree on. ” The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. “Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president. ” Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy. “It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard. ”",0,457,19.041666666666668,24,0.28227571115973743,0,0,0,0,94.73852940154909,10.784059412505801,91.24490563457331,58.89513549907423,0.7943107221006565,0.0087527352297593,0.05689277899343545,0.02188183807439825,0.030634573304157548,0.0175054704595186,0.29540481400437635,0.002188183807439825,0,0.019693654266958426,0.0962800875273523,0.002188183807439825,0.03938730853391685,0.0087527352297593,0.006564551422319475,0.010940919037199124,0.0087527352297593,0.0700218818380744,0.00437636761487965,0.10284463894967177,0.03282275711159737,0.037199124726477024,0,0.00437636761487965,0.024070021881838075,0.006564551422319475,0.0787746170678337,0,0.00437636761487965,0.002188183807439825,0.030634573304157548,0,0.0087527352297593,0.04157549234135667,0.00437636761487965,0.00437636761487965,0.43982494529540483,0.002188183807439825,0.024070021881838075,0.002188183807439825,0.00437636761487965,0.04814004376367615,0.00437636761487965,0,0.0087527352297593,0.024070021881838075,0.02188183807439825,0.037199124726477024,0.010940919037199124,0.010940919037199124,0.0087527352297593,0.006564551422319475,0,0,0.024070021881838075,0.2275711159737418,0.010940919037199124,0,0.0525164113785558,0.087527352297593,0.0525164113785558,0.06564551422319474,0.024070021881838075,0.045951859956236324,0.1422319474835886,0.1137855579868709,0.01312910284463895,0.00437636761487965,0.06564551422319474,0.1487964989059081,0,0.0087527352297593,0.002188183807439825,0.002188183807439825,0.0262582056892779,0,0.002188183807439825,0.0437636761487965,0.1575492341356674,0.061269146608315096,0.002188183807439825,0.019693654266958426,0,0.07658643326039387,0.11816192560175055,0.11816192560175055,0.0087527352297593,0.019693654266958426,0.0087527352297593,6.55,5.175000000000001,5.625,4,4,0,4,5,0,17,8,12,29.175,0,6.55,0,60.900000000000006,4,36.625,101.52499999999999,60.900000000000006,,0.23015645265954052,0.1910729090157926,0.20429359916620987,0.15438708879488486,0.15438708879488486,0,0.15438708879488486,0.185812113189084,0,0.4369180057775547,0.2674788903885893,0.35388936786452296,0.5711192506114001,0,0.3898754655031444,0,0.11436082813013475,0.007511384442044975,0.0687761137974743,0.190648326369654,0.6104317817289995,0.809351673630346,26

404,"Trump the GreatPaul Craig RobertsLiberals, progressives, and the left-wing (to the extent that one still exists) are aligning with the corrupt oligarchy against president-elect Trump and the American people. They are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over Trump’s “authoritarian personality and followers.” In other words, the message is: here come the fascists.Liberals and progressives wailed and whined about “an all white male cabinet,” only to be made fools by Trump’s appointment of a black male and two women, one a minority and one a Trump critic.The oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt Trump’s inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize Trump the way the paid Maidan protesters were used in Kiev to delegitimize the elected Ukrainian government.To the extent any of the Trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs, such as George Soros, military and financial interests, and global capitalists, they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause Trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence Trump by offering support.At this point we don’t know what a Trump government is going to do. If he sells out the people, he won’t be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. We do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. Trump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy’s stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary’s support is very limited.We know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime’s sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don’t know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.One possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.Another possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.Another possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.What these protesters see as a threat in Trump’s strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.Trump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: “Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don’t have your good in mind. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.”It has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump’s words are what Americans were waiting to hear.As willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.As impressive as Trump’s billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.Congress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. As powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don’t occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.It is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.As for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. If Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump’s determination and the people’s support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets.

405,"Share This Hillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded – and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. There’s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. However, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it’s not only her presidential campaign that’s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she’s convicted of “obstruction of justice” – a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves As of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase “obstruction of justice,” but that doesn’t mean the idea isn’t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. We already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and “bleachbit” her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn’t have the emails they were looking for. Of course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn – and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary’s case. Things aren’t looking so good for Hillary Clinton Why did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple – redemption. According to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: “Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,” said the source. ‘They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.” Further speculation pertaining to Comey’s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. The fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey’s dismissal of Hillary’s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars – a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.",1,688,28.666666666666668,24,0.3066860465116279,0,0,0,0,83.84269102990032,22.28494244773314,59.76372093023256,10.920084566596195,0.8052325581395349,0.005813953488372093,0.05232558139534884,0.06686046511627906,0.040697674418604654,0.00872093023255814,0.14680232558139536,0.0014534883720930232,0.007267441860465116,0.01744186046511628,0.08139534883720931,0,0.06540697674418605,0.00872093023255814,0.00436046511627907,0.014534883720930232,0.010174418604651164,0.14825581395348839,0.0029069767441860465,0.06976744186046512,0.03343023255813953,0.07122093023255814,0,0,0.04941860465116279,0.01308139534883721,0.07267441860465117,0,0.0014534883720930232,0.0029069767441860465,0.020348837209302327,0,0.00872093023255814,0.04796511627906977,0,0,0.5101744186046512,0.0014534883720930232,0.0029069767441860465,0,0,0.05232558139534884,0.0029069767441860465,0.0029069767441860465,0.046511627906976744,0.011627906976744186,0.00436046511627907,0.01308139534883721,0.0029069767441860465,0.011627906976744186,0.014534883720930232,0.02616279069767442,0,0.0029069767441860465,0.014534883720930232,0.24563953488372092,0.007267441860465116,0,0.0188953488372093,0.03343023255813953,0.030523255813953487,0.046511627906976744,0.014534883720930232,0.036337209302325583,0.16424418604651161,0.09883720930232558,0.023255813953488372,0.0014534883720930232,0.014534883720930232,0.1119186046511628,0.0029069767441860465,0.014534883720930232,0.00872093023255814,0.005813953488372093,0.011627906976744186,0,0,0.030523255813953487,0.08139534883720931,0.06540697674418605,0,0.046511627906976744,0.00872093023255814,0.0377906976744186,0.14098837209302326,0.14534883720930233,0.0029069767441860465,0.023255813953488372,0.00436046511627907,16.75,0,46,1,9.725,0.325,5,59.75,2.83,48,14.25,0,11.5,0,16.75,1,48.135,13.825,158.75,218.71,48.135,,0.4332766582436166,0,0.6773780526836762,0.043651153027571284,0.3074233430864605,0.01461731708684262,0.185812113189084,0.7317022188265295,0.11439472801411892,0.6866078342050883,0.39409382181158087,0,0.34421963034472003,0,0.7187882045137153,0.043651153027571284,0.05718715472074704,0.01642489693599933,0.18860415107341008,0.25984008744104264,-0.8771524057479515,0.7401599125589573,65
406,"Having booked their flights and secured their hotels, travelers often consider rental cars among the last of their   tasks, making the unprepared more vulnerable to the    of industry fees. “Our number one advice for renters is to do their homework,” said David Solomito, vice president of marketing for North America at Kayak. “For most people, rental cars are the least considered part of trip. ” As technology has changed travel  —   consider toll roads, which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  —   so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars. “It’s not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees, it’s just that there’s more of them,” said Rick Garlick, who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at J. D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). “Ancillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability,” he said. There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location that’s not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters’ wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought. Assuming you haven’t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. “At Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with,” wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a “fuel service” charge of $16. 07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40, 000 “connected” cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility. “We carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim,” wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. “Cars aren’t getting smarter, we need to be,” said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach. “If you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. ” Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes. Most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads. But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2. 95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4. 95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19. 75 per rental month Hertz charges $24. 75 maximum per rental agreement and Payless charges $14. 75 maximum for each rental period. Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3. 95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19. 75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists) avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The   can be used in most Northeastern and   states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a  . Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesn’t take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. “It messes with their inventory and planning,” said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. “Returning a car early is considered breaking the contract. ” How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car, for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, “to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. ” Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10   fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they don’t call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Parking or traffic tickets are the driver’s responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, it’s in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Avis’s contract says offenses will be charged back to the renter’s credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation. “What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away,” Ms. Fix said. “You have to be aware. ”",0,1117,18.311475409836067,61,0.3178155774395703,0,0,0,0,93.42048013521105,32.42383936564778,70.45355478035378,30.29600971991303,0.8102059086839749,0.007162041181736795,0.04297224709042077,0.03670546105640107,0.018800358102059087,0.008952551477170993,0.1674127126230976,0.0017905102954341987,0.005371530886302597,0.011638316920322292,0.10116383169203223,0,0.06535362578334826,0.0017905102954341987,0,0.022381378692927483,0.0026857654431512983,0.08952551477170993,0,0.05640107430617726,0.02954341987466428,0.05371530886302596,0,0,0.025067144136078783,0.008057296329453895,0.045658012533572066,0,0,0.0008952551477170994,0.0008952551477170994,0,0.012533572068039392,0.023276633840644583,0.0017905102954341987,0.0017905102954341987,0.4512085944494181,0.0008952551477170994,0.009847806624888093,0.03312444046553268,0.0035810205908683975,0.03401969561324977,0,0,0.012533572068039392,0.018800358102059087,0.008952551477170993,0.0017905102954341987,0.06982990152193375,0.03133393017009848,0.008057296329453895,0.008057296329453895,0,0,0.02685765443151298,0.22023276633840644,0.01432408236347359,0.0017905102954341987,0.01342882721575649,0.05640107430617726,0.11548791405550582,0.04207699194270367,0.010743061772605193,0.018800358102059087,0.1414503133393017,0.07699194270367055,0.02775290957923008,0,0.02685765443151298,0.1504028648164727,0,0.004476275738585497,0.007162041181736795,0.0008952551477170994,0.0026857654431512983,0,0.0008952551477170994,0.0008952551477170994,0.07162041181736795,0.06535362578334826,0,0.03581020590868397,0.018800358102059087,0.05461056401074306,0.11548791405550582,0.11280214861235452,0.007162041181736795,0.051029543419874666,0.011638316920322292,0,0,46,1,0,0,7,0,9,32.75,15,7,14,0,0,0,41,9,87.75,128.75,41,,0,0,0.5684029842804529,0.027833058566977823,0,0,0.16695088706406638,0,0.20487838941028416,0.48390553539995074,0.3004296240172758,0.16695088706406638,0.28613181396879245,0,0.3073658842498213,0,0.03425945268435346,0.007520367662419052,0.07332358470858576,0.10758303739293922,-0.654320393641089,0.8924169626070608,49
407,"WASHINGTON  —   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate’s    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, “coup” has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil’s entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party’s leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Jucá, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, “We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ” Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  —   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges “don’t rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,” adding: “It’s not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ” This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  —   which the impeachers were indeed doing  —   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  —   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil’s economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff’s supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  —   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff’s ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  —   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. “When people talk about ‘coup mongers,’ ” said Professor Smith, “they’re often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ” But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff’s staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  —   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil’s system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.",0,902,23.736842105263158,38,0.360310421286031,0,0,0,0,88.39442265052021,8.756016722099037,67.51948051948052,55.00212860310421,0.8059866962305987,0.02328159645232816,0.04656319290465632,0.03436807095343681,0.05543237250554324,0.015521064301552107,0.1629711751662971,0.012195121951219513,0.0022172949002217295,0.017738359201773836,0.09645232815964523,0.0011086474501108647,0.07427937915742794,0.005543237250554324,0.0022172949002217295,0.012195121951219513,0.014412416851441241,0.10421286031042129,0.0033259423503325942,0.0598669623059867,0.015521064301552107,0.052106430155210645,0,0.0011086474501108647,0.037694013303769404,0.012195121951219513,0.14079822616407983,0,0,0.0022172949002217295,0.028824833702882482,0,0.005543237250554324,0.03547671840354767,0.0011086474501108647,0.0011086474501108647,0.48004434589800443,0.004434589800443459,0.0033259423503325942,0.004434589800443459,0,0.07206208425720621,0.0011086474501108647,0,0.019955654101995565,0.015521064301552107,0.008869179600886918,0,0.014412416851441241,0.014412416851441241,0.014412416851441241,0.019955654101995565,0,0,0.004434589800443459,0.19955654101995565,0.008869179600886918,0,0.018847006651884702,0.057649667405764965,0.08647450110864745,0.024390243902439025,0.03547671840354767,0.10643015521064302,0.13303769401330376,0.09645232815964523,0.017738359201773836,0.0011086474501108647,0.014412416851441241,0.09201773835920177,0,0.005543237250554324,0.005543237250554324,0.0011086474501108647,0.011086474501108648,0,0,0.008869179600886918,0.0942350332594235,0.052106430155210645,0,0.022172949002217297,0.012195121951219513,0.026607538802660754,0.10753880266075388,0.11751662971175167,0.0011086474501108647,0.06319290465631928,0.0022172949002217295,31,0,146.7,2,0,24,10,116.825,12.725,52.5,0,18.725,25,0,31,0,84.725,36,240.2,347.92499999999995,84.725,,0.5292983948776431,0,0.8418064011772486,0.06764046958777896,0,0.4654040222844057,0.2661832955178855,0.8090760709431952,0.3158109152238735,0.6556918627579345,0,0.4044879476537309,0.4755736118852673,0,0.4080046430562116,0,0.07412997353282148,0.03149812979854321,0.21016252160027998,0.3044163002821707,-0.8885880669461295,0.6955836997178293,107
408,"  Donald J. Trump on Tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises, dropping his vow to jail Hillary Clinton, expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change. But in a   hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times  —   which was scheduled, canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules  —   Mr. Trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the American presidency. He said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his White House, conceding that the Trump brand “is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ” Still, he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses, which would be run by his children. He defended Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, against charges of racism, calling him a “decent guy. ” And he mocked Republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign. In the midday meeting in the   boardroom of The Times’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Mr. Trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job. “It is a very overwhelming job, but I’m not overwhelmed by it,” he said. He displayed a jumble of impulses, many of them conflicting. He was magnanimous toward Mrs. Clinton, but boastful about his victory. He was   about some of his positions, uncompromising about others. The interview demonstrated the volatility in Mr. Trump’s positions. He said he had no interest in pressing for Mrs. Clinton’s prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the Clinton Foundation. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” he said. On the issue of torture, Mr. Trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. “He said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful,’” Mr. Trump said. He added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects: “‘Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I’ll do better. ’” “I was very impressed by that answer,” Mr. Trump said. Torture, he said, is “not going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking. ” Mr. Trump repeated that Mr. Mattis was being “seriously, seriously considered” to be secretary of defense. “I think it’s time, maybe, for a general,” he said. On climate change, Mr. Trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying, “I’m looking at it very closely. ” Despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the Paris accords, Mr. Trump said that “I have an open mind to it” and that clean air and “crystal clear water” were vitally important. He held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas. He vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, where attendees gave the Nazi salute and criticized Jews. Asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws, Mr. Trump offered no specifics but told the group, “I think you’ll be happy. ” Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the “failing New York Times,” Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called “a great, great American jewel, world jewel. ” He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that “the law’s totally on my side” when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would “like to do something” and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for    photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. “If it were up to some people,” he said, “I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. ” Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms. Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. “I might have brought it up,” Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his    Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East. “The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants, but I don’t want to do that,” Mr. Trump said. But he said that Mr. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, “could be very helpful” in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Kushner “would be very good at it” and that “he knows the region. ” “A lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible  —   you can’t do it,” Mr. Trump added. “I disagree. I think you can make peace. ” “I have reason to believe I can do it,” he added. Mr. Trump spoke only in general terms about foreign policy. He said the United States should not “be a nation builder,” repeated his line from the campaign that fighting the war in Iraq was “one of the great mistakes in the history of our country,” and said he has some “very definitive” and “strong ideas” about how to deal with the violent civil war raging in Syria. He declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so. “We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria,” he said. The   said that he had talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the election, but he did not elaborate. He said it would be “nice” if he and Mr. Putin could get along, but he rejected the idea that any warming of relations would be called a “reset,” noting the criticism that Mrs. Clinton received after her attempts at bettering relations between the countries failed. “I wouldn’t use that term after what happened,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump made a forceful defense of Mr. Bannon, whom he named as his chief strategist and who has drawn charges of racism and  . This summer, Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News, the website he led, “the platform for the ” a white nationalist movement. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon had been dismayed at the reaction to his hiring. “I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or ” he said, “I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. ” Mr. Trump added: “I think he’s having a hard time with it because it’s not him. I think he’s been treated very unfairly. ” He also defended Breitbart, which has carried racist and   content, saying it was no different from The Times, only “much more conservative. ” Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a “great   relationship” with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. “I really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot,” he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races. He said that one of them, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, would “love to have a job in the administration. ” “I said, ‘No, thank you,’” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat to Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. “She refused to vote for me. ” He also criticized Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who vacillated over supporting Mr. Trump after an    recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged in lewd terms about grabbing women without their consent. “He went down like a lead balloon,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Heck. “I said, ‘Off the record, I hope you lose. ’” He said Republican leaders felt indebted to him for his surprise victory. “Right now,” Mr. Trump said, “they’re in love with me. ”",0,1593,19.426829268292682,82,0.27369742623979915,0,0,0,0,73.45171434549965,1.1457464027670081,89.17564344005021,36.84127673958182,0.8336472065285625,0.015065913370998116,0.03515379786566227,0.03452605147520402,0.06465787821720025,0.010671688637790333,0.22912743251726303,0.010671688637790333,0.004394224733207784,0.017576898932831136,0.06716886377903326,0.0012554927809165098,0.07595731324544884,0.005021971123666039,0,0.016321406151914627,0.008788449466415568,0.1029504080351538,0.0012554927809165098,0.06089139987445072,0.013182674199623353,0.0389202762084118,0,0.0012554927809165098,0.02824858757062147,0.0194601381042059,0.10043942247332077,0,0.0006277463904582549,0.005021971123666039,0.006905210295040804,0,0.007532956685499058,0.07344632768361582,0.0012554927809165098,0.0012554927809165098,0.4971751412429379,0.0012554927809165098,0.028876333961079723,0.0018832391713747645,0.023854362837413684,0.04833647206528562,0.003138731952291274,0.0025109855618330196,0.0194601381042059,0.015065913370998116,0.005021971123666039,0.10106716886377903,0.006277463904582548,0.011927181418706842,0.014438166980539862,0.02824858757062147,0.0018832391713747645,0,0.0018832391713747645,0.22473320778405526,0.0018832391713747645,0,0.04143126177024482,0.07972379158819837,0.047080979284369114,0.11173885750156937,0.03452605147520402,0.06779661016949153,0.1349654739485248,0.160075329566855,0.01694915254237288,0,0.06779661016949153,0.09918392969240426,0.0012554927809165098,0.013182674199623353,0.008160703075957313,0.007532956685499058,0.007532956685499058,0,0,0.07846829880728186,0.18581293157564344,0.05524168236032643,0.0012554927809165098,0.02071563088512241,0.003766478342749529,0.032642812303829254,0.14438166980539863,0.15630885122410546,0.0012554927809165098,0.03766478342749529,0.004394224733207784,117.875,0,190,6,39,27,26.025,78,19,111,37,30,54.75,0,117.875,13.25,243.75,68.275,343.6,642.625,243.75,,0.7442923269839247,0,0.8243060488131078,0.12904082342630863,0.49058508439238474,0.40001829142820605,0.39122446492190605,0.6582449932301108,0.31934429694294786,0.7326881945180898,0.4774383694370016,0.42555054578242596,0.5748217764713107,0,0.5871744376742377,0.24652578439154252,0.11737795702160958,0.032877866730873416,0.16546078372358997,0.30945644976825376,-0.7771296336881918,0.6905435502317463,159
409,"Stephanie Danler’s first novel, “Sweetbitter,” about a young woman in New York City’s restaurant world, is going to make a lot of people hungry. It did me, at any rate. My copy, I notice, has some grease stains in it, a few red pepper flakes, a stubby bit of mint. “Sweetbitter” will be consumed with special avidity by young food people  —   sommeliers, cheesemakers, sous chefs, managers, pastry wizards  —   who dream of making it in the big city, or at least of making it by   standards. It’s an unpretentious,     novel  —   bought by Knopf  in an     deal  —   that reads like a letter home from a   friend. In this case, that friend is named Tess, like Thomas Hardy’s heroine and Melanie Griffith’s striving secretary in “Working Girl. ” This Tess is 22 when she escapes her unnamed hometown and its “twin pillars of football and church” and drives into Manhattan. “Let’s say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at 7 a. m.,” she says, “with the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. ” Thanks to her poise and friendly good looks, Tess finds a job as an apprentice server at a restaurant that’s clearly modeled after Union Square Cafe, one of Manhattan’s best. (The author has worked at Union Square Cafe and at another cheerful restaurant, Buvette.) She finds a scuzzy apartment in a cheap section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tess falls deeply into her work and feels the city begin to unfold for her. Ms. Danler is a sensitive observer of the almost wartime camaraderie among workers at a restaurant that’s humming at full capacity, of the exhaustion, of the postshift drinking in dive bars until dawn, of the sex and other stimulants  —   the biggest one simply being young and alive and open to the animal and intellectual possibilities that New York offers. Once upon a time, this sort of aspirational, young person’s novel was written about writers and artists. Food workers are climbing the status ladder. Now these novels are about chefs or even, in this case, servers. This book has an onrushing “Bright Lights, Big City” vibe and falls into an emerging genre you might call Bright Lights, Small Plates. A restaurant, like a platoon in a war novel, allows a writer to deploy a large cast with relative ease. In “Sweetbitter” we meet a handsome if   young bartender (“He drank like he was the only person who understood beer”) an enigmatic female head server who is Tess’s mentor and tormentor a harried chef a manager who does more than ogle his favorite female employees. None feel like stereotypes. A subtle sense of melancholy hangs over these men and women. They’re happy to be where they are in fact, they feel chosen. But they’re nearly all here because of other dreams that were thwarted. They’re failed poets or academics. Tess had hoped to be a photographer. “Sweetbitter” is the story of Tess’s sentimental education. We don’t learn much about her past. But in Manhattan we watch her  —   she is vulnerable but rarely weak  —   pour herself full with books and art and music, and blossom like a daisy. Mostly she fills herself with lovely things to eat and drink. Tess isn’t a hipster (“I cared too much about the wrong things”). And Ms. Danler isn’t another Anthony Bourdain manqué, delivering a caustic exposé. She takes the reader by the hand as Tess learns dozens of lessons, from distinguishing among varieties of oysters, types of winter lettuce and appellations of Burgundy to opening wine properly to appreciating a pig’s head terrine. Tess knows she will, at some point, want more than this. But for now this punishing life feels like ravishment. When a college acquaintance comes into the restaurant one night and condescends to her, only politeness prevents her from speaking aloud: “I chose this life because it’s a constant assault of color and taste and light and it’s raw and ugly and fast and it’s mine. And you’ll never understand. Until you live it, you don’t know. ” This novel, which reads a bit like a food world version of Curtis Sittenfeld’s “Prep,” gets off to a bad start. You notice that its four sections are named after the seasons, as if they were George Winston albums. At the beginning there are gimmicky interpolated sections about things like the nature of sweet versus sour. You fear you may be headed into a genre fiction tunnel of love. Those fears are quickly dispelled. Ms. Danler is a gifted commenter (chilly autumn air in Manhattan “tasted of steel knives and filtered water”) on many things, class especially. An awareness of privilege runs through this novel like a tendon. “If you’re good at this job,” she asks, “what exactly are you good at?” “Sweetbitter” grows darker than you might expect, in terms of where Tess’s desires lead her. It’s a book about hunger of every variety, even the sort that can disturb you and make you sometimes ask yourself, as does Tess, “Was I a monster or was this what it felt like to be a person?”",0,906,18.489795918367346,49,0.27704194260485654,0,0,0,0,87.48030300104904,19.750183958793226,75.32270971302428,46.07505518763797,0.8211920529801324,0.012141280353200883,0.06070640176600441,0.03200883002207505,0.04525386313465784,0.01434878587196468,0.20750551876379691,0.004415011037527594,0.004415011037527594,0.03090507726269316,0.07836644591611479,0,0.06291390728476821,0.04194260485651214,0.004415011037527594,0.011037527593818985,0.00772626931567329,0.08498896247240618,0.0011037527593818985,0.06622516556291391,0.03200883002207505,0.059602649006622516,0,0.002207505518763797,0.023178807947019868,0.008830022075055188,0.06622516556291391,0,0,0.00772626931567329,0.03090507726269316,0,0.009933774834437087,0.026490066225165563,0.004415011037527594,0.004415011037527594,0.46578366445916114,0.00772626931567329,0.006622516556291391,0.0033112582781456954,0.009933774834437087,0.056291390728476824,0,0.02759381898454746,0.02097130242825607,0.013245033112582781,0.03421633554083885,0.004415011037527594,0.002207505518763797,0.017660044150110375,0.006622516556291391,0.016556291390728478,0,0,0.011037527593818985,0.23730684326710816,0.00772626931567329,0.004415011037527594,0.03863134657836645,0.05518763796909492,0.0706401766004415,0.056291390728476824,0.02759381898454746,0.03421633554083885,0.1467991169977925,0.11258278145695365,0.023178807947019868,0.002207505518763797,0.039735099337748346,0.13796909492273732,0.0011037527593818985,0.00772626931567329,0.005518763796909493,0.002207505518763797,0.01545253863134658,0,0.0011037527593818985,0.024282560706401765,0.08940397350993377,0.07836644591611479,0,0.026490066225165563,0.0033112582781456954,0.04304635761589404,0.12472406181015452,0.12251655629139073,0.004415011037527594,0.03090507726269316,0.01434878587196468,38.375,0,32.25,3,4,0,54.8125,19.75,11,31,22,34,53.25,0,38.375,0,140.625,67.8125,87.25,293.3125,140.625,,0.5507322992054055,0,0.5074348913023092,0.08745093208546979,0.11329855470953135,0,0.6364853920723846,0.38683809010054765,0.26001684346329174,0.4975527492057225,0.41271963118938554,0.5206343335801141,0.6297679667345653,0,0.5054896836385049,0,0.12496528742016107,0.06026103860038878,0.07753401832824215,0.2606498194945848,0.7068511852768032,0.7393501805054152,74
410,"GLENDALE, Ariz.  —   Mark Few wrote the introduction for a book by his college roommate about the power of perseverance. On Saturday night, the Gonzaga men’s basketball team, which Few has built from a midmajor curiosity into a championship contender, provided him with material for a postscript. Gonzaga, making its 19th consecutive N. C. A. A. tournament appearance but its first trip to the Final Four, advanced to the national championship game with a   victory over South Carolina at University of Phoenix Stadium. In the final on Monday night, the Bulldogs will face a fellow No. 1 seed, North Carolina, which beat Oregon by   later on Saturday. Nigel   a junior guard, contributed 23 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, and his freshman roommate, Zach Collins, added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Gonzaga, a program that thrust itself into the national consciousness by reaching the round of 8 in 1999  —   but until this season had never gotten any further. This season, the Bulldogs ( ) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the national polls before being dealt their only loss, to Brigham Young, in their final game of the regular season. On Saturday night, they could barely contain their excitement at the opportunity they had given themselves to be unequivocally known as college basketball’s best. Few, who is known for his   demeanor, was so overcome with emotion that he executed a handstand in the locker room. “I felt like I stuck it,” he said with a laugh, adding: “Sometimes I worry that my guys get like, it’s a job. And we’ve been on them to show emotion. So that’s my fairly weak effort of showing emotion. ” South Carolina ( ) a seventh seed that had defied all expectation to get so far, was also making its first trip to the Final Four. The Gamecocks were led by Chris Silva, who had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sindarius Thornwell, a senior guard who had not scored fewer than 24 points in a tournament game this year, was held to a relatively quiet 15. “We played our hearts out the way we did all year,” the senior Justin McKie said, “and Gonzaga played a great game. ” It was just a matter of patience. In his book, “Water the Bamboo,” Few’s college roommate, Greg Bell, used the plant as a metaphor for success. Even with regular watering, giant timber bamboo does not appear to make any gains for the first three years of its life. But then, suddenly, it will sprout 90 feet in just two months. It took the Bulldogs considerably longer to reach their newfound height, but that only made Saturday’s result all the sweeter. Few’s South Carolina counterpart, Frank Martin, overcame a hardscrabble childhood to build a successful career in coaching, and his tailored suits cannot hide his rough edges. His intensity, embodied by his icy sideline stare, has rubbed off on his players. After   the Gonzaga players gathered in a circle, and as they were breaking apart, a few South Carolina players sauntered through the huddle, bumping a few of the Bulldogs as they passed. Then, before the opening tip, Gonzaga center Przemek Karnowski approached Thornwell, one senior to another, and extended his hand. Thornwell, the Gamecocks’ leading scorer, brushed past him, leaving Karnowski to stare quizzically at Thornwell’s back and shrug. “Maybe that’s how he is,” Karnowski said after the game. “I don’t really know him personally. ” Karnowski was happy to be on the floor at all. He missed most of last season with a   injury that required surgery. At 7 feet 1 inch and 300 pounds, Karnowski had four inches and more than 70 pounds on Silva, the sophomore forward from Gabon who was given the gargantuan task of guarding him under the basket. Fourteen minutes into the game, Silva rose to block Karnowski’s shot and made contact with Karnowski, who fell to the floor like a   Douglas fir. No foul was called, and while he writhed in pain, the Gamecocks pushed the ball up the court, with P. J. Dozier feeding McKie for a   that tied the score at  . Karnowski was helped to the sideline with a sore right elbow and a poked right eye, leaving Gonzaga, which had by then gotten 6 points and 4 rebounds from him, with a hole in the middle. Collins, a   freshman forward, filled it immediately. He contributed three rebounds, including two on the defensive end, to go with 2 points and a blocked shot in a frenetic stretch over the next 2 minutes 30 seconds to help Gonzaga to a   halftime lead. By then, Karnowski was already in the locker room. He could not open his right eye. But those missed games from last season were enough for him. He was back in the lineup at the start of the second half. “The doctor said I’m good to go, so I was just real happy about it,” he said. Twice in the tournament, South Carolina had stormed back from halftime deficits, and it would be no different against Gonzaga. The first two times, Thornwell was the spark. This time it was Silva who led the charge as the Gamecocks tied the game at   and then took the lead on two free throws by Rakym Felder. “That just showed the heart of a lion,” Few said, adding, “It took everything we had to hold on and come back. ” Cultivated though it has been, Gonzaga’s offense did have to deal with a dry spell. The Bulldogs stalled when Karnowski’s teammates tried too often to force the ball inside to him, leading to turnovers that the Gamecocks turned into points at the other end. But it was a storm the Bulldogs could weather. Karnowski had 7 points in the second half to finish with 13. His understudy, Collins, had a sensational second half, with 6 points, 7 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. “We did a really good job, I thought, of just sticking together,” Karnowski said. “That’s what we did the entire season. We don’t have 37 wins for nothing. ” As Few and a handful of his players made their way up the steps to the   dais, the moderator announced, “Gonzaga has arrived. ” It just took longer than perhaps Few would have expected. “To be playing the last game of the year is crazy cool,” he said.",0,1068,16.952380952380953,63,0.28277153558052437,0,0,0,0,92.62833932433553,27.00054099042863,70.65762624305825,42.7755690002881,0.8127340823970037,0.025280898876404494,0.05711610486891386,0.03277153558052434,0.03089887640449438,0.028089887640449437,0.19101123595505617,0.0009363295880149813,0.0009363295880149813,0.016853932584269662,0.10205992509363296,0.0009363295880149813,0.06179775280898876,0.017790262172284643,0.009363295880149813,0.0149812734082397,0.00749063670411985,0.06367041198501873,0.0009363295880149813,0.08333333333333333,0.025280898876404494,0.04588014981273408,0,0,0.018726591760299626,0.006554307116104869,0.08895131086142322,0,0,0.009363295880149813,0,0,0.008426966292134831,0.07771535580524344,0.0056179775280898875,0.0056179775280898875,0.4700374531835206,0.006554307116104869,0.009363295880149813,0.0046816479400749065,0.008426966292134831,0.0449438202247191,0.0009363295880149813,0.0028089887640449437,0.006554307116104869,0.011235955056179775,0.024344569288389514,0.03089887640449438,0.0018726591760299626,0.023408239700374533,0.011235955056179775,0.009363295880149813,0,0,0.05056179775280899,0.2565543071161049,0.0018726591760299626,0.0018726591760299626,0.0299625468164794,0.0599250936329588,0.05711610486891386,0.054307116104868915,0.018726591760299626,0.026217228464419477,0.14232209737827714,0.09925093632958802,0.02247191011235955,0,0.026217228464419477,0.17415730337078653,0,0.025280898876404494,0.0046816479400749065,0.0028089887640449437,0.010299625468164793,0,0,0.028089887640449437,0.0852059925093633,0.09082397003745318,0,0.009363295880149813,0.010299625468164793,0.06741573033707865,0.1198501872659176,0.12453183520599251,0.00749063670411985,0.0299625468164794,0,52.2,7,16,2,4.475,10,0,6,17.08,19,18.25,43.475,19.325,19,52.2,6,131.60500000000002,33,64.025,218.605,131.60500000000002,,0.5952348460809374,0.16471953004969767,0.3107008557545449,0.05333834187674792,0.11195482743441748,0.21979723016032496,0,0.14459058185587106,0.3248600975716457,0.3486463796144118,0.3395571289859434,0.5505152077236206,0.35250782099925954,0.3486463796144118,0.33678068017340235,0.14459058185587106,0.10808513434159683,0.027102385420559212,0.052582734137918294,0.1795368777230711,0.7291772254532131,0.820463122276929,69
411,".@SebGorka: ”@POTUS is not an interventionist   . Nothing has changed.” #SundayFutures @MariaBartiromo pic. twitter.  On this weekend’s broadcast of “Sunday Morning Futures” on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump’s deputy assistant Dr. Sebastian Gorka said Trump was “not an interventionist   . ”  Gorka said, “I would like to make one thing very clear because there’s been a lot of missed reporting on this. The president is not an interventionist   . nothing has changed from November 7th 2 today. He’s been explicit. We are not invading other people’s countries. This isn’t some neoconservative   administration. Nevertheless, we have obligations to our friends in the region and on top of that, things like weapons of mass distraction, nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue regimes, chemical weapons, those will not be countenanced because they are a threat to Americans as well and that is why you see the leadership out of the White House you are seen. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0,165,16.5,10,0.30303030303030304,0,0,0.006060606060606061,0,69.16991341991343,39.43550893550894,54.815850815850816,5.954545454545454,0.8242424242424242,0.012121212121212121,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.048484848484848485,0.03636363636363636,0.24848484848484848,0.024242424242424242,0.006060606060606061,0.03636363636363636,0.06666666666666667,0,0.10909090909090909,0.012121212121212121,0.006060606060606061,0.03636363636363636,0.024242424242424242,0.13333333333333333,0.006060606060606061,0.04242424242424243,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0,0,0.048484848484848485,0.006060606060606061,0.08484848484848485,0,0,0.006060606060606061,0,0,0.01818181818181818,0.05454545454545454,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.48484848484848486,0.006060606060606061,0.012121212121212121,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.05454545454545454,0.024242424242424242,0,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.024242424242424242,0.006060606060606061,0,0.01818181818181818,0.048484848484848485,0.030303030303030304,0.01818181818181818,0.006060606060606061,0.01818181818181818,0.24242424242424243,0.030303030303030304,0,0.048484848484848485,0.08484848484848485,0.06666666666666667,0.048484848484848485,0.012121212121212121,0.048484848484848485,0.12121212121212122,0.10303030303030303,0.012121212121212121,0,0.048484848484848485,0.14545454545454545,0,0,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0,0,0.006060606060606061,0.08484848484848485,0.07272727272727272,0,0.012121212121212121,0.006060606060606061,0.05454545454545454,0.17575757575757575,0.1696969696969697,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.012121212121212121,1,0,12,0,0,4,0,0,0,14,6.5,1,8.25,0,1,0,16.75,4,21.25,36.75,16.75,,0.06604088253131131,0,0.45902906222806084,0,0,0.2204812092115424,0,0,0,0.4974746830583267,0.3148898989175986,0.06604088253131131,0.36843292389032944,0,0.33890959404526927,0,0.08921438082556592,0.02130492676431425,0.11318242343541944,0.19573901464713714,-0.3103448275862069,0.8042609853528628,14
412,"  Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor   31st, 2016 Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had   and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds   And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… Florida Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . Georgia Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . North Carolina Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . Ohio No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . Colorado Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . Arizona A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . Nevada One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US   told CNN. But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. But will we get it? Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.",1,1141,30.026315789473685,38,0.3339176161262051,0,0,0,0,88.28230971482505,43.84075956763074,52.1034180543383,45.07132744556057,0.7773882559158632,0.021910604732690624,0.05083260297984225,0.03768624014022787,0.03593339176161262,0.007011393514460999,0.11393514460999124,0,0.0026292725679228747,0.012269938650306749,0.07887817703768624,0.0008764241893076249,0.08326029798422437,0.0008764241893076249,0,0.021034180543382998,0.014899211218229623,0.13146362839614373,0.0017528483786152498,0.03680981595092025,0.03067484662576687,0.04820333041191937,0.0026292725679228747,0,0.03418054338299737,0.019281332164767746,0.06222611744084137,0,0.0008764241893076249,0.0008764241893076249,0.0052585451358457495,0,0.012269938650306749,0.04294478527607362,0.0017528483786152498,0.0017528483786152498,0.45574057843996496,0.0008764241893076249,0.0008764241893076249,0.0008764241893076249,0.0026292725679228747,0.05346187554776512,0.0008764241893076249,0,0.022787028921998246,0.007887817703768623,0.0043821209465381246,0.007011393514460999,0.009640666082383873,0.024539877300613498,0.011393514460999123,0.012269938650306749,0,0,0.026292725679228746,0.24890446976336547,0.006134969325153374,0,0.016652059596844872,0.03856266432953549,0.040315512708150744,0.022787028921998246,0.022787028921998246,0.03593339176161262,0.13496932515337423,0.07624890446976336,0.025416301489921123,0.0026292725679228747,0.013146362839614373,0.17090271691498685,0,0.011393514460999123,0.0052585451358457495,0.0017528483786152498,0.014899211218229623,0,0,0.010517090271691499,0.049079754601226995,0.06485539000876424,0,0.03680981595092025,0.0052585451358457495,0.08413672217353199,0.14636283961437335,0.147239263803681,0.0035056967572304996,0.03418054338299737,0.0008764241893076249,17.625,0,11,2,15,25.25,2,27,3.705,53.878750000000004,24.5,52.375,18,0,17.625,5,124.52499999999999,29.25,111.87875,259.15375000000006,124.52499999999999,,0.38999318421070067,0,0.28520981619089963,0.06764046958777896,0.35237656553776947,0.478055840576263,0.06764046958777896,0.494794600415225,0.11847243463826163,0.6615203860067702,0.4705376453985657,0.6551534983650236,0.3950131997138715,0,0.552234052671376,0.15352447281755405,0.0936169972832088,0.02198993913297617,0.08410963770165666,0.19482992097718033,0.3934758391953315,0.8051700790228197,70
413,"Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the “Great Democratic Inversion.” What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. A key word in Edsall’s analysis is “white.” Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters–blacks and Hispanics –are poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. {snip} There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. {snip} Republicans’ constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats’ sprawling coalition. The parties won’t fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can’t trust the GOP to represent them. If it doesn’t diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip} {snip}",1,436,18.956521739130434,23,0.4013761467889908,0,0,0,0,95.7621355622048,11.39573041637262,58.17007762879322,46.93577981651376,0.7362385321100917,0.02522935779816514,0.07568807339449542,0.03211009174311927,0.05045871559633028,0.011467889908256881,0.1743119266055046,0.006880733944954129,0.006880733944954129,0.013761467889908258,0.0871559633027523,0,0.0481651376146789,0,0,0.006880733944954129,0.006880733944954129,0.05733944954128441,0,0.045871559633027525,0.02981651376146789,0.04357798165137615,0.016055045871559634,0,0.022935779816513763,0.0045871559633027525,0.06651376146788991,0,0,0.0045871559633027525,0.0022935779816513763,0,0.013761467889908258,0.011467889908256881,0,0,0.3967889908256881,0,0,0,0,0.0389908256880734,0.0022935779816513763,0,0.016055045871559634,0.0045871559633027525,0.009174311926605505,0.0022935779816513763,0.006880733944954129,0.011467889908256881,0.011467889908256881,0.01834862385321101,0.0022935779816513763,0,0.03211009174311927,0.20412844036697247,0.03211009174311927,0.0022935779816513763,0.027522935779816515,0.05504587155963303,0.09174311926605505,0.016055045871559634,0.02981651376146789,0.03211009174311927,0.1353211009174312,0.05504587155963303,0.022935779816513763,0,0.009174311926605505,0.10321100917431193,0.0022935779816513763,0.0022935779816513763,0.006880733944954129,0.0045871559633027525,0.022935779816513763,0,0,0,0.052752293577981654,0.05504587155963303,0,0.011467889908256881,0.013761467889908258,0.034403669724770644,0.0871559633027523,0.08256880733944955,0,0.07568807339449542,0.0022935779816513763,20.25,0,26,0,5,3,7,8,1,21,3,16,6,0,20.25,0,43.25,12,63,118.25,43.25,,0.4856393379309364,0,0.547972799408761,0,0.18905299528192204,0.12271137864430522,0.24606636040557303,0.2716689007985296,0.04454817121901355,0.49472749368797625,0.12271137864430522,0.4272635756491935,0.2185982630593474,0,0.37738466551152516,0,0.08297362110311751,0.02302158273381295,0.12086330935251799,0.22685851318944844,-0.5656472937756423,0.7731414868105515,33
414,"After the announcement of his nomination to the US Supreme Court on Tuesday, Judge Neil Gorsuch praised former Justice Antonin Scalia as a “lion of the law. ” And stated, “it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ”  Gorsuch said, “I pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country. ” Gorsuch then talked about his experience on the bench, saying that he’s been inspired by the judges he worked with who he has watched “fearlessly tending to the rule of law, enforcing the promises of our Constitution, and living out daily their judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike, following the law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs. I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people’s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. ” He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were “towering judges” and Scalia was “a lion of the law. ” He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as “one of the smartest and most courageous men I’ve ever known. ” Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him “so much. ” Gorsuch further stated, “[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn’t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what’s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,462,25.666666666666668,18,0.30303030303030304,0,0,0,0,89.96324281778827,4.5165264504887155,77.56290174471994,97.38383004278958,0.8506493506493507,0.017316017316017316,0.06277056277056277,0.02813852813852814,0.0670995670995671,0.023809523809523808,0.18181818181818182,0,0,0.017316017316017316,0.10173160173160173,0,0.045454545454545456,0.008658008658008658,0.0021645021645021645,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.09307359307359307,0.0021645021645021645,0.07575757575757576,0.04329004329004329,0.06060606060606061,0,0,0.02813852813852814,0.012987012987012988,0.16017316017316016,0,0,0,0,0,0.008658008658008658,0.030303030303030304,0,0,0.5,0.006493506493506494,0.010822510822510822,0,0.021645021645021644,0.047619047619047616,0.0021645021645021645,0,0.023809523809523808,0.015151515151515152,0.0021645021645021645,0.03463203463203463,0.004329004329004329,0.008658008658008658,0.015151515151515152,0.006493506493506494,0.0021645021645021645,0,0.0021645021645021645,0.19047619047619047,0.010822510822510822,0,0.01948051948051948,0.0367965367965368,0.06277056277056277,0.08441558441558442,0.05844155844155844,0.10822510822510822,0.14935064935064934,0.13203463203463203,0.01948051948051948,0,0.03896103896103896,0.07792207792207792,0.004329004329004329,0.004329004329004329,0.006493506493506494,0,0.006493506493506494,0,0,0.030303030303030304,0.12121212121212122,0.04329004329004329,0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.02813852813852814,0.10822510822510822,0.09740259740259741,0.01948051948051948,0.05194805194805195,0,74.425,0,1,0,4,0,3,19.5,6,4,11,7,18,0,74.425,0,111.425,3,30.5,144.925,111.425,,0.796852923264119,0,0.05006592189696456,0,0.17411239489546831,0,0.1365270594958143,0.5068401856938083,0.24025307335204216,0.17411239489546831,0.36698880992097505,0.26950373545682293,0.486832980505138,0,0.20856217852254144,0,0.19516573980820598,0.005254630643254369,0.053422078206419414,0.2538424486578798,0.8577887677466354,0.7461575513421201,36

417,"During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana. With her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her   shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break. “I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a    mother in Deltona, Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because   marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O. K. ” Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers  —   another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health. Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient  —   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  —   can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk. “There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in   pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use. In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of    said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2. 4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.) Young    were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7. 5 percent of   to    said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44. Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb. In Pittsburgh,    born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention. Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers. “Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. “Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition. ” It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I. Q. “The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ” “You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic. Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing. “I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk. ’” In a statement, C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero. “While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said. Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes. ” Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted. ” Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now. ” There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women  —   instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord  —   and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself. Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit. To find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an   at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients. Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When    admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all. Pregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture. Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of   mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant. “Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy. “If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it. ” Stacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and   and she isn’t worried about his development. She still smokes pot  —   indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now. “I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said.",0,1443,18.74025974025974,77,0.36382536382536385,0,0,0,0,89.75869715869716,24.75633806883807,73.35668745668745,11.434604723066261,0.8468468468468469,0.010395010395010396,0.04643104643104643,0.036036036036036036,0.03465003465003465,0.004158004158004158,0.18156618156618157,0.004851004851004851,0.007623007623007623,0.020097020097020097,0.0595980595980596,0.002079002079002079,0.06583506583506583,0.06791406791406791,0.008316008316008316,0.0297990297990298,0.00693000693000693,0.11850311850311851,0.001386001386001386,0.06652806652806653,0.02772002772002772,0.05474705474705475,0,0.000693000693000693,0.0297990297990298,0.009009009009009009,0.060291060291060294,0,0.019404019404019403,0.004158004158004158,0.026334026334026334,0,0.00693000693000693,0.042966042966042964,0.000693000693000693,0.000693000693000693,0.4171864171864172,0.0492030492030492,0.014553014553014554,0.000693000693000693,0.002772002772002772,0.03465003465003465,0.004158004158004158,0.01593901593901594,0.03187803187803188,0.013167013167013167,0.02356202356202356,0.004158004158004158,0.000693000693000693,0.009009009009009009,0.014553014553014554,0.022176022176022176,0.002079002079002079,0.000693000693000693,0.02702702702702703,0.23492723492723494,0.004158004158004158,0.001386001386001386,0.024255024255024255,0.05751905751905752,0.08038808038808039,0.03257103257103257,0.011088011088011088,0.02772002772002772,0.1469161469161469,0.06722106722106722,0.031185031185031187,0,0.030492030492030493,0.1288981288981289,0.000693000693000693,0.00693000693000693,0.013167013167013167,0.002079002079002079,0.004158004158004158,0,0.013167013167013167,0.015246015246015246,0.10464310464310464,0.06583506583506583,0,0.02702702702702703,0.009702009702009701,0.05266805266805267,0.1288981288981289,0.12681912681912683,0.002079002079002079,0.05474705474705475,0.002772002772002772,5.25,0,97.7,0,9.25,3.3,4,75.475,3.83,88.7,17.5,8,13,10,5.25,1,65.16,20.3,221.175,299.635,65.16,,0.11799653019622969,0,0.713436383133389,0,0.19074983428400932,0.07756888081583448,0.09250087595983508,0.6579186299019573,0.08891915547179899,0.693278376026664,0.3084089892297471,0.1693378522531012,0.24883795669515915,0.203075234310397,0.34560194536316863,0.02484914473079738,0.03933274378484095,0.012253755353472551,0.13350858819232964,0.18086965445013536,-0.8489971218525839,0.8191303455498646,86

419,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Simone Manuel woke up Friday morning to confirmation that her victory in the   freestyle a few hours earlier had not been a dream. The proof was perhaps more surreal than Thursday night’s payoff: Instagram posts from LeBron James and Serena Williams. Manuel’s friend and fellow trailblazer Lia Neal had forwarded the messages after stumbling across them on Twitter. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I wish I could see her reaction right now,’” Neal said. “She doesn’t need to hear from anyone else. Those are like her two favorite athletes. ” Manuel’s popularity got an emphatic spike after she became the first   woman to win an individual swimming event at the Olympics. Manuel, a    Texan, shared the gold medal with    Penny Oleksiak, who also made history, becoming the youngest gold medalist from Canada. James wrote that he watched the race with his daughter. Williams posted a picture of Manuel and Simone Biles, who won the gymnastics   gold medal, and called them  “amazing. ” One mother posted a photograph on Twitter of her exuberant young black daughter posing in front of a television screen that showed Manuel being interviewed. By early Friday evening, it had more than 12, 000 likes. “I saw that picture,” Neal said. “I retweeted it. I was tearing up again. ” The top of the medals podium at Olympic Aquatics Stadium was crowded Thursday night, and not because there were   medalists for the first time in the Olympics since 2000, when Anthony Ervin, whose father is   and American Indian, tied his teammate Gary Hall Jr. in the 50 freestyle. Standing on the podium with her, Manuel said, were Neal, Ervin, Maritza Correira, Cullen Jones and all the black swimmers whose success shaped Manuel’s dreams. “This medal is not just for me, it’s for some of the   that have come before me, have been inspirations and mentors to me,” Manuel said. In 2012, Neal became the second   woman to make a United States Olympic swim team, after Correia in 2004. Neal was 17 and a rising senior in high school. Neal and Correia earned medals as members of 4x100 freestyle relays in their first Olympics. Correia won a silver, Neal a bronze. On Saturday, Neal raced in the morning heat for the American 4x100 relay team, which later took the silver. Neal, a rising senior at Stanford who grew up in Brooklyn, was asked which medal she considers more precious, her silver or the gold that Manuel earned in an upset. “I think Simone’s gold,” Neal said. “I just felt more when she touched the wall and saw that she won. I knew exactly what went into winning that gold medal. ” Neal feels a sisterly bond to Manuel, who is one year behind her at Stanford. In the   to the Olympics, they often felt as if people saw their stories as being only skin deep. On the way to becoming the first two black women to grace the same United States Olympic swimming team, Neal and Manuel often compared notes after news media interviews. To their growing frustration, race was often discussed more than their races. “We talk about it and acknowledge that other people talk about it,” Neal said, “but we’re like ‘O. K. we’re here, like everyone else here we’re training toward winning, toward representing their country in the best way possible. History comes along with that. ” She added, “It’s cool because we’re not seeking to make history or change lives, we’re just doing what we love. ” Neal sat with Manuel roughly two hours before Thursday’s final. They listened to music, including the song “1, 2 Step” by Ciara and Missy Elliott. Neal’s parting words were “Pipe It Up,” from Migos. Neal said she was shaking before Manuel’s race and started crying during the last 10 meters when it dawned on her that Manuel might win. The prerace favorites were Cate Campbell of Australia, who lowered the world record to 52. 08 in July, and her sister, Bronte, who had clocked a 52. 58 in April. Manuel posted a 53. 32 in the heats, a 53. 11 in the semifinals and a 52. 70 in the final. “I was super surprised,” Manuel said after the race. “I don’t think there was a definitive point where I thought I had the race. ” How shocking was the outcome? Sarah Sjostrom, the Swede who finished third, said, “Penny and the American girl winning, I think that was the biggest surprise of the meet. ” (Never mind that “the American girl” had finished sixth, four places behind Sjostrom, in the   freestyle final at last summer’s World Championships in Kazan, Russia). After Manuel finished giving interviews in the mixed zone, she fell into the arms of Neal and another Stanford teammate, Maya DiRado. “She was just bawling,” Neal said. “She was like: ‘I’m so happy you guys are my teammates. I couldn’t have done this without you guys. I love you. ’” Manuel’s sentiments meant the world to Neal, who was disappointed when she did not qualify for these Games in an individual event. “Why I broke down in tears and why I felt so much emotion when she won was because I was there with her every step of the way,” Neal said. “I knew exactly what it took to get to that point and win a gold medal firsthand. ” How long will it take for swimming in the United States to become colorblind? Is one gold enough to change the questions Manuel and Neal face? “I think this definitely catapults us many steps forward,” Neal said, adding, “I think just that one medal will bring so many different people into the sport and inspire so many different people. ” Manuel, who on Friday qualified for Saturday’s   freestyle final, said she looked forward to the day when she is known simply as a champion. After the 100 final, she said, “I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it’s not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title ‘black swimmer’ makes it seem like I’m not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I’m not supposed to be able to break records. ”",0,1053,15.954545454545455,66,0.2630579297245964,0,0,0,0,81.76426976426976,46.752136752136764,75.60179249762582,78.07357130886543,0.8214624881291548,0.04178537511870845,0.04843304843304843,0.0389363722697056,0.04653371320037987,0.027540360873694207,0.2117758784425451,0.000949667616334283,0.001899335232668566,0.026590693257359924,0.07692307692307693,0.001899335232668566,0.06172839506172839,0.005698005698005698,0.002849002849002849,0.016144349477682812,0.008547008547008548,0.0835707502374169,0.001899335232668566,0.06932573599240266,0.037037037037037035,0.04748338081671415,0,0,0.020892687559354226,0.005698005698005698,0.08167141500474834,0,0.005698005698005698,0.006647673314339981,0.03323836657169991,0,0.003798670465337132,0.0892687559354226,0.003798670465337132,0.003798670465337132,0.46058879392212726,0.000949667616334283,0.017094017094017096,0,0.029439696106362774,0.04938271604938271,0.006647673314339981,0,0.023741690408357077,0.026590693257359924,0.023741690408357077,0.006647673314339981,0.004748338081671415,0.023741690408357077,0.012345679012345678,0.008547008547008548,0.004748338081671415,0.000949667616334283,0.03608736942070275,0.2744539411206078,0.000949667616334283,0.000949667616334283,0.039886039886039885,0.05982905982905983,0.04083570750237417,0.07597340930674264,0.037037037037037035,0.022792022792022793,0.12630579297245964,0.12535612535612536,0.016144349477682812,0.002849002849002849,0.04938271604938271,0.16334283000949668,0.000949667616334283,0.02184235517568851,0,0.004748338081671415,0.016144349477682812,0,0,0.026590693257359924,0.12060778727445394,0.0731244064577398,0,0.015194681861348529,0.008547008547008548,0.07122507122507123,0.14339981006647673,0.14814814814814814,0.008547008547008548,0.019943019943019943,0.002849002849002849,82.25,0,10,2,2.75,0,11,8,52,8,6,53.075,58,0,82.25,46,214.825,76.5,48,339.325,214.825,,0.6936140036052435,0,0.2158344610587697,0.05217599429965031,0.07036522629475098,0,0.2324018738455954,0.18045735190554077,0.5886894357248305,0.18045735190554077,0.1417374030335042,0.5936349078318922,0.6148509557476252,0,0.43524350555365154,0.55871482982184,0.16432409691545713,0.05851643623429522,0.03671619528426367,0.259556728434016,0.8665537590118533,0.740443271565984,85
420,"Email Wednesday on 800 WVHU radio’s “The Tom Roten Morning Show,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said polls showing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with a lead over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were “designed to suppress turnout.” Paul said “You know, I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout. So when Trump says the thing’s rigged, I’m not sure exactly what he means and I’m not sure I always agree with him. But I do think that when we say over and over someone can’t win, that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout.” He added, “The polls are put out, you know to make it either look closer than it is or to make it look like Democrats have a better chance. And I think it’s done by design to try to dampen turnout.”",1,152,21.714285714285715,7,0.23684210526315788,0,0,0,0,64.39292676134781,50.350877192982466,47.368421052631575,84.01754385964912,0.7631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.019736842105263157,0.03289473684210526,0.006578947368421052,0.19078947368421054,0,0,0.039473684210526314,0.046052631578947366,0.006578947368421052,0.08552631578947369,0,0,0.019736842105263157,0.02631578947368421,0.16447368421052633,0,0.039473684210526314,0.03289473684210526,0.05263157894736842,0.006578947368421052,0,0.046052631578947366,0,0.08552631578947369,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.039473684210526314,0,0,0.4605263157894737,0,0.03289473684210526,0,0.039473684210526314,0.07236842105263158,0.013157894736842105,0,0.046052631578947366,0.019736842105263157,0.006578947368421052,0.019736842105263157,0,0.013157894736842105,0.019736842105263157,0,0.006578947368421052,0,0.006578947368421052,0.2565789473684211,0,0.006578947368421052,0.06578947368421052,0.046052631578947366,0.02631578947368421,0.07894736842105263,0.03289473684210526,0.05921052631578947,0.125,0.1513157894736842,0.013157894736842105,0,0.05263157894736842,0.09868421052631579,0,0.019736842105263157,0.013157894736842105,0,0.02631578947368421,0,0,0.019736842105263157,0.07894736842105263,0.046052631578947366,0,0.03289473684210526,0,0.039473684210526314,0.19736842105263158,0.19078947368421054,0.006578947368421052,0.019736842105263157,0.013157894736842105,2,0,5,0,0,4,0,0,1.83,1,0,0,3,0,2,1,6.83,4,16,25.83,6.83,,0.14459058185587106,0,0.2970504159217058,0,0,0.252650308587072,0,0,0.13394661298843988,0.0779292055122247,0,0,0.2022631961725015,0,0,0.0779292055122247,0.04045489545696855,0.02369247171711189,0.09476988686844756,0.15299413611325002,-0.5229063707475582,0.8470058638867499,9
421,"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal ElectionsAmericans are being told by “experts” (read “Hillary supporters”) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. The entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/biggest-election-fraud-in-history-discovered-in-the-united-states/ The post How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .",1,130,21.666666666666668,6,0.3384615384615385,0,0,0,0.007692307692307693,88.89814032121724,5.756410256410256,64.985754985755,81.28274428274429,0.7615384615384615,0.06153846153846154,0.03076923076923077,0.03076923076923077,0.06153846153846154,0.007692307692307693,0.13076923076923078,0,0,0,0.1076923076923077,0,0.13076923076923078,0,0,0.046153846153846156,0.023076923076923078,0.12307692307692308,0,0.023076923076923078,0.015384615384615385,0.038461538461538464,0.007692307692307693,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.11538461538461539,0,0,0,0.007692307692307693,0,0,0.03076923076923077,0,0,0.46153846153846156,0,0,0,0,0.038461538461538464,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.007692307692307693,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0.023076923076923078,0.27692307692307694,0,0.007692307692307693,0.015384615384615385,0.06153846153846154,0.06153846153846154,0.023076923076923078,0.046153846153846156,0.03076923076923077,0.12307692307692308,0.06153846153846154,0.015384615384615385,0,0.03076923076923077,0.12307692307692308,0,0.046153846153846156,0,0,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0.007692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.05384615384615385,0,0.015384615384615385,0.007692307692307693,0.023076923076923078,0.13076923076923078,0.19230769230769232,0.007692307692307693,0.06153846153846154,0,5,0,23,0,3,0,10,0,5,37,0,2,4,0,5,0,12,10,44,66,12,,0.3133921657949117,0,0.6773780526836762,0,0.2149851662190087,0,0.4772255750516611,0,0.3133921657949117,0.7715654983556262,0,0.15438708879488486,0.2674788903885893,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,0.05555555555555555,0.24444444444444444,0.36666666666666664,-0.8051131388410014,0.6333333333333333,16
422,"Phys.org Mon, 24 Oct 2016 All the known major bacterial groups are represented by wedges in this circular ‘tree of life.’ The bigger wedges are more diverse groups. Green wedges are groups that have not been genomically sampled at the Rifle site –everything else has. Black wedges are previously identified bacteria groups that have also been found at Rifle. Purple wedges are groups discovered at Rifle and announced last year. Red wedges are new groups discovered in this study. Colored dots represent important metabolic processes the new groups help mediate. One of the most detailed genomic studies of any ecosystem to date has revealed an underground world of stunning microbial diversity, and added dozens of new branches to the tree of life. The bacterial bonanza comes from scientists who reconstructed the genomes of more than 2,500 microbes from sediment and groundwater samples collected at an aquifer in Colorado. The effort was led by researchers from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley. DNA sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. As reported online October 24 in the journal Nature Communications , the scientists netted genomes from 80 percent of all known bacterial phyla, a remarkable degree of biological diversity at one location. They also discovered 47 new phylum-level bacterial groups , naming many of them after influential microbiologists and other scientists. And they learned new insights about how microbial communities work together to drive processes that are critical to the planet’s climate and life everywhere, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles. These findings shed light on one of Earth’s most important and least understood realms of life. The subterranean world hosts up to one-fifth of all biomass, but it remains a mystery. “We didn’t expect to find this incredible microbial diversity. But then again, we know little about the roles of subsurface microbes in biogeochemical processes, and more broadly, we don’t really know what’s down there,” says Jill Banfield, a Senior Faculty Scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Climate & Ecosystem Sciences Division and a UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science, and Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. UC Berkeley’s Karthik Anantharaman, the first author of the paper, adds, “To better understand what subsurface microbes are up to, our approach is to access their entire genomes. This enabled us to discover a greater interdependency among microbes than we’ve seen before.” The research is part of a Berkeley Lab-led project called Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area 2.0, which is developing a predictive understanding of terrestrial environments from the genome to the watershed scale. The project’s field research takes place at a research site near the town of Rifle, Colorado, where for the past several years scientists have conducted experiments designed to stimulate populations of subterranean microbes that are naturally present in very low numbers. The scientists sent soil and water samples from these experiments to the Joint Genome Institute for terabase-scale metagenomic sequencing. This high-throughput method isolates and purifies DNA from environmental samples, and then sequences one trillion base pairs of DNA at a time. Next, the scientists used bioinformatics tools developed in Banfield’s lab to analyze the data. Their approach has redrawn the tree of life. Between the 47 new bacterial groups reported in this work, and 35 new groups published last year (also found at the Rifle site), Banfield’s team has doubled the number of known bacterial groups. With discovery comes naming rights. The scientists named many of the new bacteria groups after Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley researchers. For example, there’s Candidatus Andersenbacteria, after phylochip inventor Gary Andersen, and there’s Candidatus Doudnabacteria, after CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna. “Berkeley now dominates the tree of life as it does the periodic table,” Banfield says, in a nod to the sixteen elements discovered at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley. Another big outcome is a deeper understanding of the roles subsurface microbes play in globally important carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles . This information will help to better represent these cycles in predictive models such as climate simulations. The scientists conducted metabolic analyses of 36 percent of the organisms detected in the aquifer system. They focused on a phenomenon called metabolic handoff, which essentially means one microbe’s waste is another microbe’s food. It’s known from lab studies that handoffs are needed in certain reactions, but these interconnected networks are widespread and vastly more complex in the real world. To understand why it’s important to represent metabolic handoffs as accurately as possible in models, consider nitrate, a groundwater contaminant from fertilizers. Subsurface microbes are the primary driver in reducing nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. There are four steps in this denitrification process, and the third step creates nitrous oxide—one of the most potent greenhouse gases. The process breaks down if microbes that carry out the fourth step are inactive when a pulse of nitrate enters the system. “If microbes aren’t there to accept the nitrous oxide handoff, then the greenhouse gas escapes into the atmosphere,” says Anantharaman. The scientists found the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles are all driven by metabolic handoffs that require an unexpectedly high degree of interdependence among microbes. The vast majority of microorganisms can’t fully reduce a compound on their own. It takes a team. There are also backup microbes ready to perform a handoff if first-string microbes are unavailable. “The combination of high microbial diversity and interconnections through metabolic handoffs likely results in high ecosystem resilience ,” says Banfield.",1,945,21,45,0.41375661375661377,0,0,0,0,96.48376068376068,36.575634242300914,62.461493239271014,43.08761904761904,0.7005291005291006,0.013756613756613757,0.04973544973544974,0.027513227513227514,0.01904761904761905,0.026455026455026454,0.14814814814814814,0.0021164021164021165,0,0.022222222222222223,0.08253968253968254,0,0.04656084656084656,0.010582010582010581,0.0010582010582010583,0.01164021164021164,0.009523809523809525,0.08253968253968254,0,0.050793650793650794,0.027513227513227514,0.04973544973544974,0.007407407407407408,0,0.015873015873015872,0.005291005291005291,0.06878306878306878,0,0,0,0,0,0.007407407407407408,0.02857142857142857,0.0010582010582010583,0.0010582010582010583,0.37566137566137564,0.006349206349206349,0.005291005291005291,0,0,0.03492063492063492,0,0.0021164021164021165,0.03597883597883598,0.009523809523809525,0.0031746031746031746,0,0,0.015873015873015872,0.005291005291005291,0.004232804232804233,0,0,0.02857142857142857,0.2052910052910053,0.0031746031746031746,0.0021164021164021165,0.016931216931216932,0.050793650793650794,0.06243386243386243,0.013756613756613757,0.013756613756613757,0.025396825396825397,0.13968253968253969,0.04867724867724868,0.044444444444444446,0,0.01164021164021164,0.14285714285714285,0,0.009523809523809525,0.0010582010582010583,0.0021164021164021165,0.010582010582010581,0,0,0,0.04656084656084656,0.08148148148148149,0,0.010582010582010581,0.007407407407407408,0.0455026455026455,0.09947089947089947,0.0835978835978836,0.006349206349206349,0.061375661375661375,0,40.125,0,4,0,3,5,0,7.625,3.83,7,14,1,8,0,40.125,0,71.27499999999999,5,23.625,92.89999999999999,71.27499999999999,,0.5721925133689839,0,0.11764705882352941,0,0.09090909090909091,0.14285714285714285,0,0.2026578073089701,0.1132131244457582,0.1891891891891892,0.3181818181818182,0.03225806451612903,0.21052631578947367,0,0.15789473684210525,0,0.07142499248421685,0.005010522096402445,0.023674716905501554,0.09309550055115742,0.6919515448415662,0.9069044994488425,40
423,"Over the past few months, relations between the United States and the Russian Federation have sunk to their lowest levels since the Cold War with bitter insults and threats being thrown around on both sides of the divide. However, the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States seems to have brought some change to this dangerous situation.Trump and Putin vow to fight Islamic State together The president -elect and the Russian President Vladimir Putin have confirmed that they have had a healthy and productive conversation regarding relations between the countries and their shared purpose in tackling global terrorism. The telephone call was instigated by Putin who wanted to express his congratulations to Trump after he took the top job in American politics. During the conversation, Putin is reported to have said that he is ready to pick up a dialogue with officials from the United States “by mutual respect, non-intervention into each other’s internal affairs”.The two men agreed during their brief telephone call that they would lay the groundwork to bring in a new era of Russia-American cooperation. According to a source, Putin and Trump have agreed to “work to channel bilateral relationships into constructive cooperation, to combine efforts to tackle international terrorism and extremism, and to continue contact by telephone and to work towards meeting in person” . Trump’s office continued with this optimism and placatory stance saying: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.""In a follow-up statement, a Kremlin spokesperson said that the United States and Russia were planning to work together in both trade and economics as well as the threat posed by international terrorist organizations such as Islamic State. The fight against Islamic State may prove to be of essential importance in the coming months as top Islamic State commanders have already expressed their intention to exploit Donald Trump’s outspoken opinions on ordinary Muslims.

424,"Russia may run out of patience and respond to USA's rudeness 28.10.2016 AP photo Russian President Putin said at the meeting of the Valdai Club in Sochi that Washington has not been able to distinguish between terrorists and moderate opposition in Syria, despite many promises to do so. As a result, the truce was terminated, and the White House accuses the Kremlin of all mortal sins. ""This is simply a disgrace. We behave with restraint and we do not respond in such a rude way to our partners, but everything has its limits. We may respond,"" Putin warned. Pravda.Ru asked an expert opinion about the possible development of events from specialist on US-Russia relations, Victor Olevich. ""How can Putin respond?"" ""Russia has a whole arsenal of potential responses. At the moment, Russia is keeping a pause in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Russian Federation is not using its full military capability to resolve the Syrian crisis. ""If the United States continues to engage in further provocations against Russia and Russian interests , then, of course, Moscow will take more active measures to counter what remains, in fact, a terrorist threat in Syria."" Print version Font Size ""Putin mentioned during his speech that ""our personal agreements with the US president did not work."" He added that there were forces in Washington that did their best not to let them work. What kind of forces are they?"" ""First of all, this is the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies: the CIA and some others that have, indeed, made every effort to bury the agreements between Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry that they had reached in Geneva. ""As you know, a few days after the agreement on Syria between Moscow and Washington was reached, the US military accidentally bombed one of the most combat-ready Syrian military bases near Deir ez-Zor. The bombing continued for an hour. Up to 80 Syrian military men were killed, and many more were injured. Of course, one could not talk about any agreements afterwards. ""Moreover, when Russia raised the issue at the UN Security Council, US Representative Samantha Power reacted very sharply, and, indeed, in a rude way. A few days later, a humanitarian convoy in Aleppo was attacked, and the United States and their Western allies presented totally unsubstantiated and groundless accusations against Russia again. ""It was clear that Pentagon chief Ashton Carter, a number of American generals and the CIA were not interested in a joint struggle against the terrorist threat in Syria. Jabhat en-Nusra serves as a reserve of the United States that the country uses when necessary to topple Syrian President Assad.

426,"ISTANBUL  —   Turkey’s quarrel with Europe worsened over the weekend after the Turkish president accused the Dutch government of Nazism, and Turkish politicians were barred or disinvited from events in two European countries, amid tensions ahead of a tight referendum on a new Turkish Constitution. Having criticized German officials for barring their Turkish counterparts from campaign events this month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan turned his ire on the Netherlands after the Dutch stopped the Turkish foreign minister from landing there for a rally on Saturday, and then escorted the Turkish family minister out of the country early on Sunday, citing risks to public order and security. It was an unusually strong reaction from the Dutch, who have generally taken an open stance toward diverse points of view, but who are in the midst of an election campaign in which immigration and integration are major topics. “When those incidents began, I said those are fascistic measures,” Mr. Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday afternoon. “I said Nazism had risen from the dead. And then I added: I thought Nazism was over, but I was wrong. ” The   remarks from Turkey inflamed tensions among the Turkish community in the Netherlands, who protested in Rotterdam until the early hours of Sunday, when they were dispersed by police officers wielding batons and water cannons. The police arrested 12 people, and seven were injured, including a policeman, whose hand was broken. Though Turkish law technically bars the practice, Turkish ministers are touring Europe to persuade the Continent’s sizable Turkish diaspora to vote yes to an expansion of Mr. Erdogan’s powers, amid fears that the “no” campaign may hold the edge in the April referendum. But this campaign has collided with closely fought local elections in the Netherlands and France, where   politicians have sought political capital from stoking tensions with the Turks. The push for votes also comes at a time of increased European alarm over Turkey’s democratic backslide and rising concerns over immigration and integration. The Dutch government said it refused to allow the Turkish foreign minister’s plane to land after the Turkish government publicly called on “Dutch nationals of Turkish origin to turn out in great numbers. ” The two countries were negotiating over finding a smaller venue like the Turkish Consulate to hold the meeting, but “before these talks had been concluded,” Turkey “publicly threatened the Netherlands with sanctions” making a “reasonable compromise” impossible, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said. Elsewhere in Europe, the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, canceled a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Binali Yildirim, in protest of Turkey’s “rhetorical attacks. ” In Sweden, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan’s party, Mehdi Eker, rearranged a campaign event after the meeting’s initial hosts backed out for safety reasons. In France, two   candidates, François Fillon and Marine Le Pen, criticized the decision to allow the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to proceed with a rally in France. Switzerland and Austria have previously made it clear that Mr. Erdogan’s campaign is unwelcome there. In the Netherlands, both the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte, and his   opponent, Geert Wilders, hoped to benefit from the dispute, though it was not immediately clear if either would see appreciable gains. The election is on Wednesday, and while it was Mr. Wilders who first elevated the issue publicly, Mr. Rutte could get credit for barring the Turkish ministers. “Rutte now has premier bonus,” said Bianca Pander, a political strategist at BKB, which works on campaign strategy, referring to his status as prime minister. “He can now show what leadership means. ” He is also benefiting from nearly constant news media coverage on the issue. “Rutte is in the picture now: He’s on every TV show, and on every newspaper,” Ms. Pander said. Mr. Rutte said the pejoratives leveled at the Dutch were “bizarre” and that the “Turkish republic is moving in the wrong direction for a democracy. ” In response, Mr. Erdogan accused the   Dutch government of playing to a domestic audience by blocking his ministers. “Holland, if you are sacrificing   relations because of the election on Wednesday, you will pay the price,” Mr. Erdogan said Sunday. Inside Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, too, was accused of trying to curry favor with the country’s voters. With the referendum result in doubt, some of the president’s critics argued that he was manufacturing fights with Europe to win the support of nationalists in Turkey who were undecided about whether to back the expansion of his mandate. “Turkish foreign policy today  —   whatever it is, wherever it is, from Syria all the way to the Netherlands and Germany  —   is related to the domestic political agenda,” said Cengiz Candar, a veteran Turkish columnist and academic. “There is no Turkish foreign policy now,” Mr. Candar added in a telephone interview. “Turkish foreign policy is related to Mr. Erdogan’s referendum campaign. ” But others supported Mr. Erdogan’s stance. The leader of the main Turkish opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is against the proposed Constitution, called on Mr. Erdogan to suspend relations with the Netherlands. A small crowd of   protesters gathered outside the Dutch Consulate in Istanbul, while an unknown intruder briefly managed to replace the consulate’s Dutch flag with a Turkish one. In a province west of the city, another crowd of protesters squeezed a series of oranges, in a theatrical gesture apparently intended to insult the Dutch, whose national color is orange. Arriving back in Turkey after her deportation, the Turkish family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, accused the Netherlands of hypocrisy for claiming to stand up for human rights while restricting her own. “We faced a very inhumane, unethical treatment,” she said at Istanbul’s main airport, according to Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. “We had a really very painful night in Holland, which talks about democracy, freedoms, freedom of speech. ” In addition to targeting wavering members of Mr. Erdogan’s own party, some analysts said the Turkish government’s movements in Europe were particularly aimed at supporters of the country’s largest nationalist movement, the Nationalist Movement Party, which is known in Turkey as the M. H. P. The M. H. P. has traditionally been wary of Mr. Erdogan, but its leadership now supports giving him more power, in the private expectation that its own cadres will subsequently be rewarded with more influence. While an estimated three million German residents are of Turkish origin, as well as about 400, 000 Dutch residents, the number of people in Germany and the Netherlands who are eligible to vote in the Turkish elections is far lower, said Alexander Clarkson, a specialist on the Turkish diaspora at King’s College London. Mr. Erdogan’s recent gestures were therefore primarily targeted at the M. H. P. ’s rank and file in Turkey, many of whom are skeptical of their leadership’s alliance with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Clarkson said. “The audience isn’t really the diaspora the audience is at home,” Mr. Clarkson said of the government’s stance toward the Netherlands and Germany. The heated language helps achieve this goal, Mr. Clarkson said, since “it enables Erdogan and the A. K. P. to say: We are out there protecting the rights of Turks abroad. ” The A. K. P. is an acronym for Mr. Erdogan’s group, the Justice and Development Party. Mr. Erdogan was accused of hypocrisy for criticizing Europe’s perceived authoritarianism while overseeing a sweeping crackdown on dissent in his country. Since a failed coup in July, Mr. Erdogan’s government has ruled mostly by decree, allowing it to suspend or fire more than 120, 000 government employees, and arrest an estimated 45, 000 people suspected of being dissidents or rebels. The detainees come from a broad section of public life and include soldiers, police officers, teachers, judges, academics, journalists and lawmakers. “He is the president of a country,” Mr. Candar said of Mr. Erdogan, “where more than 150 journalists,   writers, columnists, opinion makers are in prison. And the leaders of the   caucus in the Turkish Parliament”  —   as well as 12 other members of Parliament who belong to it  —   “are also in prison. ” Turkey, Mr. Candar argued, “has transformed into a republic of fear. ”",0,1365,20.681818181818183,66,0.4,0,0,0,0,97.74132418641089,21.129785247432302,77.25008325008325,24.605311355311354,0.726007326007326,0.01611721611721612,0.034432234432234435,0.030036630036630037,0.041025641025641026,0.01611721611721612,0.21245421245421245,0.009523809523809525,0.006593406593406593,0.020512820512820513,0.09963369963369964,0.002197802197802198,0.05054945054945055,0.005128205128205128,0.0014652014652014652,0.014652014652014652,0.004395604395604396,0.06593406593406594,0.002197802197802198,0.08131868131868132,0.017582417582417582,0.04542124542124542,0,0.0007326007326007326,0.017582417582417582,0.005128205128205128,0.12747252747252746,0,0.0014652014652014652,0.003663003663003663,0.0029304029304029304,0,0.005128205128205128,0.041025641025641026,0,0,0.4205128205128205,0.0029304029304029304,0.01611721611721612,0.005860805860805861,0.003663003663003663,0.0315018315018315,0.003663003663003663,0.0014652014652014652,0.018315018315018316,0.01684981684981685,0.008791208791208791,0.030036630036630037,0.0029304029304029304,0.012454212454212455,0.0029304029304029304,0.020512820512820513,0.0014652014652014652,0.0014652014652014652,0.012454212454212455,0.16043956043956045,0.003663003663003663,0,0.02857142857142857,0.06813186813186813,0.0673992673992674,0.021245421245421246,0.01978021978021978,0.09084249084249084,0.15384615384615385,0.05274725274725275,0.013186813186813187,0,0.03663003663003663,0.1391941391941392,0.009523809523809525,0.008791208791208791,0.00805860805860806,0.0014652014652014652,0.007326007326007326,0,0,0.011721611721611722,0.09523809523809523,0.08424908424908426,0,0.01391941391941392,0.002197802197802198,0.04322344322344322,0.09157509157509157,0.08644688644688645,0.002197802197802198,0.04249084249084249,0.0014652014652014652,19,0,172.875,4,2,3,17,51.125,5.83,124.875,39.25,17,26.625,32.40625,19,0,96.705,20,305.40625,409.11125000000004,96.705,,0.3433829830388197,0,0.8263354560595557,0.09917731364776043,0.05217599429965031,0.07627415159993112,0.31875913892908664,0.5845742985799216,0.13827681485226723,0.7746261119784156,0.5193048828340332,0.31875913892908664,0.4229090138473961,0.4714455530342765,0.606508239012382,0,0.05825212015158623,0.012047385378540144,0.1839673395382388,0.24643604457231408,-0.8903951654601524,0.753563955427686,114

428,"One of the more interesting lessons Democrats may learn in their newfound enthusiasm for George Orwell’s Nineteen    —   which is a critique of socialism, but never mind  —   is the way that totalitarian societies destroy intimate relationships. [In the dystopian future envisioned by Orwell, children betray their parents to the Thought Police, and sex is discouraged because it creates relationships outside the state. A secret love is the most revolutionary act  —   and, ultimately, a futile one.  Today, in the United States, we are witnesses to  —   and participants in  —   the destruction of friendships and relationships over political disputes that rage uncontrollably on social media, carry over into the workplace, and even continue into the home. A few weeks ago, a   poll revealed that 39% of Americans had argued about politics with friends and family, and   had “stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election. ” True, 40% of respondents said they had not had those kinds of arguments, but that may also be because Americans are increasingly withdrawing into political camps. It is fashionable, especially in Washington, to blame these divisions on an increasingly partisan media. And that is partly true. Orwell observed  —   separately, in 1944  —   that modern innovations in communication and travel had inspired new ways to divide people, rather than bringing the world together. Of radio, for example, he observed: “It is nonsense to say that the radio puts people in touch with foreign countries   …     each national radio is a sort of totalitarian world of its own, braying propaganda night and day to people who can listen to nothing else. ” The same is true of social media and domestic politics today. Theoretically, Facebook and Twitter ought to make it easier for us to communicate with, and understand, people with different views. In practice, they encourage us to huddle with   people and sever relations with the other side. Twitter is the most brutal of social media platforms, because it allows people to bash each other from behind pseudonyms and avatars. But Facebook is even more damaging, because it takes   associations  —   families, schools, towns  —   and exposes them to the ravages of intense political debate. On Twitter, we form alliances with strangers who agree with us on Facebook, we discover the opposing political views of people with whom we may have shared close lifelong connections. Social media platforms are increasingly important sources of news. And so the new political divisions in the world of journalism are filtering into our social media, which in turn exacerbates those media divisions in a seemingly endless feedback loop. But the media are not solely responsible. The deliberate politicization of intimacy began with a specific campaign  —   namely, President Barack Obama’s 2008 run, which used social media technology to drive a political message. Obama told his supporters explicitly to approach their neighbors and “argue with them, and get in their face. ” His surrogates took that approach even further. Hollywood celebrity Sarah Silverman encouraged Obama’s Jewish supporters to travel to Florida and tell their ostensibly racist grandparents to vote for him. Later, once Obama was in office, the supposedly   Rock the Vote organization told young people to withhold sex from partners who refused to support Obamacare. The politicization of intimacy has been a Democratic campaign strategy ever since. And after the 2016 election, it has only continued. Anecdotally, conservative acquantances report that their (understandably) frustrated and (irrationally) fearful liberal Facebook friends have tried to hold them personally responsible for every perceived misstep by President Donald Trump. As much as conservatives disliked Barack Obama and his policies, that kind of behavior seemed far less common. Just recently, a friend posted on Facebook: “I got blocked by a liberal tonight. My brother. ” This quiet dissolution of American social life should worry us, for the simple reason that the intimate connections among neighbors, family, and friends are the glue that holds our otherwise individualistic society together. Alexis de Tocqueville noted in Democracy in America, nearly 200 years ago, that our system functions because of the overlapping associations we form with one another. Those are at risk. Fifteen years ago, Americans were deeply divided over the results of the 2000 presidential election and the Florida recount. It took the horrific events of September 11th, 2001 to bring the nation together. One hopes it does not take a similar event this time. This week, in addressing Congress, President Trump united the nation in applauding and comforting the widow of a fallen Navy SEAL.

429,"From a single gust of wind, Clare Hollingworth reaped the journalistic scoop of the century. Ms. Hollingworth, the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, who died on Tuesday in Hong Kong at 105, was less than a week into her first job, as a reporter for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, on that windy day in 1939. Driving alone on the road from Gleiwitz, then in Germany, to Katowice, in Poland  —   a distance of less than 20 miles  —   she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view. Through the opening, Ms. Hollingworth saw, she later wrote, “large numbers of troops, literally hundreds of tanks, armored cars and field guns” concealed in the valley. She knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion. Hastening back across the border to the Polish side, she telephoned her editor with the news, a world exclusive. The date was Aug. 28, 1939, and her article, published the next day, would become, as the British paper The Guardian wrote in 2015, “probably the greatest scoop of modern times. ” On Sept. 1, Hitler’s forces invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II. For the next four decades, Ms. Hollingworth (who over the years contributed articles to The Telegraph, The Guardian, The International Herald Tribune and The Wall Street Journal) covered World War II from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and North Africa the Greek and Algerian civil wars hostilities between Arabs and Jews in the waning days of the British mandate in Palestine and the Vietnam War, among other conflicts. Often under fire, occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy  —   both by local governments and by the British  —   Ms. Hollingworth was friend, or foe, to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury. She obtained the first interview with Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after he became the shah of Iran in 1941, and what was very likely among the last, after he was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. In 1965, wanting to cover hostilities between India and Pakistan but discovering that reporters were barred from the front, she simply secured permission from an old acquaintance, Indira Gandhi, who was then India’s minister of information and broadcasting. Ms. Hollingworth was also one of the first Western journalists to report regularly from China, opening The Telegraph’s Beijing bureau in 1973. Her other major scoops included a 1963 article for The Guardian in which she cautiously identified the British intelligence agent Kim Philby as the   “third man” in the ring of Soviet spies then known to include the Englishmen Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. Another was a 1968 article for The Telegraph in which she reported the United States’ incipient plans for peace talks with Vietnam. (The talks opened in Paris later that year and were concluded in 1973.) Ms. Hollingworth was never so happy, she often said, as when she was roaming the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. Embedded long before the term was applied to journalists, she slept in trucks and in trenches, at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights. She once held off an armed Algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe. Had her eyesight not begun to fail some 20 years ago, it was a life, Ms. Hollingworth made clear, that she would gladly have continued to the end of her days. “I must admit that I enjoy being in a war,” she told The Telegraph in 2011, on the eve of her 100th birthday. In 1989, though nearly 80 and nominally retired, Ms. Hollingworth, attired in a safari suit, her working uniform of choice for 60 years, was spotted in Tiananmen Square shinnying up a lamppost for a bird’  view of the government’s violent crackdown against civilian protesters. She periodically slept on the floor of her home in Hong Kong well into her 90s, just to keep from going soft. Through all her travels, with all their attendant rigors, there was only one thing, Ms. Hollingworth said, that she truly could not abide. “I do not mind not washing for a week or more,” she wrote, “but I do hate getting fleas in my hair. ” Her Graham Greene existence, with its typewriter, revolver and most particularly its fleas, was a far cry from the life her conventional,   British parents had envisioned for her  —   one of quiet propriety, dutiful wifehood, charity balls and hunting. Clare Hollingworth was born on Oct. 10, 1911, in Knighton in central England, outside Leicester. As a child, she enjoyed touring the historic battlefields of England and France with her father, who ran the family’s boot and shoe factory. At her parents’ insistence, the young Ms. Hollingworth attended domestic science college in Leicester, an experience that did nothing to make the prospect of hearth and home attractive. (“Although it is useful to be able to make an omelet,” she later wrote, “my domestic science training caused me to hate having anything to do with housework. ”) Partly in deference to her upbringing, she became engaged “to a suitable young man,” though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist. “My mother thought journalism frightfully low, like a trade,” Ms. Hollingworth said in the 2011 interview with The Telegraph. “She didn’t believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen’s entrance. ” In the 1930s, Ms. Hollingworth attended the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London and afterward studied at the University of Zagreb, then in Yugoslavia. Working for the League of Nations Union, a peace and social justice group established in Britain in 1918, she was dispatched to Warsaw. There, in early 1939, she aided thousands of refugees from the Sudetenland  —   the region of Czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the Nazis in October 1938  —   arranging travel documents that would let them cross into Poland. She wrote about their plight for small publications in Britain. The Telegraph learned of Ms. Hollingworth’s work in Poland, and on Aug. 25, 1939, while she was visiting London, it hired her as a correspondent. Assigned to cover the prelude to war in the region, she flew to Warsaw the next day. From Warsaw she traveled to Katowice, commandeering an official car from the British consul general there. It was in that car, Union Jack boldly flying, that she drove over the border, past astonished Nazi guards and into Germany on Aug. 28. Ms. Hollingworth’s scoop comprised two parts. The first was her story of Aug. 29, about the advent of war. The second was her report on the start of the war itself. Awakened by explosions at dawn on Sept. 1, Ms. Hollingworth, from her quarters in Katowice, saw German bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance. She telephoned a friend at the British Embassy in Warsaw. “The war has begun!” she cried. “Are you sure, old girl?” he said. Her published article notwithstanding, Ms. Hollingworth later wrote, British officialdom persisted in thinking that war remained weeks away. She held the receiver out the window as German tanks roared outside. The embassy was persuaded and soon, too, was her editor. Ms. Hollingworth’s article on the start of hostilities appeared in The Telegraph the next day. Her work from this period is unbylined  —   few reporters were accorded bylines then  —   a state of affairs she pronounced as being for the best: It simultaneously spared her parents familial anxiety and social indignity. What followed was more than 40 years of chasing danger, for it was in the most dangerous places, Ms. Hollingworth often said, that the best stories lay. Traveling with British troops in North Africa, she was buried in the sands for the night when she awoke to the sounds of a German reconnaissance party. “A sneeze would have brought death to us all,” she later wrote. She held her breath in the darkness, and the party passed unseeing. In Vietnam, a sniper’s bullet narrowly missed her head. Ms. Hollingworth’s first husband, Vandeleur Robinson, whom she married in 1936, divorced her for desertion 15 years later. (“When I’m on a story, I’m on a story  —   to hell with husband, family, anyone else,” she told The Guardian in 2004.) Her second husband, Geoffrey Hoare, a journalist whom she married in the early 1950s, died in 1965. Her death was confirmed by Patrick Garrett, her grandnephew and her biographer. Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Hilary Sandre. Over time, some members of the British press grew alienated by what they saw as Ms. Hollingworth’s imperious manner. “Ms. Hollingworth’s snobberies are very tiring, her cozy relations with British embassies irritating,” the English journalist Robert Fisk wrote, reviewing her 1990 memoir, “Front Line. ” But she remained a widely admired, even venerated, figure, a recipient of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and a perennial fixture at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong, where she had made her home since the early 1980s. Her other books include “The Three Weeks’ War in Poland” (1940) “There’s a German Just Behind Me” (1942) “The Arabs and the West” (1952) and “Mao and the Men Against Him” (1985). As Ms. Hollingworth made clear in later interviews, though there was no dearth of wars to accompany her old age, she did not truly expect to be called upon to cover them. Yet to the end of her life she slept with her passport and a pair of shoes within easy reach, just in case.",0,1652,21.17948717948718,78,0.30811138014527845,0,0,0,0,96.80231487640688,13.370460048426153,81.64694718932007,17.03427081393183,0.7869249394673123,0.010290556900726392,0.04055690072639225,0.026634382566585957,0.03753026634382567,0.017554479418886198,0.1937046004842615,0.014527845036319613,0.002421307506053269,0.013317191283292978,0.09806295399515738,0,0.04418886198547216,0.010895883777239709,0.007869249394673124,0.005447941888619854,0.007869249394673124,0.05871670702179177,0.0006053268765133172,0.08292978208232446,0.022397094430992737,0.043583535108958835,0,0.011501210653753027,0.016343825665859565,0.006053268765133172,0.07445520581113801,0.0006053268765133172,0.009685230024213076,0.004842615012106538,0.06900726392251816,0,0.007263922518159807,0.06234866828087167,0.003026634382566586,0.003026634382566586,0.4648910411622276,0.003026634382566586,0.006053268765133172,0.005447941888619854,0.006658595641646489,0.02784503631961259,0.0012106537530266344,0,0.013317191283292978,0.009079903147699757,0.006658595641646489,0.00847457627118644,0.0018159806295399517,0.012106537530266344,0.005447941888619854,0.021791767554479417,0,0.0006053268765133172,0.03934624697336562,0.1900726392251816,0.006053268765133172,0.004842615012106538,0.019975786924939468,0.059322033898305086,0.05569007263922518,0.06779661016949153,0.015738498789346248,0.0423728813559322,0.16767554479418886,0.09564164648910412,0.011501210653753027,0.0006053268765133172,0.025423728813559324,0.1694915254237288,0.002421307506053269,0.002421307506053269,0.006658595641646489,0.00423728813559322,0.007869249394673124,0,0,0.056295399515738496,0.11803874092009685,0.09685230024213075,0.0006053268765133172,0.013317191283292978,0.0036319612590799033,0.061138014527845036,0.09322033898305085,0.0950363196125908,0.0006053268765133172,0.031476997578692496,0.0006053268765133172,28,0,143.85500000000002,17.25,31,8.45,11,24,12.125,134.10500000000002,24,37.725,23.725,0,28,1,141.57500000000002,20.45,227.355,372.25500000000005,141.57500000000002,,0.414834263988871,0,0.7845844561733727,0.30398170935633384,0.43973605142596484,0.17623686619279044,0.21783543327233704,0.37797159307958533,0.23488122663047062,0.7724860728326474,0.37797159307958533,0.4885276275226662,0.37526591693071354,0,0.5990040168352333,0.02469328756655741,0.0731557339988787,0.01056708289088518,0.11748064208592665,0.19235449591914244,-0.754385248434969,0.8076455040808576,89
430,"A black man said the police in North Miami, Fla. shot him on Monday as he tried to help a patient with autism who had run away from the group home where he works. The man, Charles Kinsey, 47, who identified himself as a caretaker of the patient, was on a city street with the patient when officers arrived, a lawyer for Mr. Kinsey said. When the officers drew their weapons, Mr. Kinsey told them there was no need for firearms, lay down in the middle of the street and tried to explain what had happened, the lawyer said. The video shows him trying to calm the patient, urging him to sit and to lie down. “All he has is a toy truck  —   a toy truck,” Mr. Kinsey said, according to video obtained by the Miami television station WSVN. “I am a behavior therapist at a group home,” he added. But then an officer opened fire, striking Mr. Kinsey in the leg. The North Miami police did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment on Thursday. The North Miami police chief, Gary Eugene, who held a news conference on Thursday, said an investigation would be led by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Chief Eugene said, “The law requires us to gather every fact and resolve every question. ” No gun was recovered at the scene, he added. On Friday, North Miami leaders identified the officer as Jonathan Aledda, a member of the SWAT team, and said he had been placed on administrative leave without pay, according to The Miami Herald. Another officer was also placed on leave for allegedly giving misleading statements during the inquiry. In a preliminary statement Tuesday, the North Miami Police Department said officers had responded to a call about “an armed male suspect threatening suicide. ” “Arriving officers attempted to negotiate with the two men on the scene, one of whom was later identified as suffering from autism,” the statement said. “At some point during the   negotiation, one of the responding officers discharged his weapon. The video shows Mr. Kinsey in a   and shorts with his back on the ground and his hands in the air. Seated next to him on a street is another man, who Mr. Kinsey says is the patient he was trying to help. Mr. Kinsey tried to defuse the situation, his lawyer, Hilton Napoleon, said. “He asked the police officer, ‘Why did you shoot me?’ He told my client, ‘I don’t know,’” Mr. Napoleon said. Clint Bower, the president and chief executive of MACtown Inc. where Mr. Kinsey works, expressed frustration at how the police responded, but praised Mr. Kinsey for his actions. “Needless to say, after viewing the video, my employee Charles Kinsey, behavioral support professional, is a hero. He saved the    young man with autism from being shot,” Mr. Bower said in an email on Wednesday. “He put his own life at risk, which is evident in the video. ” Mr. Napoleon said he met with city officials on Wednesday and had discussed the possibility of a settlement. Whatever the resolution, he said, the city should start by censuring the officer. “The best thing that the City of North Miami can do is come out and condemn the officer,” he said. . In a statement on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said: “We have to stem the tide of violence, both nationwide and here in Florida. It starts with holding people accountable for their actions. There must be a thorough and independent investigation into this shooting that covers both whether officers violated internal use of deadly force policies and whether criminal charges should be brought. ”",0,610,17.941176470588236,34,0.3081967213114754,0,0,0,0,96.74397405872816,13.66025184129247,93.20004150238638,23.21311475409836,0.8491803278688524,0.022950819672131147,0.019672131147540985,0.021311475409836064,0.027868852459016394,0.019672131147540985,0.2,0.00819672131147541,0.003278688524590164,0.004918032786885246,0.11639344262295082,0,0.05573770491803279,0.00819672131147541,0.003278688524590164,0.011475409836065573,0.009836065573770493,0.06721311475409836,0.001639344262295082,0.07868852459016394,0.013114754098360656,0.04262295081967213,0,0.001639344262295082,0.009836065573770493,0.00819672131147541,0.12950819672131147,0,0,0.003278688524590164,0,0,0.001639344262295082,0.07704918032786885,0,0,0.4540983606557377,0.003278688524590164,0.03114754098360656,0.003278688524590164,0.00819672131147541,0.02459016393442623,0,0.001639344262295082,0.022950819672131147,0.02622950819672131,0.01639344262295082,0.07049180327868852,0.006557377049180328,0.021311475409836064,0.00819672131147541,0.014754098360655738,0,0,0.006557377049180328,0.2081967213114754,0.001639344262295082,0,0.04918032786885246,0.07377049180327869,0.07377049180327869,0.05901639344262295,0.013114754098360656,0.09016393442622951,0.14426229508196722,0.08360655737704918,0.019672131147540985,0.001639344262295082,0.03770491803278689,0.15245901639344261,0,0.006557377049180328,0.003278688524590164,0.001639344262295082,0.014754098360655738,0,0,0.040983606557377046,0.17049180327868851,0.09836065573770492,0,0.00819672131147541,0.004918032786885246,0.03442622950819672,0.13114754098360656,0.1360655737704918,0.003278688524590164,0.05245901639344262,0.001639344262295082,15,0,52,0,10,0,0,6,2.83,43,16,2,4,0,15,0,45.83,0,104,144.82999999999998,45.83,,0.36516954793881085,0,0.6660108200187002,0,0.2771863727725965,0,0,0.18705102131189996,0.0979008073572611,0.6224954544954187,0.38025696682304133,0.07123316455861123,0.13299282904102766,0,0.4686531210506204,0,0.06402358101783943,0,0.1452858919017085,0.20232457427042733,-0.7593093825310443,0.7976754257295726,39
431," The Path to Total Dictatorship: America's Shadow Government and Its Silent CoupBy John W. Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state . The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government . This group is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable. Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.Say hello to Americas shadow government.A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe. COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstancesa terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdownto bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.Yet it is the second shadow government also referred to as the Deep Statethat poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government.The Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power, makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.So who or what is the Deep State?Its the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. Its the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies : the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.Its every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.These are the key players that drive the shadow government.This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.Domestic surveillance.No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether youre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alikeincluding homes. Coupled with the nations growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.Global spying.The NSAs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion  espionage empire , will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage .Roving TSA searches.The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.USA Patriot Act, NDAA.Americas so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.Militarized police state.Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, Americas law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.SWAT team raids.With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.Domestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.School-to-prison pipeline.The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.Overcriminalization.The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.Privatized Prisons.States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.Endless wars.Americas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.Are you getting the message yet?The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going on.As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue , is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.The Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater) and Silicon Valley.This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.As Lofgren concludes:[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officialselected and unelected alikeare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by Americas shadow government.Constitutional attorney and author John W.

432,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself Americans are today being given a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. According to experts, today’s vote is less an opportunity to select the leader of the free world, so much as the chance to remind Donald Trump what an arsehole they all think he is. Democratic countries around the globe are today united in telling Americans they have a unique chance to show the world that they have the ability to guide a leading nation in the direction of societal harmony, equality for all, and telling racists to go fuck themselves. US political expert, Chuck Williams, told us, “Setting the persuasive policy arguments made by the candidates to one side, the United States will wake on Wednesday morning to either of two plausible realities. “One in which the downcast misogynist billionaire leader has been roundly told to fuck the fuck off, or another in which he enjoys a prolonged, ill-tempered orgasm on the Fox News network.” Williams urged Americans to imagine a forward-looking country in which Donald Trump isn’t constantly forced to appear on the news in order to defend himself against accusation after inevitable accusation of improper behaviour, both privately and professionally. He concluded, “You can either offer a number of quiet ‘fuck you’s at him many, many times over the next four years, or you can give him one enormous one today. “Choose wisely.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

433,"Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations. On Friday, Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force, and the mayor said he would negotiate a   settlement, known as a consent decree. But that is no guarantee of results  —   and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing reports choking with outrage. Los Angeles, which was under a consent decree for 11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. “Los Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank. In Detroit, which emerged from a   consent decree last year, officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly. But Pittsburgh, the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a “pattern and practice” of misconduct, later backslid after changes in leadership, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement, the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms, underscoring some experts’ view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements. Last year, Miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision, training and internal investigations. The “pattern and practice” approach developed after the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable. A jury’s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on Mr. King incited deadly riots. Since the early attempts, Mr. Walker said, consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive. “The general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues,” he said, “but I don’t think there’s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before. ” Still, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general under   Donald J. Trump, called them “dangerous,” writing in 2008 that they “constitute an end run around the democratic process. ” At his confirmation hearing this past week, he softened that critique, saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced. But, Mr. Sessions said, lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,” he said. His critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work. But experts say that even systemic changes, like greater oversight of officers’ use of force, can be slow to yield results. “They change the ‘inputs’ through training, record keeping, community involvement and other internal reforms, but the inputs don’t necessarily translate into changes in ‘outputs’ including racial disparities, use of force, or other constitutional issues,” wrote Jeff Fagan, a Columbia University law professor, in an email. “The results have been quite variable. ” Consent decrees can span years and many of the Obama administration’s key settlements have just begun, including those in Cleveland and Albuquerque. So it would be premature to assess their success. Some reform advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees, robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change. Even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees. Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said that a consent decree would aid community relations. Charles H. Ramsey, who as Washington’s police chief invited the Justice Department to review his department, said, “The DOJ gives legitimacy to the changes that you’re making. ” Chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change, as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms. Mr. Sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy. “Such decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money,” he wrote. “Thus, the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process. ”",0,827,22.97222222222222,36,0.4062877871825877,0,0,0,0,92.31453533778243,6.890081071842204,64.17618343857764,45.77443958701516,0.7605804111245466,0.019347037484885126,0.03869407496977025,0.032648125755743655,0.03385731559854897,0.006045949214026602,0.16203143893591293,0.0036275695284159614,0.0012091898428053204,0.014510278113663845,0.07859733978234583,0,0.06408706166868199,0.0036275695284159614,0,0.04353083434099154,0.007255139056831923,0.11608222490931076,0,0.06529625151148731,0.02539298669891173,0.05199516324062878,0,0.0012091898428053204,0.02418379685610641,0.013301088270858524,0.12212817412333736,0,0,0,0,0,0.007255139056831923,0.036275695284159616,0,0,0.4244256348246675,0.0024183796856106408,0.015719467956469165,0,0.0012091898428053204,0.03990326481257558,0.0024183796856106408,0.0012091898428053204,0.014510278113663845,0.012091898428053204,0.0036275695284159614,0.02176541717049577,0.012091898428053204,0.014510278113663845,0.010882708585247884,0.010882708585247884,0,0.0024183796856106408,0.015719467956469165,0.18863361547763,0.0012091898428053204,0,0.019347037484885126,0.0471584038694075,0.10157194679564692,0.026602176541717048,0.02176541717049577,0.09310761789600967,0.13784764207980654,0.06650544135429262,0.015719467956469165,0,0.03385731559854897,0.10761789600967352,0,0.006045949214026602,0.006045949214026602,0.0024183796856106408,0.0036275695284159614,0,0,0.013301088270858524,0.07134220072551391,0.056831922611850064,0,0.02176541717049577,0.010882708585247884,0.03869407496977025,0.10399032648125756,0.10882708585247884,0,0.09068923821039904,0.0012091898428053204,48.375,0,62.375,6,9,1,9,20.05,2,62.175,19,10,28,0,48.375,0,101.375,10,142.6,251.97500000000002,101.375,,0.6432177231907706,0,0.6992100354613375,0.1827439976315568,0.2511664187323588,0.03592881186369607,0.2511664187323588,0.42766202686011495,0.06936540706703205,0.6985341623100378,0.4145501361280001,0.2714970279031851,0.5106431181261041,0,0.46154325544472224,0,0.10188698208497701,0.010050503781502048,0.1433201839242192,0.2532475690343979,-0.6848158400503556,0.7467524309656022,84
434,"30 Views November 18, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News With continued weakness in the precious metals markets, did this major divergence just trigger a bottom in gold and silver? The gold and silver markets are now showing a huge divergence which may prove to be a key in terms of seeing the bottom of this correction in the metals. Below we see that the price of gold (GLD used as a proxy) is hitting new lows (see chart below). At the same time, the price of silver is also hitting new lows (see chart below). Unlocking The Key: Here Is The Major Divergence Meanwhile, the HUI (Gold Mining Index) is diverging by trading above recent lows (see chart below). And the XAU (Gold Mining Index) is also diverging by trading above its recent lows (see chart below). KWN also spoke with one of the top mining CEO’s today and he said, “The selling in the mining stocks is looking very tired right now and they are just looking for an excuse to rally.”… IMPORTANT… To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored The divergence in the HUI and XAU mining indexes vs gold and silver is a major clue that a bottom may be forming. If the miners can hold above the recent lows that will give the signal that the correction has now officially come to an end and the uptrend in gold, silver, and the mining shares will resume. I t will be very interesting to see if this divergence did in fact mark a bottom in gold and silver in the days ahead.

435,"BLACKPOOL, England  —   “Ramones forever!” C. J. Ramone yelled to a tightly packed crowd at the Rebellion Festival here earlier this month, and a little roar rippled through a sea of   mohawks,   spikes  —   and more than a few balding heads. It was 40 years ago this summer that the Ramones flew to London and played a July 4 concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, an event that many cite as the moment that punk rock first took flight in Britain. A month earlier, a   London group called the Sex Pistols had played a gig at Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. It has been said that there were only a few dozen people in attendance, but every one went out and started a band. “I’ve said this quote before, but I’ll say it again,” Steve Diggle of the Buzzcocks said in a recent interview over a pint of Guinness in London. “If Jesus was born in Bethlehem, British punk was born in Manchester at that gig. ” The anniversary of that summer is being celebrated in Punk London, a citywide, yearlong series of exhibitions, talks and concerts supported by the mayor’s office and the National Lottery. Proving, perhaps, that punk’s rebellious spirit hasn’t yet receded into rock’s history books, this institutional endorsement of an   movement has drawn skepticism, a little bit of ridicule and even some mild acts of resistance. “We heard our song on BBC News,” as part of the anniversary celebrations, Noel Martin, 61, of the band Menace, which formed in the   said outside the Blackpool festival grounds. The song, “G. L. C. ,” which stood for Greater London Council, took aim at the city government, whose conservative members had called for a ban on punk concerts. “BBC banned that song 40 years ago, how come they’re playing it now?” In March, Joe Corré, the son of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and the Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren, vowed to burn 5 million pounds, or about $6. 46 million, worth of punk memorabilia to protest what he saw as the   of the movement. (The event, which is planned for this fall, was promptly added by a City Hall staff member to the Punk London website). In July, the singer Viv Albertine of the band the Slits visited the British Library for a talk connected to Punk London. While there, she stopped by the institution’s punk history exhibition to scrawl over the names of prominent female punk artists in permanent marker onto to the show’s signage. “What about the women! !” she wrote on a sign, crossing out the names of male punk groups and replacing them with   acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees and   Spex. The concerts of the summer of ’76 proved a crucible: In the months that followed, punk broke into public consciousness across Britain. The Clash, the Buzzcocks and the Damned gained nationwide attention. And the Sex Pistols became tabloid sensations, both for their wild behavior and their   lyrics, particularly for “God Save the Queen,” an   screed that suggested the queen was the head of a “fascist regime. ” The reaction from the news media was swift: Sex Pistols tracks, including “Queen” and “Anarchy in the U. K.,” were banned from the BBC, and, after reports that band members had spit on and yelled at staff at Heathrow Airport, the Pistols were dropped from their record label, EMI. The Sex Pistols dissolved in spectacular fashion months later, but the Ramones soldiered on for another 20 years (C. J. Ramone joined the band in the late ’80s). Fans and musicians at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, a resort town on the Irish Sea, noted the incongruity of the establishment’s embracing of punk rock, but they said the British punk scene was vibrant and even growing. “We go to gigs every week here, Manchester, Birmingham,” Graham Norris, 51, a fan of punk, said over a hot dog on the first day of the festival. “There’s lots of good bands coming through, a lot of them,” said Mr. Norris, who carried a cane and had a single synthetic green dreadlock threaded onto his last wisp of natural hair. “Maybe their dads were punks, maybe their mothers were punks and they’ve picked up on it. ” This festival’s lineup reflected that intergenerational spirit: Early bands like Agnostic Front and the Buzzcocks split the bill with newer acts like Youth Man and Angry Itch. Outside the main venue, a group of young punk fans gathered on a stoop, smoking and swigging from liquor bottles. One young musician, Connor MacPherson, 18, whose band the Antiseptics played at Punk Weekender, a   concert series held at the Roundhouse in July to commemorate the anniversary of the Ramones concert, said that the punk spirit was particularly relevant now that conservatives control Britain’s government. Describing himself as a “socialist with anarchist tendencies,” Mr. MacPherson got a rousing response from the others when he lobbed a shot at David Cameron, the former prime minister. “We have got a government that doesn’t care about the youth, that doesn’t care about the   people,” he said. “We need punk more than ever  —   we need punk more than they needed it in 1977. ” Nella Bellinzoni, 62, was selling bags and   sweaters in the halls of the festival. With blue hair sprayed vertical and reaching about a foot above her head (she said it took her around one and a half cans of hair spray and three hours to achieve the look) Ms. Bellinzoni, who described herself as an “old punk, from the beginning,” expressed a sunny vision of punk’s future. “It’s getting more and more stronger,” Ms. Bellinzoni, a native of Italy who lives near Blackpool, said. “All the kids, when their father or mother was punk, then they’re punk as well. ” One   duo was Simon Reynolds, 50, who took a train from London to Blackpool and his    son, Oscar. Mr. Reynolds, who started listening to punk in the early ’80s, said he thought that the movement had cleaned up its act somewhat since the early years and grown a “conscience. ” Oscar, with spiky green hair and a   advertising the punk band Gnarwolves, said he became interested in punk about eight years ago, through skateboarding and through his father. He said that he appreciated the sympathy for the working classes, and also that he liked that the music was different from what his friends listened to. Asked whether he ever felt strange dabbling in the same music scene as his father, he looked briefly incredulous. “No, no,” he said with a chuckle, before his face got serious and he added, “My dad’s rad. ”",0,1118,20.703703703703702,54,0.2853309481216458,0,0,0,0,96.94136310916275,15.963625521765058,83.9711091234347,43.717996422182466,0.7728085867620751,0.009838998211091235,0.044722719141323794,0.029516994633273702,0.03398926654740608,0.016100178890876567,0.2101967799642218,0.008050089445438283,0.0008944543828264759,0.020572450805008944,0.11449016100178891,0.0008944543828264759,0.03488372093023256,0.016100178890876567,0.008050089445438283,0.005366726296958855,0.008944543828264758,0.04740608228980322,0.0026833631484794273,0.08676207513416816,0.027728085867620753,0.05008944543828265,0,0,0.013416815742397137,0.0035778175313059034,0.059033989266547404,0.0026833631484794273,0.008050089445438283,0.005366726296958855,0.013416815742397137,0,0.0035778175313059034,0.08050089445438283,0.0017889087656529517,0.0017889087656529517,0.43917710196779963,0.0017889087656529517,0.03041144901610018,0,0.0026833631484794273,0.044722719141323794,0.0035778175313059034,0.0026833631484794273,0.012522361359570662,0.01520572450805009,0.038461538461538464,0.027728085867620753,0.005366726296958855,0.016100178890876567,0.004472271914132379,0.011627906976744186,0.0017889087656529517,0.0008944543828264759,0.0259391771019678,0.20930232558139536,0.0035778175313059034,0.0026833631484794273,0.04293381037567084,0.049194991055456175,0.06618962432915922,0.04114490161001789,0.02146690518783542,0.0259391771019678,0.14311270125223613,0.08586762075134168,0.024150268336314847,0.0008944543828264759,0.04114490161001789,0.1475849731663685,0.006261180679785331,0.011627906976744186,0.0017889087656529517,0.0008944543828264759,0.007155635062611807,0,0.004472271914132379,0.022361359570661897,0.11449016100178891,0.06708407871198568,0.0008944543828264759,0.009838998211091235,0.009838998211091235,0.06529516994633273,0.10822898032200358,0.10465116279069768,0.005366726296958855,0.017889087656529516,0.0008944543828264759,36.140625,10,75,1,3,12,3,28.975,29.73,25,6.5,51,23.25,0,36.140625,0,131.41062499999998,24,105.975,257.385625,131.41062499999998,,0.5237469753432406,0.23329952500316292,0.6953242004899345,0.02953044805404075,0.08365085000086826,0.26747889038858935,0.08365085000086826,0.4685603413306077,0.474970557754208,0.4320523873796685,0.1651282075904744,0.6081321328298432,0.41433987759417307,0,0.37833392500911667,0,0.10082252134704953,0.01841358347035629,0.08130747951129198,0.19747465375030512,0.5225761840679066,0.8025253462496948,72
436,"Lukas Mikelionis, Heat Street, October 24, 2016 {snip} According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. In a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn’t picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed “we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.” “But I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative–and that narrative is about, to be blunt, it’s about theft and genocide”, the professor said. {snip} “It’s not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age . . . Certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society. They’re frequently highly educated people. They’re almost completely white,” she said. CBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: “Should we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?” To which the academic replied: “Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.” {snip} Either way, somebody should break the news to Canada’s woke Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about this. It’s 2016, after all.

437,"Email Following the surprisingly strong electoral victory of Donald Trump to the White House in this year’s presidential election, a spokesperson for a group founded to revive the rejected 2007 DREAM Atct — which would have granted amnesty to minors illegally in the United States — pledged to resist mass deportation of illegal aliens. The spokesperson also called Border Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel ""agents of racism.” In a statement quoted by the Washington Times , Cristina Jimenez, co-founder of United We Dream (which describes itself as “the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation”) said: “Immigrants are declaring a state of urgency and resilience. Over the coming weeks, our families and community members will need to tap into the incredible strength that brought us to this country and which we use to survive.” In her statement, Jimenez not only expressed dismay at the election of Trump but also castigated the agents of the federal agencies charged with protecting our borders. “All people with love in our hearts are angered and disappointed tonight and pledge to resist mass deportation,” she said. “ICE and CBP have proven themselves to be agents of racism and agents of hate.” Both the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council — the two unions that represent Border Patrol and ICE agents, respectively, had announced endorsements of Trump during the presidential campaign. We reported in our article last April that the NBPC’s leaders — including Brandon Judd, the union’s president; Kenneth Palinkas, its past president; Shawn Moran; the union’s vice president; and Chris Cabrera, a spokesperson for the NBPC’s Rio Grande Valley council — have all been vocal in criticizing the Obama administration’s lack of enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws. The NBPC issued a press release on March 30 that stated part of the reason for its endorsement of Trump: Mr. Trump is correct when he says immigration wouldn’t be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadn’t made some bold and necessary statements. And when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of a man. When the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States. The union representing the nation’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff, the ICE Council, endorsed Trump last September. Their endorsement statement noted: Donald Trump reached out to us for a meeting, sat down with me to discuss his goals for enforcement, and pledged to support ICE officers, our nation’s laws and our members. In his immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security— including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory detainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. A notice on the United We Dream website stated that when the DREAM Act failed to get 60 votes in the Senate in 2007, a “group of DREAMers, organizers, and advocates came together to reflect on the DREAM Act campaign and talk about building a movement and organization that would not hinge on votes in Congress.” President Obama, frustrated that the DREAM Act (the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) had repeatedly failed to pass, had already decided to bypass Congress by creating the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to allow youth who had brought into the country illegally by their parents as children immigrants to work legally in the United States. Critics of DACA have pointed out that the program is a means to circumvent Congress and grant amnesty to those who reside here illegally. The DACA program was created in 2012 via policy memo by then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. In 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson further expanded the DACA program by removing its age cap and extending the work authorization to three years. Subsequently a group of states challenged this executive action in the case of State of Texas, et al v United States, et al. The DACA program was brought to a halt after U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas responded to the plaintiff states by issuing an order of temporary injunction to block the federal government from implementing the Obama administration’s policy memorandums that expanded DACA and implemented the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. The Obama administration appealed Hanen’s ruing in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. After the court issued a tied 8-8 decision on the appeal, Hanen’s injunction was allowed to stand. With the election of Donald Trump, it is expected that the new president will issue an executive order of his own to reverse those issued by Obama administration officials to create DACA. It is the anticipation of this move that has groups such as United We Dream worried.

438,". CDC Scientist Confirms Donald Trump is Right About Vaccines and Autism Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/cdc-scientist-confirms-donald-trump-is.html Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and interviews over the past few years, the presidential candidate has stated that he strongly believes that there is a link between ""monstrous"" vaccines and autism . He has suggested that delivering vaccines in smaller doses over time could reduce autism rates among U.S. children. Despite being cast to the lunatic fringe by the mainstream media for his remarks, CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson has confirmed Trump's suspicions — namely, that   autism is real .Congressman Bill Posey from Florida helped expose the corruption of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . He recently read a statement on the House floor written by CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson.In the statement, Dr. Thompson admitted to omitting data from a study which showed that autism rates were higher among African American boys who received the MMR vaccination before the age of three.(1) ""Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about their children's health deserve to have the best information available to them. ""They should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth. For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor,"" Posey stated.(2) He then proceeded to read the statement provided by Dr. Thompson. The statement pertained to a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics. The doctor revealed that he and his colleagues intentionally destroyed data in the study which showed that African American MMR-vaccinated boys under the age of three had   for autism. According to the whistleblower, the CDC held a meeting of scientists to discuss whether they should destroy the evidence. The authors decided to scrap their findings. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved computer files and hard copies of the omitted data for legal reasons.(3) ""Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to insure that the documents that Dr. Thompson are not ignored. Therefore I will provide them to members of Congress and the House Committees upon request. ""Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted,"" Posey concluded.(2) Because the report pertains to vaccines, the mainstream media continues to ignore these revelations. Meanwhile, they continue to parade Donald Trump as a kook for suggesting that there is a link   The double standard boggles the mind and sickens the stomach.Trump hasn't backed down from the vaccine debate despite the mainstream media's backlash against his remarks. In 2015, he appeared on the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show stating: ""I've known people that had totally magnificent children, functioning a hundred percent, everything beautiful, smart as a whip, and they go for this shot and get this shot of this massive dose, of everything at one time, and they end up with horrible autism.""(4) In addition, Trump stated on a Fox News television program in 2012: ""I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.""(5) Trump made similar remarks in a series of tweets in 2014, after a CDC report revealed that autism rates in U.S. children had increased by 30 percent in the last two years.(6)The CDC report that coincided with Trump's tweets did not actually state what caused the spike in autism rates. Given Dr. Thompson's recent testimony, however, it's easy to think of at least one possibility. By S.

440,"The monster they created is running amok. Credit: VDare. These two things happened the day after Donald Trump won the election: First, a Washington Post reporter named Peter Holley called the American Renaissance office to ask–in dead seriousness–whether anyone from the Trump team had called us for policy advice. Second, Gloria Gonzalez-Garcia, a Mexican-American explained to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram what a Trump victory meant: “We were getting the message, ‘If you are not white, you don’t belong here.’ ” So what’s the connection? Let’s start with the Post ’s Mr. Holley . [ ] He is a professional newsman who attended Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism. He calls himself an “experienced reporter with a talent for uncovering compelling stories that other people overlook.” It’s his job to find out and report what is going on–and he seriously thought the victorious Trump team would check in with me for instructions. He’s not alone. The same day, a journalist from the biggest newspaper in Latin America– Folha de S. Paulo – wanted to know if I had telephoned my friend Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory. I told her I have never met him and don’t have his number. What we have here is a stupefying delusion: that Donald Trump is a secret “white supremacist,” who dances to the tune of the Alt-Right. This delusion has two sources: ignorance and maliciousness . People like Peter Holley are so deeply marinated in liberal ignorance that they can’t tell the difference between American nationalism and racial nationalism–between the desire to put American interests first and white racial consciousness. As I have explained elsewhere , the maliciousness involved looking for racial dissidents who supported Donald Trump and then arguing that since “racists” backed him, Trump must be a “racist,” too. When Mr. Trump didn’t denounce David Duke and “white supremacy” fiercely enough to suit them, they claimed this was proof he is a secret sympathizer. They were wrong. He just doesn’t like being pushed around by journalists who hates him. The pro-Hillary media therefore created a Frankenstein monster–an imaginary Donald Trump who secretly wants to make America white again. They called him a bigot, a xenophobe, a fascist, a threat to democracy and, of course, the new Hitler. They hoped this would frighten enough voters into the Hillary camp to stop Mr. Trump, but it didn’t work. And now they are stuck with a Frankenstein president elect who, they are convinced, comes running to me for policy tips. Yesterday, Senator Harry Reid issued an idiotic press release that included these lines: White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear–especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. It is because she has heard so many Frankenstein stories that poor Gloria in Fort Worth–a US citizen–thinks the real Trump message is that non-whites don’t belong in America. And she’s hardly alone. Jason Perez (right) a university student in Hawaii, writes that “the next four years will be a living nightmare for all Hispanic Americans.” Mercedes Rosales , a high school senior in Homestead, Florida, says Mr. Trump “just wants to get rid of Mexicans, or Latinos.” Maria Perez , also of Homestead, says, “Because of the example of Donald Trump . . . now they can look at you and see you are an immigrant and kill you.” Mary Rabago , a Hispanic journalist living in Arizona, explains the election results: “Hate won.” The Muslim reaction is just as nutty. Asaad Alabdulaziz, an Iraqi who recently became a US citizen , asks, “Do I have to go back?” Sahar Aziz , a professor at the Texas A&M University, says that “the general mood I am seeing among Muslims is concern that a Trump presidency will be open season on them.” No one–not once in the campaign–ever talked about deporting law-abiding legal residents. So where did people get these deranged ideas? Obviously, from media caricatures. Hispanics are no doubt getting lurid stuff from the Spanish-language press as well. Telesur , a consortium based in Venezuela, reports that under a Trump presidency, “the rights of black and brown people, immigrants and women will suffer serious setbacks.” People like Peter Holley–who created the caricature and believe in it–are on such hair-trigger alert for “racism” that they can’t conceive of a non-racial American nationalism that expresses itself in the ideas that helped Donald Trump win: Illegal immigrants should stay out. Illegals who are here should go home. There should be no sanctuary cities. Birth-right citizenship is crazy. Muslims are potentially troublesome. Legal immigration should be cut. There is nothing inherently racial about any of these ideas, and they appeal to millions of Americans who don’t think in racial terms. But current dogma demands that we thrill to the idea that every brown-skinned newcomer–whether he has a job or even speaks English–is a precious addition to our “greatest strength,” which is diversity. Anyone who supports policies that have the effect of slowing the march of diversity is a “racist,” and might as well be a dedicated AmRen reader or even a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That’s why Peter Holley thinks Donald Trump wants my advice. The notion that Mr. Trump will hurt blacks is especially wrong, but it follows the usual sloppy liberal thinking: If you want to send home illegals it can only be because you hate Hispanics, which means you hate blacks, women, homosexuals, and Jews. Donald Trump wanted Confederate flags taken down in the South, is “fine” with affirmative action , and he blasted Justice Antonin Scalia’s critique of race preferences in universities. And only the most fevered imagination could have prompted the Salon headline: “ I Am a Gay Jew in Trump’s America. And I Am Afraid for My Life .” Mr. Trump’s close professional and family connections to Jews are well known . It is the widely circulated fantasies about Donald-Trump-the-racist that explain why Mexican-Americans and Muslims who are US citizens are reportedly crying themselves to sleep at night, and why there are violent anti-Trump demonstrations all over the country. Just as reckless anti-police reporting paved the way for the murders of policemen , frothing press coverage of Donald Trump has sent thousands of ignoramuses into the streets to smash store windows and attack cops. The papers are now full of breathless reports of Trump supporters calling blacks “ni**er” and tearing hijabs off Muslim women. Some of these attacks were faked , but some are no doubt real. What do they reflect? What Donald Trump wants or what the Frankenstein wants? If loutish whites are telling Hispanics “we’ll deport you,” who gave them the idea that a modern-day Hitler is about to move into the White House? The Trump-is-a-racist idea is so firmly planted in the minds of Hillary supporters that nothing can dislodge it. But they don’t even understand what they, themselves, mean by it. Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones called me after the election to talk about the Alt-Right. I explained to him how the media have painted a dishonest picture of Donald Trump, and he conceded that he was beginning to realize that using his favorite word–“racist”–to describe the president elect and people like me might be a mistake. I congratulated him on this intellectual breakthrough, and then asked what Donald Trump has ever said or done that was “racist,” whatever that word means. “Oh, there are so many, I don’t know where to begin.” “Then just tell me one.” There was a brief silence. “He retweeted an image of himself as Pepe the frog.” “What? Is that the best you can do? You’re really straining.” “Yes, I guess I’m straining.” Mr. Harkinson later brought up Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Judge Gonazlo Curiel’s Mexican ancestry meant he could not try the Trump University case fairly. I pointed out that Judge Curiel is a member of La Raza [the race] Lawyers, which gave Mr. Trump grounds to doubt his impartiality. “Besides,” I said, “if a white police officer is in an altercation with a black criminal and ends up shooting him, you’d be the first to say the officer was biased on account of his race.” “Not the first.” “Then the second.” We live in a world of malicious fantasy. If members of that priestly class known as journalists–everyone knows they are sternly objective–call someone a “racist” that’s what he is. And once you’re a “racist,” you might as well be a sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semite, homophobe, and who knows what else. This is what we get when reporters slant the news and then believe what they read in the papers. And the media can’t understand why no one trusts them anymore.

442,"Donald J. Trump’s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media, the banks and the government.   Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word: globalism. It is a word that conjures many images, none of them good: shuttered factories, unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that, believers say, controls the economy and the media. Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the  . They say it carries multiple meanings  —   from benign to sinister  —   and often serves as a “dog whistle” for racist,   and antigovernment conspiracy theorists. “Globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States,” said Ryan Lenz, the editor of Hatewatch, a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “It is the enemy, ultimately. ” Globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization, the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions, environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But for the far right, the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism, xenophobia and   according to Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League. Lauren Southern, a host on the   Canadian media site Rebel Media, explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September. She said the word meant rule by autocrats  —   such as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and the United Nations  —   who value “the false flag of diversity” and “unchecked immigration from the third world. ” “Globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition, disdain national culture, laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third world,” she added. “They want open borders, cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions, and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it. ” Breitbart News, the   website run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s newly appointed chief White House strategist, frequently attacked globalism and   “globalist elites” during Mr. Bannon’s tenure there. But no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than Alex Jones, a   radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his Infowars media empire. He has been called “the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among his claims: the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Conn. was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job. Mr. Jones posted his own definition of globalism to YouTube in 2014. In his trademark shout, he described it as a “global digital panopticon control system” engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites. He called it “the total form of slavery. ” The host, who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump, hailed the Republican as a “George  ” historical figure. Mr. Trump, who appeared on his show last year, has in turn heaped praise upon Mr. Jones. “Your reputation is amazing,” Mr. Trump said. “I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we’ll be speaking a lot. ” So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism? His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, provided a definition in an email before the election last week:   groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War, when it replaced communism as an idea that was an   danger to the nation, Mr. Pitcavage said. They have also referred to it as the New World Order, and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere. The shape of that conspiracy had distinctly   overtones, in part because many of communism’s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism, Mr. Pitcavage said. Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the businessman and philanthropist George Soros. Those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former President George Bush celebrated the end of the Cold War in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a “new world order. ” His use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot. “It was very easy for them, especially because he was the one who said it, to take that ball and run with it,” Mr. Pitcavage said. “From that point on, the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory. ” The term’s multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool, and Mr. Trump’s and his allies’ frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience. “  is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right” from the mainstream to the extreme, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Professor Levin called globalism “the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right” but said it had also “become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in. ” Globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of Mr. Trump’s campaign, for example, when he told  a rally in Florida in October that his opponent for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, had sat at the heart of a   conspiracy with international bankers “to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty. ” The   League criticized the speech for “evoking classic   themes. ” Conspiratorial talk has continued after the election. Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday, when he complained on Twitter that   protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters. Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News, later accused Mr. Soros of “inciting riots. ” Many on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump’s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy. Last Friday, Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon. Ms. Hicks, the Trump campaign’s spokeswoman, did not reply to an email seeking comment late Sunday night. Mr. Jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important: the coming destruction of “the globalists that hijacked the country,” primarily the news media and international business people. Soon they would be destroyed once and for all, he suggested. “This is America battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains,” he said. “There’s not gonna be any détente. We know you’re scum, and we’re just here to let you know you’re scum. ”",0,1148,19.79310344827586,58,0.3240418118466899,0,0,0,0,94.73187323709972,17.23508740581911,84.59913721586196,21.745234679237548,0.7926829268292683,0.010452961672473868,0.042682926829268296,0.032229965156794424,0.037456445993031356,0.017421602787456445,0.19076655052264807,0.013937282229965157,0.002613240418118467,0.013066202090592335,0.10714285714285714,0.0008710801393728223,0.05139372822299652,0.003484320557491289,0.002613240418118467,0.010452961672473868,0.0078397212543554,0.06881533101045297,0.004355400696864111,0.05662020905923345,0.020905923344947737,0.054878048780487805,0,0.002613240418118467,0.010452961672473868,0.003484320557491289,0.09407665505226481,0,0,0.003484320557491289,0.003484320557491289,0,0.010452961672473868,0.050522648083623695,0.0008710801393728223,0.0008710801393728223,0.445993031358885,0,0.018292682926829267,0.0008710801393728223,0.002613240418118467,0.037456445993031356,0.003484320557491289,0.0008710801393728223,0.02264808362369338,0.012195121951219513,0.008710801393728223,0.039198606271777,0.013937282229965157,0.006097560975609756,0.004355400696864111,0.01916376306620209,0.003484320557491289,0,0.008710801393728223,0.18902439024390244,0.003484320557491289,0,0.0313588850174216,0.06707317073170732,0.054878048780487805,0.04529616724738676,0.016550522648083623,0.06358885017421603,0.13588850174216027,0.08275261324041812,0.01916376306620209,0.0008710801393728223,0.04529616724738676,0.14634146341463414,0.003484320557491289,0.009581881533101045,0.0017421602787456446,0.0008710801393728223,0.0078397212543554,0,0,0.025261324041811847,0.11062717770034843,0.09059233449477352,0,0.016550522648083623,0.008710801393728223,0.04790940766550523,0.10888501742160278,0.10801393728222997,0.002613240418118467,0.03484320557491289,0.006097560975609756,76.50625,7,173.625,3,5.625,10,20,57,10,116.7,3,26.875,23,0,76.50625,0,142.00625,30,278.52500000000003,441.53124999999994,142.00625,,0.69195707747057,0.17048731694236688,0.8360065772888902,0.0809524919162106,0.14174559556140703,0.22696955407408304,0.36996770346981056,0.6259693414477694,0.22696955407408304,0.7740843062417901,0.0809524919162106,0.44105261819692376,0.40309314236547455,0,0.5273473105267378,0,0.09482690261054652,0.020032970931324473,0.18598944095490497,0.29483942321737855,-0.8500442193667794,0.7051605767826215,92
443,"ATLANTA  —   With local television programming interrupted and a camera trained on the defendant’s emotionless face, an   father was convicted of murder on Monday for causing the death of his young son by deliberately leaving him in a hot car more than two years ago. A jury in southeast Georgia, where the case was tried because of intense pretrial publicity here, returned guilty verdicts against the man, Justin Ross Harris, 35, on eight counts, including malice murder and cruelty to children. Mr. Harris, who sometimes glanced downward as the verdict was read in Brunswick, could be sentenced to life in prison for the death of his    son, Cooper. The verdict, announced on the jury’s fourth day of deliberations, ended the suspense of a trial that began on Oct. 3, and it capped nearly 29 months of sordid allegations and scrambled loyalties. The cause of Cooper’s death was undisputed  —   Mr. Harris left him in a Hyundai Tucson while he worked as a software engineer at Home Depot on June 18, 2014  —   but it fell to jurors to decide whether he had been malicious or merely  . The manner of Cooper’s death is a heartbreakingly familiar one: At least 39 children in the United States have died of “vehicular heatstroke” this year, according to statistics compiled by a San Jose State University researcher. But the case against Mr. Harris was striking because of the severity of the charges and the state’s argument that he was eager to end his responsibilities to his family. “This killer’s heart abandoned this child long before he died,” Charles P. Boring, an assistant district attorney, said during his closing argument. “This defendant’s heart abandoned this child when he left him to die a terrible death in that car. ” In a statement after the verdict, the district attorney’s office noted a message that Mr. Harris sent minutes before he left his vehicle, Cooper still in his car seat: “I love my son and all, but we both need escapes. ” But near the end of a trial in which Mr. Harris was vilified as a   man with a compromised marriage, one of his lawyers, H. Maddox Kilgore, argued that moral failings did not make a motive for murder. “There is no evidence of any kind of hatred or bad feelings or anger,” Mr. Kilgore said. “Whatever term you want to come up with, any term you come up with, there’s no evidence that Ross expressed that toward his son. ” In the end, Mr. Harris was convicted on all eight counts for which he was indicted. Three of the charges were not connected to Cooper’s death and instead focused on Mr. Harris’s electronic communications with at least one underage girl. He will be sentenced next month. Although Mr. Harris’s former wife, Leanna Taylor, filed for divorce after Cooper’s death, she testified in her husband’s defense. Ms. Taylor’s lawyer, Lawrence J. Zimmerman, said she was “deeply disappointed” by the verdict.",0,502,23.904761904761905,21,0.33067729083665337,0,0,0,0,95.47765810075063,15.619996205653571,83.05438247011952,1,0.7669322709163346,0.00796812749003984,0.0398406374501992,0.01593625498007968,0.05179282868525897,0.0199203187250996,0.19721115537848605,0.021912350597609563,0.00199203187250996,0.029880478087649404,0.07768924302788845,0,0.043824701195219126,0.01195219123505976,0.00597609561752988,0.01195219123505976,0.00398406374501992,0.07171314741035857,0.00398406374501992,0.06573705179282868,0.02390438247011952,0.045816733067729085,0,0.027888446215139442,0.029880478087649404,0.00597609561752988,0.0796812749003984,0,0.0199203187250996,0.00398406374501992,0.01195219123505976,0,0.00199203187250996,0.05976095617529881,0,0,0.42828685258964144,0.00199203187250996,0.00597609561752988,0.00398406374501992,0.00398406374501992,0.035856573705179286,0,0.00199203187250996,0.01195219123505976,0.013944223107569721,0.00597609561752988,0.07370517928286853,0,0.0199203187250996,0.00796812749003984,0.045816733067729085,0,0,0.027888446215139442,0.1852589641434263,0.00597609561752988,0,0.01195219123505976,0.06374501992031872,0.06374501992031872,0.055776892430278883,0.00597609561752988,0.04183266932270916,0.1553784860557769,0.09163346613545817,0.01593625498007968,0,0.027888446215139442,0.1553784860557769,0.00199203187250996,0.00199203187250996,0.01195219123505976,0.0099601593625498,0.00199203187250996,0,0,0.045816733067729085,0.13147410358565736,0.07768924302788845,0,0.01593625498007968,0,0.05776892430278884,0.08764940239043825,0.09362549800796813,0.00199203187250996,0.025896414342629483,0.00398406374501992,0,0,124.375,15.45,4,4,4,28.2,5,82,4,0,15,0,0,0,28,17,185.20000000000002,223.20000000000002,28,,0,0,0.8585348455382349,0.42983647688551463,0.16330595576157622,0.16330595576157622,0.16330595576157622,0.5791279629034182,0.19612533584707845,0.8000476006317617,0.16330595576157622,0,0.42260781014763055,0,0.8279542434629685,0,0.041407867494824016,0.025140490979000295,0.2738834664300503,0.3300798580301686,-0.9155963623751938,0.6699201419698314,49
444,"Richard N. Bolles, a former Harvard physics major, Episcopal minister and career counselor whose own twisting vocational path led to his writing “What Color Is Your Parachute?”  —   the most popular  ’s manual of the 1970s and beyond  —   died on Friday in San Ramon, Calif. He was 90. His son Gary said he died in San Ramon Regional Medical Center. Mr. Bolles lived nearby in Danville, Calif. Mr. Bolles (pronounced bowls) originally   his manual in 1970 as a photocopied   booklet for unemployed Protestant ministers. In 1972, he recast it to appeal to a wider audience and found an independent publisher in Berkeley, Calif. willing to print small batches so that it could be frequently updated. Since then, “Parachute” has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print. In 1995, the Library of Congress placed Mr. Bolles’s book squarely within the canon of classic American   literature by including it, along with Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and the “The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,” in “25 Books That Have Shaped Readers’ Lives,” a list compiled as part of a nationwide   program. The book’s unconventional yet pragmatic advice, whimsical narrative style and vintage graphics  —   reminiscent of “The Whole Earth Catalog,” another   survivors’ manual of the time  —   earned it respectful reviews for its reliable research and an early    following among career counselors and personnel directors. It also found a fan base among   attracted to Mr. Bolles’s homespun style  —   a fusion of boot camp rigor (  should spend at least 40 hours a week hunting) practical advice (“If you’re being interviewed over lunch, never  —   never  —   order a drink . .. Don’t . .. do . .. it! . .. Even if they do it”) and muted spirituality.   was an art form, more like dating than like selling a used car, he told readers. “You may never understand why things sometimes work, and sometimes don’t,” he wrote. With that in mind, Mr. Bolles said, “What Color Is Your Parachute? ,” subtitled “A Practical Manual for   and Career Changers,” was framed less as a guide to the job market than as a guide to help readers understand themselves  —   to help them figure out what they really liked doing so that they could find the job that would let them do it. “You need firm ground to stand on,” Mr. Bolles told an interviewer in 2000. “From there you can deal with the change. ” Mr. Bolles, an ordained Episcopal minister until 2004, when he left the ministry, said the title of his book came from an   discussion he had in the 1960s with parishioners who were unhappy in their jobs. They would say they were thinking of bailing out. “And I always thought of an airplane when I heard that phrase,” he said. “So I would respond, ‘What color is your parachute?’ ” “Parachute” climbed   rankings slowly but steadily throughout the decade. In 1979, it reached the New York Times   list, where it remained for more than a decade, returning intermittently for years afterward. Mr. Bolles was well qualified to write a handbook on changing direction he had changed his own several times, from planning a career in the chemical industry to becoming a minister and then, at 41, experiencing being fired and enduring the anxiety of unemployment at a time when he and his wife then, the former Janet Price, had four small children. It had never entered his mind, though, that he would write a blockbuster. “I was just trying to help people be better prepared than I was when I was fired and started looking for a job,” he said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. Yet whether he knew it or not, Mr. Bolles had anticipated a sea change in the relationship between workers and employers in the United States, said Micki McGee, an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University and the author of “  Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life,” a 2005 examination of   literature that includes an analysis of Mr. Bolles’s book. She said “Parachute” had come along at the beginning of a historic shift, when corporate strategies like outsourcing, subcontracting, downsizing and mergers were starting to erode traditional notions of job security. The idea that you could stay in one job for a lifetime began coming undone in the early 1970s, and “Parachute’s” perennial sales reflected, at least in part, this new reality. Mr. Bolles said he had come to acknowledge that connection over time, but, he added wryly, the success of “Parachute” had also reflected the fact that it was a pretty good book. Richard Nelson Bolles was born on March 19, 1927, in Milwaukee, the first of three children of Donald Clinton Bolles, an editor for The Associated Press, and the former Frances Fifield, a homemaker. His brother, Donald Jr. who followed his father into journalism, was killed in 1976 in Phoenix when a bomb detonated under his car. Don Bolles was then working as an investigative reporter for The Arizona Republic, and the killing was widely believed to be linked to a series of exposés he had been writing about corporate and organized crime in the state. The assassination resulted in the prosecution of one person but remained largely unsolved. After serving in the Navy at the tail end of World War II, Richard Bolles studied chemical engineering for two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then transferred to Harvard, where he earned his bachelor’s degree cum laude with a major in physics. While still an undergraduate, he was moved by a sermon he heard one Sunday at church about a critical shortage of ministers. After graduation, instead of accepting a lucrative job offer in the chemical industry, he decided to become an Episcopal minister. He attended General Theological Seminary in New York, where he received a master’s degree in New Testament studies and was ordained in 1953. He served as a rector at several churches in northern New Jersey, including St. John’s in Passaic, where he often counseled teenagers on sex and drug use. After participating in the 1963 March on Washington led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. he reached out to an   church in Passaic and, with its pastor, the Rev. Avery Johnson, led the integration of their churches, despite the opposition of some parishioners. Mr. Bolles had been a clergyman for 18 years when a combination of budget problems and philosophical differences with superiors led to the elimination of his job and his dismissal in 1968 as a pastor at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, the flagship church of the Episcopal Diocese of California. After six months of anxious searching, he landed a job in 1969 with United Ministries in Higher Education, an interdenominational church organization that had long been involved in recruiting and supporting college chaplains across the country. But college chaplains were increasingly being laid off, leaving Mr. Bolles a new mission: to help chaplains at campuses in seven Western states find new careers. That effort led him into research that inspired him to write the   manual that evolved into “What Color Is Your Parachute?” Among his other books was “The Three Boxes of Life and How to Get Out of Them,” on balancing work and personal life. Besides his son Gary, he is survived by his wife, Marci Mendoza Bolles two other children from his first marriage, Stephen and Sharon Bolles and 10 grandchildren. A third son, Mark, died in 2012. In the 2014 interview, Mr. Bolles said he hoped his franchise would continue after he was gone. His son Gary, he said, had asked him about updating future editions of “Parachute” and finding other   experts who might provide new advice. “I told him to make sure to find people who were funny, have a lightheartedness about them,” Mr. Bolles said. “When you are out of work and on the ropes, that is so important. ”",0,1319,22.35593220338983,59,0.32297194844579225,0,0,0,0,92.29618194382367,18.144492483385584,84.5219321997184,37.858057450930836,0.8157695223654283,0.014404852160727824,0.04094010614101592,0.03335860500379075,0.02350265352539803,0.014404852160727824,0.1956027293404094,0.003032600454890068,0.001516300227445034,0.012130401819560273,0.08339651250947688,0,0.0576194086429113,0.009097801364670205,0,0.014404852160727824,0.006065200909780136,0.07354056103108415,0.001516300227445034,0.06823351023502654,0.02577710386656558,0.05686125852918878,0,0.006065200909780136,0.016679302501895376,0.012130401819560273,0.06899166034874905,0.000758150113722517,0.0075815011372251705,0.000758150113722517,0.002274450341167551,0,0.009097801364670205,0.07202426080363912,0.000758150113722517,0.000758150113722517,0.467778620166793,0.006065200909780136,0.01061410159211524,0,0.00530705079605762,0.03639120545868082,0.000758150113722517,0.001516300227445034,0.018953752843062926,0.019711902956785442,0.009097801364670205,0.0576194086429113,0.008339651250947688,0.021986353297952996,0.006065200909780136,0.0075815011372251705,0,0.000758150113722517,0.0310841546626232,0.2137983320697498,0.006065200909780136,0.002274450341167551,0.017437452615617893,0.06292645943896892,0.10614101592115238,0.06292645943896892,0.014404852160727824,0.0401819560272934,0.1599696739954511,0.09931766489764973,0.012130401819560273,0.003032600454890068,0.03866565579984837,0.16755117513267628,0.02122820318423048,0.006823351023502654,0.001516300227445034,0.000758150113722517,0.00530705079605762,0,0.001516300227445034,0.04094010614101592,0.12206216830932524,0.08339651250947688,0,0.009855951478392721,0.009097801364670205,0.06368460955269144,0.11599696739954511,0.11296436694465505,0,0.0712661106899166,0.0075815011372251705,23.975,7,83,0,13,0,10.73,11,17.73,68,19.475,21.73,23.405,0,23.975,0,101.38,10.73,125,226.11,101.38,,0.41105077246549077,0.1692819597899623,0.707279097881462,0,0.2745446735610874,0,0.23801533941731998,0.2425518496893189,0.340430414152932,0.6643795850536577,0.36181313233223755,0.3874743741081799,0.4052383838777229,0,0.4577661184791291,0,0.06817249564591724,0.0072153371304073,0.08405565156578867,0.15204658700432383,-0.4930085912848015,0.8479534129956762,58
445,"Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon delivered a powerhouse presentation along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus at CPAC on Thursday, in which one of Bannon’s main messages was that the media’s daily war against the Trump administration will continue unabated. [As Bannon explained to the CPAC audience:  [President Trump] is going to continue to press his agenda as economic conditions get better, as jobs get better, [and] they are going to continue to fight. If you think they are going to give you your country back without a fight, you are mistaken. Every day, it is going to be a fight. Bannon also clearly and bluntly stated the reason that the media onslaught will continue, saying, “The corporatist, globalist media is adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has. ” Bannon’s message is solidly based in fact, and a deeper understanding of what he means by the “corporatist, globalist media” goes a long way toward explaining why the establishment media will be battling Trump tooth and nail. For one thing, the “corporatist, globalist media” is really a very small number of companies  —   something that Steve Bannon understands well given his background in both media and on Wall Street. As Business Insider reported five years ago, six corporations control 90% of the media in America, which puts a huge amount of power in the hands of a very few people. That number is down from 50 companies back in 1983. Who runs things? A ranking of the world’s largest media companies of 2015 says that Comcast Corporation is the largest media conglomerate in the U. S. with The Walt Disney Company,   Century Fox, and Time Warner in the second, third, and fourth slots. The members of the media, the “opposition party at the back of the room,” are really just cogs in this machine  —   the   foot soldiers who’ve been put through a rigorous program of indoctrination in journalism school. These members of the progressive left not only face corporate pressure to conform to certain narratives, but members of the modern American media have also been taught that they possess a moral superiority and are on a mission to help make the world a better place. This combination of corporate overlords and leftist propaganda is what allows the media to avoid the inherent contradictions in the system that they defend. It’s why the media can spread the message of “open societies” and a world based on “love, not hate” that is being directed by billionaire funders like George Soros and his multimillionaire allies like the Clintons. Now add in the internationalist factor at an ownership level, even with fundamentalist Muslim countries like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As Forbes reported, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and the company Kingdom Holding have stakes in media ventures like Twitter and even the parent of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. The Saudi Prince owns about 1% of the company, plus 6. 6% shareholding in 21st Century Fox Inc. worth about $1. 7 billion. Kingdom Holdings also has substantial shareholding in Time Warner, the parent of CNN. This is just one small example of the complex world of globalist media that the Trump administration is facing and part of the reason that more and more people are turning to new media upstarts like Breitbart News to get real information. As former executive chairman of Breitbart, it’s a world that Steve Bannon sees clearly.",0,585,21.666666666666668,27,0.3213675213675214,0,0,0,0,96.01414482952944,19.7659069325736,74.21202095395643,12.24856096284668,0.7777777777777778,0.008547008547008548,0.039316239316239315,0.039316239316239315,0.035897435897435895,0.022222222222222223,0.15042735042735042,0.011965811965811967,0.003418803418803419,0.015384615384615385,0.09914529914529914,0.0017094017094017094,0.05641025641025641,0.008547008547008548,0.006837606837606838,0.017094017094017096,0.010256410256410256,0.05811965811965812,0.0017094017094017094,0.04786324786324787,0.035897435897435895,0.046153846153846156,0,0.0017094017094017094,0.013675213675213675,0.003418803418803419,0.0905982905982906,0,0.003418803418803419,0.003418803418803419,0,0,0.011965811965811967,0.015384615384615385,0,0,0.441025641025641,0,0.003418803418803419,0.003418803418803419,0,0.046153846153846156,0.006837606837606838,0,0.017094017094017096,0.013675213675213675,0.003418803418803419,0.010256410256410256,0.006837606837606838,0.015384615384615385,0.005128205128205128,0.022222222222222223,0.005128205128205128,0.0017094017094017094,0.03418803418803419,0.21025641025641026,0.018803418803418803,0,0.010256410256410256,0.044444444444444446,0.07008547008547009,0.022222222222222223,0.011965811965811967,0.046153846153846156,0.15213675213675212,0.06837606837606838,0.013675213675213675,0.0017094017094017094,0.020512820512820513,0.13846153846153847,0.005128205128205128,0.013675213675213675,0.006837606837606838,0,0.003418803418803419,0,0,0.006837606837606838,0.07521367521367521,0.09401709401709402,0,0.003418803418803419,0.006837606837606838,0.03418803418803419,0.1076923076923077,0.10427350427350428,0,0.0547008547008547,0.008547008547008548,6,0,17,0,3,0,0,6,2,16,11,6,6,0,6,0,34,0,32,63,34,,0.20521309615767264,0,0.4224872562277152,0,0.11433841851550566,0,0,0.20521309615767264,0.07924589581061381,0.4077690184363099,0.3212813862761086,0.20521309615767264,0.20521309615767264,0,0,0,0.05457463884430177,0,0.051364365971107544,0.10112359550561797,0.10850884755755627,0.898876404494382,25

447,"  Carol Adl in News , UK // 0 Comments A Tory councillor believes that homeless people in Bradford city centre should be ‘grabbed by scruff of the neck’ and ‘dealt with’. The comments by David Heseltine, a Conservative Party Councillor in Bradford caused outrage during a meeting of the Council’s regeneration overview and scrutiny committee. He said : “The tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said they’d go into Bradford if they were eliminated.” He claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. So what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless “by the scruff of the neck” and eliminating them? EvolvePolitics reports: Why Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towards providing people with homes, opportunities for employment, improving mental health services and providing interventions for alcohol and drug addiction. The ‘Nasty Party’ Councillor said that he had spoken to people who claimed that they would not visit Bradford city centre due to the number of drinkers and beggars. Heseltine is correct in his assertion that Bradford council – like many other councils – places the town centre aesthetic above the needs of those that live in and around them. However, his suggestions for dealing with the problem of homelessness are utterly reprehensible. These are people, not dogs or vermin to be disposed of to make your town look just a little better. Most people are never more than three paychecks away from being homeless.

448,"In late July, The American Conservative ran an interview with J. D. Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine’s website. The interviewer’s last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance’s publishing debut, “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. ” Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10. After reading “Hillbilly Elegy,” you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we’re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he’s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. Imagine that. On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant. But his profile is misleading. His people  —   hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view)  —   didn’t step off the Mayflower and become part of America’s ascendant class. “Poverty is the family tradition,” he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers  —   all     occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security. Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a   steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw  —   in newscaster English, that’s grandma and grandpa  —   who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a   life (house, car) they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life. Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, “a violent nondrunk,” was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance’s mother was an empress of instability  —   violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn’t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she’d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands. The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin,   as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don’t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds. “Hillbilly Elegy,” in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells  —   most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life  —   and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes? In Mr. Vance’s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he’s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community’s problems the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he’s also convinced that it “increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. ” His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line. He could not afford a cellphone. “Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,” Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. “I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about. ” Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the “Obama economy. ” Or with a former   at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant. Squint, and you’ll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance’s argument. It’s always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can  —   just as President Obama can say to fellow   “brothers should pull up their pants,” as he did on MTV. The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view. Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his   confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn’t laziness that’s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls “learned helplessness”  —   the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot. What he’s really writing about is despair. Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He’s plumped with hope his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. “There was something almost spiritual,” he writes, “about the cynicism of the community at large. ” His friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel “rigged” and inaccessible job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck? Mr. Vance doesn’t have all the answers. But he’s advancing the conversation.",0,1118,16.686567164179106,67,0.33810375670840787,0,0,0,0,80.60893176590851,7.678206388000033,86.4386715407949,19.12184456370503,0.8032200357781754,0.008050089445438283,0.04561717352415027,0.038461538461538464,0.06082289803220036,0.03220035778175313,0.20483005366726298,0.016100178890876567,0.004472271914132379,0.022361359570661897,0.07692307692307693,0.0008944543828264759,0.07334525939177101,0.017889087656529516,0.0017889087656529517,0.012522361359570662,0.01699463327370304,0.10286225402504472,0.004472271914132379,0.06529516994633273,0.024150268336314847,0.05366726296958855,0,0.0035778175313059034,0.027728085867620753,0.008944543828264758,0.10107334525939177,0,0.013416815742397137,0.0035778175313059034,0.006261180679785331,0,0.007155635062611807,0.03935599284436494,0.006261180679785331,0.006261180679785331,0.4525939177101968,0.009838998211091235,0.005366726296958855,0.007155635062611807,0.0026833631484794273,0.04203935599284436,0.0017889087656529517,0.0035778175313059034,0.029516994633273702,0.018783542039355994,0.012522361359570662,0.0626118067978533,0.009838998211091235,0.017889087656529516,0.014311270125223614,0.03130590339892665,0,0,0.012522361359570662,0.21556350626118068,0.008944543828264758,0.0035778175313059034,0.018783542039355994,0.07245080500894455,0.06887298747763863,0.06708407871198568,0.026833631484794274,0.050983899821109124,0.12343470483005367,0.10912343470483005,0.022361359570661897,0.0026833631484794273,0.025044722719141325,0.11806797853309481,0.0035778175313059034,0.007155635062611807,0.006261180679785331,0.0035778175313059034,0.007155635062611807,0,0.0017889087656529517,0.044722719141323794,0.14579606440071557,0.06618962432915922,0.0008944543828264759,0.016100178890876567,0.009838998211091235,0.03488372093023256,0.11359570661896243,0.11896243291592129,0.0017889087656529517,0.04025044722719141,0.008050089445438283,43.125,0,140.5,2,13.75,3,5,23,2.83,63.25,16.7,18.25,69.975,0,43.125,0,148.13,14,252.5,409.63,148.13,,0.540881142286738,0,0.7933101742541434,0.051805404843482415,0.2730557858158119,0.07574607911821095,0.12017494462146865,0.38586712702252013,0.07176182298238548,0.6334120472486643,0.3132854975185913,0.3326891594035321,0.6565428467426878,0,0.6361448955484179,0,0.10419729465472731,0.009847850706583287,0.17761302167230572,0.28814107749555085,-0.8012783712838115,0.7118589225044492,106

The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there’s a good deal of overlap — enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. I’d have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I’m tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky’s analysis of how the media system is “rigged” without those doing the rigging believing they’ve done anything at all. It’s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It’s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it’s an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone’s tradition. One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I’d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. Stone’s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn’t believe it. Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone’s work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We’ve learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.

451,"Trump and Brexit Defeat Globalism, for Now Anyway   14, 2016 Trumpism as a stress test for democracy …. A series of populist anti-globalism shocks is a test for Western democracies. Trump’s stunning ascent to the White House is the clearest signal yet of an anti-establishment revolt unfolding in major democracies, stretching across the Atlantic. – Swiss Info Tech Was Trump’s victory actually created by the very globalist elites that Trump is supposed to have overcome? There are some who believe the elites are actually splintered into numerous groups and that domestic US elites have positioned themselves against the banking elites in London’s City. We see no fundamental evidence of this. The world’s real elites in our view may have substantive histories in the hundreds and thousands of years. US elites are basically in the employ of a handful of families, individuals and institutions in our view. It is confusing because it is hard to tell if Hillary, for instance, is operating on her own accord or at the behest of higher and more powerful authorities. It is probably a combination of both but at root those who control central banks are managing the world’s move towards globalism. History easily shows us who these groups are – and they are not located in America. This is a cynical perspective to be sure, and certainly doesn’t remove the impact of Trump’s victory or his courage in waging his election campaign despite what must surely be death threats to himself and his family.. But if true, this perspective corresponds to predictions that we’ve been making for nearly a decade now, suggesting that sooner or later elites – especially those in London’s City – would have to “take a step back.” More: The vote to propel Trump to the US presidency reflects a profound backlash against open markets and borders, and the simmering anger of millions of blue-collar white and working-class people who blame their economic woes on globalisation and multiculturalism. “There are a few parallels to Switzerland – that the losers of globalisation find somebody who is listening to them,” said Swiss professor and lawyer Wolf Linder, a former director of the University of Bern’s political science institute. “Trump is doing his business with the losers of globalisation in the US, like the Swiss People’s Party is doing in Switzerland,” he said. “It is a phenomenon which touches all European nations.” Again, this article presumes that Trump has “won” and that he intends to attack the larger globalist enterprise and the bankers funding it. On the other hand, it could be that both Trump and Brexit have been engineered to look as if the tide is turning against globalism when it is not. Why would those in charge want to portray this point of view when it may not be so? Because of what we call the “Internet Reformation” that has blasted open the secretive manipulations of the globalist elite in the past decade or so. It is almost impossible for globalists to promote internationalist memes in this environment. Yet it is the secretive injection of internationalist memes into the body politic that moves society toward the globalist enterprise. As we have suggested before, it is perfectly possible that a decision has been made to pretend to grant the larger society a “victory” over internationalism. Following this analysis, certain trends would be identified and encouraged that would seem to portray globalism as falling back on its metaphorical heels. In truth, if this analysis is correct, globalism’s retreat is a kind of pretense that will steer society less obviously in a globalist direction. One way this could happen is by ensuring the splintering of Europe – but not in a way that actually reduces control from Brussels. It will APPEAR to be so but won’t actually happen. The same thing could take place in the USA under Trump. Again, this is not to say that Trump is party to this plot or even approves of it. But the idea that Trump is part of a co-option is certainly a feasible alternative to an alternative analysis that takes what is happening at face value. Nonetheless, even if an alternative elite strategy has been decided on to realize globalism in another fashion, it ought to be pointed out that things have changed. And the Internet and its revelations are surely responsible. This is a very big deal and it is one that ought to be emphasized repeatedly. Brexit and Trump could be, somehow, the result of a different elite approach – but the approach HAS changed nonetheless. Think of it this way: Hillary represented the blunt approach toward the realization of further globalism. Her way included an aggressively expanded war and the pursuit of other globalist trends. Trump, rhetorically anyway, has a different approach in mind that would gut many internationalist trends. If Trump follows through on his rhetoric, the trend toward an internationalist world will be reduced. And while there is controversy over Trump’s recent staff appointments we should also bear in mind that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both seem to be failing now. If indeed Trump’s election has damped the progress of TPP, and TTIP, this is a huge event. As we’ve pointed out, both agreements effectively substituted technocratic corporatism for the current sociopolitical model of “democracy.” The elites were trying to move toward a new model of world control with these two agreements. This is similar to what happened after the advent of the Gutenberg Press when the elites of the day moved away from royal control and apparently swapped in democracy. It seems evident that internationalism is now going to take a longer time to realize than we thought. However, this observation may not be entirely accurate if Trump turns out to be something other than his rhetoric suggests – or if Brexit is denied in Europe. Additionally, one of the elite’s most powerful, operative memes today is “populism vs. globalism” that seeks to contrast the potentially freedom-oriented events of Trump and Brexit to the discarded wisdom of globalism. See here and here. The reality of these two events, the victories of both Trump and Brexit, stand as signal proof that elite stratagems have been defeated, at least temporarily. Though whether these defeats have been self-inflicted as part of a change in tactics remains to be seen. Conclusion: But the change has come. One way or another the Internet and tens of millions or people talking, writing and acting has forced new trends. This can be hardly be emphasized enough. Globalism has been at least temporarily redirected",1,1119,21.11320754716981,53,0.34048257372654156,0,0,0,0,77.90115246683611,40.593637176050045,56.3943163538874,33.47906293884846,0.838248436103664,0.03306523681858802,0.04289544235924933,0.041108132260947276,0.03485254691689008,0.020554066130473638,0.13136729222520108,0.006255585344057194,0.002680965147453083,0.01519213583556747,0.08042895442359249,0.0008936550491510277,0.09919571045576407,0.006255585344057194,0.004468275245755138,0.017873100983020553,0.017873100983020553,0.14298480786416443,0.002680965147453083,0.03395889186773905,0.02770330652368186,0.0679177837354781,0.006255585344057194,0.0017873100983020554,0.04647006255585344,0.021447721179624665,0.08668453976764968,0,0.0017873100983020554,0.004468275245755138,0.0017873100983020554,0.0017873100983020554,0.010723860589812333,0.024128686327077747,0.0017873100983020554,0.0017873100983020554,0.5183199285075961,0.0017873100983020554,0.0035746201966041107,0.0035746201966041107,0,0.07685433422698838,0.002680965147453083,0,0.02680965147453083,0.013404825737265416,0.0035746201966041107,0.00804289544235925,0.00804289544235925,0.017873100983020553,0.00804289544235925,0.01519213583556747,0,0,0.010723860589812333,0.22788203753351208,0.008936550491510277,0.0017873100983020554,0.01876675603217158,0.044682752457551385,0.0420017873100983,0.025915996425379804,0.01966041108132261,0.050044682752457555,0.13672922252010725,0.10277033065236818,0.020554066130473638,0.0017873100983020554,0.0160857908847185,0.15370866845397677,0,0.013404825737265416,0.0017873100983020554,0.0035746201966041107,0.010723860589812333,0,0,0.009830205540661306,0.0580875781948168,0.10366398570151922,0,0.040214477211796246,0.0035746201966041107,0.03395889186773905,0.13672922252010725,0.1456657730116175,0.012511170688114389,0.03395889186773905,0,62.46875,0,66,5,18,6,4,3,3.83,24.84375,4,37,21,0,62.46875,10,137.61874999999998,20,114.84375,267.61875000000003,137.61874999999998,,0.657383167099878,0,0.6696588838940651,0.13312870141159136,0.35602926828748566,0.15561117886054343,0.10941624977854181,0.08437005097678234,0.105255517382123,0.4328074543840699,0.10941624977854181,0.5319329316783875,0.3921009128209817,0,0.503373815773082,0.23497542908541055,0.10476308289600766,0.015225117637822997,0.08742548018593674,0.2037263475418572,0.49730626103053965,0.7962736524581429,73
452,"WASHINGTON  —   It must have been uncomfortable for Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the United States Olympic Committee, to sit between two gymnasts during the congressional hearing about sexual abuse on Tuesday. To his right, Jamie Dantzscher started crying during her testimony. She described how she was molested by the former U. S. A. Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar when she was a teenager. Dantzscher, 34 and a former Olympian, said Nassar abused her “all over the world. ” “In my own room, in my own bed, in my hotel room in Sydney at the Olympic Games,” she said, through tears. “I thought I was the only one. ” To Adams’s left, Jessica Howard, a former national champion in rhythmic gymnastics, testified that Nassar began assaulting her when she was 15, during what he called therapy for a hip injury. “He began to massage my legs, and then quickly moved inwards on my thighs,” she said. “He then massaged his way into me. ” Give these women credit for telling their stories. They’re a main reason Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, decided to introduce a bill that would make it mandatory for national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police. It would be a federal crime not to report abuse. Give Adams credit, too. In the past, the Olympic committee had failed to prioritize the issue of sexual assault and appeared to turn a blind eye to the issue by handing it off to the governing bodies of each Olympic sport. But on Tuesday, finally, Adams said something that was a long time coming. He said sorry. “The Olympic community failed the people it was supposed to protect,” said Adams, the head of organizational development for the national governing sports bodies, which exist under the umbrella of the United States Olympic Committee. “We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse. ” Nassar was fired by U. S. A. Gymnastics in 2015 and is currently in jail in Michigan, where he is facing multiple sexual assault charges and federal child pornography charges. He has denied any wrongdoing. You would think U. S. A. Gymnastics would also go out of its way to apologize for its role in a scandal that has shaken Olympic sports and caused the ouster of its president, Steve Penny. More than 80 athletes have accused Nassar of abusing them. But the gymnastics organization did not even have a representative in that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room. Feinstein had asked U. S. A. Gymnastics to testify, and said its board chairman, Paul Parilla, was thinking about it but backed out. Instead, Parilla provided a statement. It said that the board of directors offered “our sincere and heartfelt regrets and sympathies” to any athlete harmed and that U. S. A. Gymnastics was “appalled that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in the manner alleged. ” No apologies. Court documents released this month showed U. S. A. Gymnastics had complaint files on 54 coaches regarding sex abuse claims from 1996 to 2006. No apologies, even for its lack of a backbone and for sending only a lobbyist to the hearing. That lobbyist first identified himself as working for U. S. A. Gymnastics  —   which I figured, considering he was holding a file folder that said, “USAG 50 copies” on it. A few minutes later, he said, no, he was actually there for U. S. A. Hockey. The federation has had no shame, either. When the sex abuse bill was introduced, Penny and others from U. S. A. Gymnastics met with Feinstein about the federation’s sexual assault policies. How about this for a   stunt: Tagging along was Mary Lou Retton, the smiling, bubbly sweetheart from the 1984 Games, as they said that the federation’s policies were solid and that gymnastics was a happy, safe place. On Tuesday, Feinstein and her fellow senators weren’t thrilled that the gymnastics federation had ditched them this time. “If they really cared, they would be here,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said as he looked at Dantzscher and Howard, the abused gymnasts who testified. “They have to answer for what happened to you. ” At a news conference later, Blumenthal called for an investigation into “who knew what and when. ” Feinstein said she would like to see the gymnastics board of directors change and for its replacement to be people who make the sexual assault issue a priority. The U. S. O. C. should hasten that change. It can do so by decertifying U. S. A. Gymnastics, which would basically kick the federation out as the national governing body for the sport of gymnastics in the United States. To let U. S. A. Gymnastics back into the family, the Olympic committee could demand that the federation clean house and start new with fresh faces. The committee has used this power with other federations, and it used its influence to push out Penny when the Nassar case exploded into one of the biggest abuse scandals in sports history. It might as well go a step further, if only to show athletes and other federations that it won’t tolerate sexual abuse on its watch. When asked if U. S. A. Gymnastics knew about the abuse of gymnasts at the hands of Nassar, Feinstein said: “Do I believe they knew about it? Absolutely, yes, I do. ” But they didn’t report it, she said, and that’s the culture of the sport. If Feinstein’s bill passes, it would help change that culture. The new U. S. Center for SafeSport  —   a nonprofit formed to prevent and handle abuse in Olympic sports  —   should help, too, if it ever gets going the way it should. Last week, after many delays, including a struggle by the Olympic committee to find funding, the center finally opened for business. There should be a hotline for athletes and others to anonymously report abuse in Olympic sports. Good luck finding it on the center’s website. Feinstein said the Olympic committee should easily find money to fund the site and keep it running, whether it’s through raising money from the private sector or using its own cash. “The Olympic committee has money, so they can use it the way they want to use it,” she said. Mattie Larson was sitting in the public seats at the hearing on Tuesday. She is 24 now, but I first met Larson, a senior at U. C. L. A. when she was 15, sometime before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was quiet, and a rising star. She said she was being molested by Nassar around that time. So many years later, in 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published an article about a gymnast who accused Nassar of abusing her, Larson’s former teammate on the national team called her and said, “Read the story and tell me what you think. ” The two said they realized that Nassar had abused them. It had never occurred to them that his   “intravaginal treatment” was sexual assault. After all, he was the head doctor for U. S. A. Gymnastics. If the federation trusted him, they should, too. Now Larson replays the abuse in her head, again and again. What could she have done to stop it? What should U. S. A. Gymnastics have done to stop it? “I’m mad at myself for not knowing,” she said of the abuse. “On so many levels, it was complete betrayal. “You’d think in a sport with young girls, with young girls wearing leotards, prancing around with their legs flying all over the place, that U. S. A. Gymnastics would educate gymnasts and coaches and parents about sexual abuse. But they didn’t. And they knew they should have. ” Larson said it could have saved her and others, countless others, if the U. S. Center for SafeSport had existed when she was competing. “There are so many more victims who haven’t come forward yet,” she said. “I know them. They’re national team members, Olympians. ” At the very least, U. S. A. Gymnastics or the United States Olympic Committee could have mandated sexual abuse awareness training for athletes and their parents. The committee didn’t require its national governing bodies to run abuse education programs, or even conduct criminal background checks, until 2014. When Adams was asked why so many years had passed with no independent entity like the SafeSport center, his answer was vague. “It took too long to happen,” he said.",0,1427,10.266187050359711,139,0.3132445690259285,0,0,0,0,76.13830668280563,9.02898499083455,79.97013937553531,4.800776136769316,0.8479327259985985,0.007708479327259986,0.0322354590049054,0.04414856341976174,0.04414856341976174,0.01401541695865452,0.21163279607568325,0.019621583742116328,0.002803083391730904,0.012613875262789068,0.0861948142957253,0.001401541695865452,0.07358093903293624,0.02452697967764541,0.011913104414856343,0.011913104414856343,0.006306937631394534,0.0861948142957253,0.001401541695865452,0.06587245970567625,0.0161177295024527,0.05536089698668535,0,0,0.02592852137351086,0.023125437981779958,0.06377014716187807,0,0.002102312543798178,0.000700770847932726,0.020322354590049056,0,0.004905395935529082,0.07288016818500351,0.002102312543798178,0.002102312543798178,0.49964961457603363,0.004204625087596356,0.020322354590049056,0.004204625087596356,0.011212333566923615,0.06166783461807989,0.016818500350385426,0,0.01751927119831815,0.02102312543798178,0.039243167484232656,0.013314646110721794,0.011212333566923615,0.016818500350385426,0.01051156271899089,0.0322354590049054,0.014716187806587245,0.000700770847932726,0.01401541695865452,0.2214435879467414,0.002803083391730904,0,0.026629292221443588,0.09530483531885074,0.08829712683952348,0.0756832515767344,0.011913104414856343,0.04064470918009811,0.12473721093202522,0.1373510861948143,0.012613875262789068,0.002102312543798178,0.03153468815697267,0.1289418360196216,0,0.00350385423966363,0.006306937631394534,0.004204625087596356,0.005606166783461808,0,0.009110021023125438,0.030833917309039945,0.11282410651716888,0.06377014716187807,0,0.015416958654519973,0.014716187806587245,0.051156271899089,0.12613875262789068,0.14505956552207427,0.002102312543798178,0.039943938332165384,0.016818500350385426,9,0,263,4,5,1,6,144,4.83,64.53125,13,19.7,45.375,6,9,0,87.905,7,384.53125,470.43625000000003,87.905,,0.14580635337262185,0,0.8330015439991535,0.070514768894148,0.08661652505600048,0.01861306416187703,0.10216990956091021,0.7319836509220704,0.083918700575954,0.5503404879623124,0.1977917154255578,0.2720028740735933,0.46253490083002763,0.10216990956091021,0.4374466947589691,0,0.0490148451053111,0.0039031217306999344,0.21441032542974417,0.26230999289771245,-0.8883447019186658,0.7376900071022876,104
453,"Airbnb has capitulated to the demands of lawmakers over its operations in New York City, the company’s largest market in the United States, agreeing to drop a lawsuit in which it was pushing back against a newly passed state law that it said could have hurt its business. The   home rental service on Friday settled the lawsuit that it filed against New York City two months ago. The suit challenged a New York law that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in October. That law called for fines of as much as $7, 500 for illegally listing a property on a rental platform such as Airbnb. The company had said the large fines could have deterred hosts and impaired its revenue in New York City. Hosts in the city generated about $1 billion in revenue last year, and the company took a cut of that in fees. But Airbnb on Friday agreed that it would drop the suit as long as New York City enforces the new law only against hosts and does not fine Airbnb. The settlement takes effect on Monday. The agreement is a victory for opponents of Airbnb. The company and New York authorities have battled for years over the legality of offering   lodging through the service, and the relationship has long been inconsistent. Since 2010, it has been illegal in New York to rent out a whole apartment on Airbnb for fewer than 30 days. In October, Airbnb said it was willing to crack down on people in New York City who rent out multiple homes, bowing to pressure from politicians and tenants’ rights groups who said the company had made it harder to find affordable housing in the city. “This is an astounding   on the part of Airbnb, which clearly recognized that this was a foolhardy and frivolous lawsuit,” Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who wrote the law that Airbnb opposed, said of the settlement on Friday. In a statement, Airbnb said the settlement was “a material step forward for our hosts. ” Airbnb has been fighting with local governments around the globe that are displeased with the effects of the online rental service. Cities such as Amsterdam, Miami Beach and New Orleans have been closely watching the New York case. “I expect the city will now get down to the important business of enforcing the law against the serial lawbreakers on the site” who turn affordable housing into illegal hotels, Ms. Rosenthal said in her statement. “This is a win for everyone. ”",0,416,18.90909090909091,22,0.31009615384615385,0,0,0,0,98.09639625080801,54.22189349112425,67.59752747252747,34.08831908831909,0.8245192307692307,0.009615384615384616,0.06490384615384616,0.019230769230769232,0.03125,0.007211538461538462,0.11778846153846154,0.004807692307692308,0.002403846153846154,0.004807692307692308,0.11057692307692307,0,0.06490384615384616,0.002403846153846154,0,0.01201923076923077,0.004807692307692308,0.052884615384615384,0,0.036057692307692304,0.02403846153846154,0.036057692307692304,0,0,0.016826923076923076,0.009615384615384616,0.08413461538461539,0,0,0.004807692307692308,0.004807692307692308,0,0.004807692307692308,0.055288461538461536,0,0,0.46153846153846156,0.002403846153846154,0.016826923076923076,0.026442307692307692,0.002403846153846154,0.06971153846153846,0.002403846153846154,0,0.014423076923076924,0.014423076923076924,0.004807692307692308,0,0.03125,0.016826923076923076,0.002403846153846154,0.01201923076923077,0.002403846153846154,0,0.016826923076923076,0.21634615384615385,0.004807692307692308,0,0.02403846153846154,0.052884615384615384,0.11298076923076923,0.007211538461538462,0.016826923076923076,0.06490384615384616,0.17067307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.014423076923076924,0,0.019230769230769232,0.19471153846153846,0,0.014423076923076924,0,0.002403846153846154,0.002403846153846154,0,0,0.002403846153846154,0.06490384615384616,0.11778846153846154,0,0,0,0.0673076923076923,0.10336538461538461,0.10817307692307693,0.002403846153846154,0.06971153846153846,0,7,0,32,1,1,5,0,14,4,27,6,16,9,8,7,0,36,5,56,90,36,,0.250212886812842,0,0.6040450978957242,0.045503819962193694,0.045503819962193694,0.19248405980003652,0,0.400272448719846,0.16015261286229274,0.5627793148377791,0.22241846975351037,0.43271104029591567,0.3002384196953406,0.2760888715617666,0.08704668331836253,0,0.07531380753138076,0.010460251046025104,0.11715481171548117,0.18828451882845187,-0.5741781139787415,0.8117154811715481,28

Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with   populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers. Yet 140 miles of   roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest. Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America. “Vancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,” Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. “We should make the most of those cultural commonalities. ” Whether their grand vision of a “Cascadia innovation corridor”  —   which borrows its name from the region’s Cascade mountain range  —   ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada’s smoother immigration process. For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies. One serious obstacle to Vancouver’s tech ambitions is its   housing costs. The median price for a detached home in the metropolitan area in August was 1. 4 million Canadian dollars (about $1. 06 million) a 27. 8 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, the median single family home price was about $848, 000, according to Zillow. But while median pay for   jobs is $112, 000 a year in the San Francisco Bay Area, it is just under $49, 000 in Vancouver, according to an analysis by PayScale, a compensation data firm. (Some of that discrepancy is due to a drop in the value of Canada’s currency relative to the United States dollar.) “We have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,” said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region’s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand). Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city. Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country’s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere. Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate’s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States. “Right now, there’s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,” Mr. Smith said. Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea. At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates,   of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education. One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a   rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project  —   which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more  —   have not been worked out. A group of Seattle techies proposed a cheaper alternative: a dedicated lane for autonomous vehicles on Interstate 5, the highway connecting Seattle to the Canadian border. The plan  —   which relies on autonomous vehicles that still need a lot of work  —   would not shave much time off the commute between the cities, but could make the ride less tedious by letting travelers work or watch a movie, said Tom Alberg, a managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture capital firm, and an author of the proposal. With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver’s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech “unicorn”  —   a   valued at over $1 billion  —   in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools. But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1. 78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech   in the last decade, compared with about $8. 9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates. Still, the city’s   tech boom may hit a wall if it cannot address its    issues, which are by some standards more acute than those plaguing other thriving cities. Vancouver was ranked the third most unaffordable city in the world, after Hong Kong and Sydney, in a study published this year by Demographia, a consulting firm. Mr. Yan has spent years analyzing his hometown’s soaring real estate values and concluded that a surge in foreign capital, primarily from mainland China, has decoupled Vancouver home prices from the local economy. British Columbia recently imposed a 15 percent tax on new home purchases in the Vancouver area by foreign buyers, a move now facing legal challenges. The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when   get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver. “Companies tend to run into scaling issues,” he said. “You end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons. ”",0,1205,23.627450980392158,51,0.37344398340248963,0,0,0,0,98.63063783604728,33.37640782454059,58.52952441749122,37.51667435069925,0.7427385892116183,0.014107883817427386,0.04730290456431535,0.024066390041493777,0.019087136929460582,0.012448132780082987,0.15435684647302905,0,0.0016597510373443983,0.00995850622406639,0.09294605809128631,0,0.04149377593360996,0.0024896265560165973,0,0.012448132780082987,0.0033195020746887966,0.07053941908713693,0.0008298755186721991,0.06639004149377593,0.03402489626556016,0.043153526970954356,0,0,0.024066390041493777,0.010788381742738589,0.05975103734439834,0,0.0016597510373443983,0.0024896265560165973,0.0008298755186721991,0,0.007468879668049793,0.02074688796680498,0.0016597510373443983,0.0016597510373443983,0.4,0.0016597510373443983,0.008298755186721992,0.011618257261410789,0,0.03153526970954357,0.0008298755186721991,0.0008298755186721991,0.004979253112033195,0.010788381742738589,0.009128630705394191,0.004979253112033195,0.03236514522821577,0.015767634854771784,0.004149377593360996,0.005809128630705394,0.0008298755186721991,0,0.03568464730290456,0.1900414937759336,0.015767634854771784,0.0033195020746887966,0.015767634854771784,0.044813278008298756,0.1053941908713693,0.011618257261410789,0.012448132780082987,0.03402489626556016,0.16597510373443983,0.04398340248962656,0.03402489626556016,0,0.013278008298755186,0.16763485477178422,0,0.004149377593360996,0.0008298755186721991,0.0008298755186721991,0.004979253112033195,0,0,0.0016597510373443983,0.04564315352697095,0.1087136929460581,0,0.021576763485477178,0.005809128630705394,0.04149377593360996,0.08132780082987552,0.07551867219917012,0.0033195020746887966,0.06639004149377593,0.0008298755186721991,43,0,10.1,9,8.625,0,8.5,0,20.855,21.4,7.875,16,25.625,0,43,0,92.355,8.5,47.95,148.805,92.355,,0.5738119778652198,0,0.24026202065159807,0.21984765666462577,0.21263514338685582,0,0.21020124524970962,0,0.3950376314512668,0.40121911481448325,0.1978025016400431,0.3337683527820445,0.44516876828045165,0,0.24653530113316122,0,0.07105296563715327,0.006539442454829763,0.03689014890695143,0.11448255699893445,0.6628781417492661,0.8855174430010655,54
456,"Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now they’ve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as   of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M. I. T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year, they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts. But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses   data  —   and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  —   especially   men without college degrees. “The conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and it’s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover,” Mr. Acemoglu said. “If you’ve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you don’t have the skills to go into health care,” he said. “The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change. ” The paper’s evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who said at an Axios event last week that artificial intelligence’s displacement of human jobs was “not even on our radar screen,” and “50 to 100 more years” away. (Not all robots use artificial intelligence, but a panel of experts  —   polled by the M. I. T. Initiative on the Digital Economy in reaction to Mr. Mnuchin’s comments  —   expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement.) The paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists: why, if machines are replacing human workers, productivity hasn’t been increasing. In manufacturing, productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  —   and now we see evidence of it in the employment data, too. The study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670, 000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple. The paper adds to the evidence that automation, more than other factors like trade and offshoring that President Trump campaigned on, has been the bigger   threat to   jobs. The researchers said the findings  —   “large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages”  —   remained strong even after controlling for imports, offshoring, software that displaces jobs, worker demographics and the type of industry. Robots affected both men’s and women’s jobs, the researchers found, but the effect on male employment was up to twice as big. The data doesn’t explain why, but Mr. Acemoglu had a guess: Women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a   field. The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6. 2 workers and wages by 0. 7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places. Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0. 25 percent. The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans. David Autor, a collaborator of Mr. Acemoglu’s at M. I. T. has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans, and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy. “I don’t think that this paper is the last word on its subject, but it’s an exceedingly carefully constructed and   first word,” he said. Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. “I still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today,” he said. “But the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots. ” In addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  —   mostly in the Midwest, South and East  —   and Western Europe added 1. 6. The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies. The next question is whether the coming wave of technologies  —   like machine learning, drones and driverless cars  —   will have similar effects, but on many more people.",0,1050,17.796610169491526,59,0.3314285714285714,0,0,0,0,93.00025833118058,39.04700854700854,56.436190476190475,34.00352733686067,0.840952380952381,0.037142857142857144,0.05333333333333334,0.03142857142857143,0.030476190476190476,0.007619047619047619,0.17333333333333334,0.002857142857142857,0.0019047619047619048,0.013333333333333334,0.08285714285714285,0,0.06857142857142857,0.004761904761904762,0,0.0380952380952381,0.006666666666666667,0.11619047619047619,0.002857142857142857,0.06666666666666667,0.0380952380952381,0.06285714285714286,0,0,0.035238095238095235,0.008571428571428572,0.07523809523809524,0,0,0,0.0019047619047619048,0,0.017142857142857144,0.04476190476190476,0,0,0.44476190476190475,0.0038095238095238095,0.009523809523809525,0.0009523809523809524,0.005714285714285714,0.03428571428571429,0,0.0009523809523809524,0.02666666666666667,0.008571428571428572,0.0019047619047619048,0.011428571428571429,0.022857142857142857,0.021904761904761906,0.015238095238095238,0.012380952380952381,0,0,0.02761904761904762,0.2342857142857143,0.010476190476190476,0.0019047619047619048,0.01619047619047619,0.06,0.12095238095238095,0.022857142857142857,0.017142857142857144,0.03428571428571429,0.14952380952380953,0.05714285714285714,0.030476190476190476,0.0009523809523809524,0.017142857142857144,0.13714285714285715,0,0.009523809523809525,0.006666666666666667,0.006666666666666667,0.005714285714285714,0,0,0.002857142857142857,0.06761904761904762,0.07714285714285714,0,0.02,0.009523809523809525,0.04,0.13142857142857142,0.12380952380952381,0.002857142857142857,0.11523809523809524,0.0019047619047619048,49.5,0,30.8,2,1.625,0,0,2,10,24,11,11.4,19,0,49.5,10,80.525,10,89.55,177.075,80.525,,0.5903319506440077,0,0.47274699472150916,0.05501892529699887,0.04516884075542561,0,0,0.05501892529699887,0.22547340809847535,0.4113031023033909,0.2425518496893189,0.24917418388903553,0.35613117633464153,0,0.4803246317392769,0.22547340809847535,0.06870294136467377,0.008531877226286714,0.07640296056139752,0.15107821598447196,-0.2708996807181498,0.8489217840155281,55
457,"Email An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)—and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. With Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates—including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton’s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City—and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon’s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company’s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line—and that caused JP Morgan’s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the “massive bribery scheme” that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup—and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present—bringing Hillary Clinton’s total “cash grab” from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million—all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton’s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS. To what Jamie Dimon said to Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this “megabanks” master plan to save itself had “serious deficiencies” that could “pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States”. Two months after the FDIC’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically “sounded a warning” that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “someone is going to get hurt”. Unbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse—and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that “this market is scary”, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a “Red Alert” warning all of its clients warning them to “prepare for a severe market crash”. With one of the first casualties of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is “nearing its doom” and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe—who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers. As Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the “Clinton Crime Story of the Century”, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.",1,836,76,11,0.38636363636363635,0,0,0,0,92.56569079549065,8.284963118022327,79.20547581073897,9.561106155218555,0.7416267942583732,0.009569377990430622,0.028708133971291867,0.017942583732057416,0.03110047846889952,0.011961722488038277,0.1674641148325359,0.0011961722488038277,0.0011961722488038277,0.01076555023923445,0.07416267942583732,0.0011961722488038277,0.04665071770334928,0.0011961722488038277,0.0011961722488038277,0.013157894736842105,0.009569377990430622,0.03827751196172249,0,0.045454545454545456,0.014354066985645933,0.03708133971291866,0.014354066985645933,0.0035885167464114833,0.0011961722488038277,0.0011961722488038277,0.06578947368421052,0,0.0011961722488038277,0.0035885167464114833,0.004784688995215311,0,0.007177033492822967,0.03110047846889952,0,0,0.388755980861244,0,0.004784688995215311,0,0,0.06818181818181818,0.0011961722488038277,0,0.014354066985645933,0.01076555023923445,0,0.009569377990430622,0.05861244019138756,0.011961722488038277,0.0011961722488038277,0.0215311004784689,0,0,0.0430622009569378,0.1686602870813397,0.02751196172248804,0.011961722488038277,0.011961722488038277,0.017942583732057416,0.12320574162679426,0.03110047846889952,0.008373205741626795,0.03827751196172249,0.12081339712918661,0.09928229665071771,0.01076555023923445,0,0.03588516746411483,0.1255980861244019,0.0035885167464114833,0.0011961722488038277,0.011961722488038277,0.004784688995215311,0.0035885167464114833,0.0035885167464114833,0,0.013157894736842105,0.07535885167464115,0.05980861244019139,0,0.0023923444976076554,0.009569377990430622,0.05382775119617225,0.08492822966507177,0.07775119617224881,0.008373205741626795,0.09330143540669857,0,21.675,0,56.3,0,3,20,3,5.2,1.83,124.80000000000001,3,6,16.3,8,21.675,10,49.129999999999995,34,170.87500000000003,236.33,49.129999999999995,,0.5937152959802368,0,0.7914818338039009,0,0.16823313233447382,0.5741781139787415,0.16823313233447382,0.25957952044877125,0.10982813594193673,0.893775389554239,0.16823313233447382,0.2880129448105867,0.5235703506386822,0.3503793320098116,0.706332183743888,0.40269974784927715,0.04819832635162312,0.03335524314991219,0.16763462274238963,0.23184837098878674,-0.9206848406694149,0.7681516290112133,53
458,"We had made it to Tete, Mozambique. The sun was sinking behind the Zambezi River like a scoop of orange sherbet as we sat on the motel’s deck taking in the quiet close of another long day on the road. But we avoided one another’s eyes. The table in front of us was cluttered with maps, notebooks, competing spreadsheets and empty beer bottles. “I don’t know, man,” Robert said. “Mozambique’s interesting, but it kind of reminds me of Spain in the ’80s. Maybe we should go our separate ways. ” For days, tensions had been building. It was hard traveling with another family, facing the endless   of a road trip, especially this one. Robert and his wife, two Dutch friends whose children are about the same age as ours, were hankering to go west to see Botswana’s Kalahari Desert and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. I had promised our two boys, Apollo, 6, and Asa, 4, that we would hit the beach in Mozambique, fabled for its pristine coastline. But this wasn’t just a quibble over the route, which, in the spirit of this trip, we had always intended to be flexible. We were getting on one another’s nerves. No. That’s too soft. We were annoying the bejesus out of one another. We were locking horns over everything  —   when to stop and fill up the jerrycans, which little guesthouse to sleep in, whether to get chicken and chips or omelets, again, for dinner, great chunks of silence sitting between us at meals. And now as we contemplated the nuclear option, breaking up, we were staring down the most treacherous road of the entire trip: Mozambique’s Tete corridor, where a conflict that had claimed thousands of lives was reawakening. Some people had just been ambushed, the motel manager told us. “By who?” I asked. He just shrugged. “Bandits? Rebels? Rogue police officers?” It was all the same to him. “And from Inchope to Save,” he said offhandedly, mentioning two towns on our map. “Meu Deus,” he said, closing his eyes. “That’s even worse. ” The next morning my wife, Courtenay, and our sons jumped into our truck. “Roll ’em up, lock ’em up,” I said as we swung out of the parking lot. We headed down a long, bright highway by ourselves. I’d told Robert that we would meet him in Cape Town, though who knew if either of us would actually make it. Cape Town was still nearly 2, 000 miles away. This odyssey  —   driving across the bottom half of Africa, without any firm plans  —   started out as a lark. We were at a birthday party at Robert’s house at the time, (which was late last year) we all lived in Nairobi, Kenya. During the festivities, Robert abruptly turned down the music and called everyone outside. He has worked all over the world for the United Nations and other international organizations and speaks about 38 languages. You know what military officers call “command presence”? Well, Robert has it in spades: tall, handsome, confident, topped by a wicked crest of pure white hair. He also has an awesome smile. The instant he told everyone to go outside, I knew what he was up to. He was going to give his wife a car, and I could tell from the glint in his eye that this was as much a selfie gift as anything. Stepping into the driveway, everyone gasped and started laughing: He had bought her an old green Land Rover Defender, the ultimate safari vehicle, and wrapped it in Christmas lights adorned with Chinese lanterns. Maybe we had all had a little too much to drink, but in the glow of the moment I swung my arm around Robert’s back and mumbled, with Champagne breath: “With a car like that, you can’t just drive to the mall. Hey, man. Why don’t we drive to Cape Town?” Of course, we could have flown to Cape Town. But we were all hopelessly smitten by the historical, romantic and mystical experience of traveling Africa overland: covering all of that beautiful countryside, savoring the long distances, losing time, not just passing through landscapes but being absorbed by them. I think each of us was also a bit worn down by the rigors of our jobs and of being mommies and daddies to young children. We believed, perhaps naïvely, that turning our Christmas vacation into a challenge could rejuvenate us. It was the most ambitious road trip any of us had ever planned: 4, 250 miles one way, 16 days, six countries, five young children, four hardheaded adults and two questionable trucks. “Sounds like a bad Christmas carol,” Courtenay muttered. To be honest, she was never into it. Most areas we intended to pass through in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa were relatively safe for drivers, northern Mozambique being the one question mark. But it wasn’t as though we had AAA for back up. You break down in rural Malawi or back roads Tanzania, where there aren’t any spare parts or much transport, and you might as well get comfortable for a week. And our truck was no spring chicken. It was a Nissan Patrol, sturdy as heck but 11 years old and with more than 100, 000 miles and a few rattles. This all might sound risky, maybe even reckless, but I’ve lived in East Africa for more than a decade and felt comfortable traveling here, knowing the region was more accessible than most people appreciate. As the   date approached, our mountain of gear stupidly grew. (When you take a road trip, you’re the worst packer. You think: “Oh, yeah. We’ll have all the room in the world.) Soon we were running out of space in our operational staging area. Our guest room was heaped with mosquito nets, tarps, sleeping bags, bed rolls, tin dishes, flats of water, a monstrous medical kit containing everything from malaria prophylaxis to Tums, copies of our passports, visas and this thing called a “Carnet de Passages,” a very   customs document that allows you to cross borders in your own vehicle. We’d also packed too many clothes, a satellite transmitter, spark plugs, granola, nuts, fuses, boxed milk, an air pump, a tow rope and seven packages of Huggies, for the long rides. Little did we know that within a few days, in Malawi, we would enter the dominion of Shoprite, a South African chain, where we could have bought many of these supplies if we had actually needed them. As we pulled out of our driveway, car stuffed, I looked up to see dark clouds and bright sunshine, the dramatic, schizophrenic lighting that often illuminates Nairobi’s equatorial skies. We passed zebras in Kajiado, an area that used to be rural but in the frenzied urbanization of Nairobi in the last 10 years is now more like a suburb. By midday, we reached the Tanzanian border. We spent the next hour and a half waiting in lines, to get our passports stamped, to get our yellow fever cards checked, to show our Carnet de Passages. Then we were free, out on the road again chugging past trucks with inspirational messages emblazoned on their backsides such as “Love Your Enemies. ” We crossed into Tanzania that same day, and the landscape immediately opened up: lush, green savanna unrolling from the sides of the highway. We passed through a string of villages, each specializing in a particular commodity. In the first, everyone along the road sold chickens. In the next, eggs. The village after that, oranges. We motored through spiky sisal fields that ran for miles and miles and ended in a town where dozens of people were selling wooden   stools  —   they were actually carving them along the road, flakes of wood shavings littering the highway’s shoulders  —   being gently stirred by the wind of our passing wheels. In rural Africa the economy isn’t hidden, as it is in the United States. You drive right through it. Robert was right behind me as I took a curve, perhaps a little fast. Ahead, I saw a man in a white uniform step out from under a mango tree into the road. Shoot. A police officer. He had his arm up, which meant stop. In eastern Africa, most traffic officers don’t have guns, radios or cars. You could blow past them and probably never get in trouble. It’s essentially an honor system: You stop because it’s the right thing to do. The officer sauntered up to my window with a black plastic object that I could have sworn was an old hair dryer. It was actually a radar gun, one that looked like it belonged in “Smokey and the Bandit. ” I had been speeding, he said. I don’t think the radar gun even had batteries, but I knew the game. In East Africa, it’s called “kitu kidogo,” “a little something” in Swahili  —   a euphemism for a bribe. You have to always let them make the first move. “Do you know the fine?” the officer asked. Earnestly, I told him I did not. “Twenty thousand shillings,” he said. “But,” he smiled, “if you don’t need a receipt, I make it 10. ” Who was I to argue? Soon we were whizzing past baboons shrieking from trees. Our boys kept a running tally of all the animals we saw: monkeys, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, gazelles, antelope, warthogs, even elephants. Tanzania is rightly celebrated for its wildlife. If we’d had the time  —   which we didn’t  —   we could have gone from national park to national park and made our drive one endless safari. We did camp one night next to Mikumi National Park, home to all the big wildlife species. The   Lodge was perfect: a clean spot for tents, showers and a nearby restaurant, $7 for each adult, free for children. A few bites into dinner, I could tell that the food  —   burgers, chips and roast chicken  —   was fresh and had been made with care. As we bedded down, I heard lions grunting in the distance. Or maybe it was just Robert snoring in the tent next to me. “Man, never in my life did I think I’d be here,” Robert said, smiling in the doorway of a border town barbershop where we went looking to change money. “Malawi was always distant in my memory, like this little country lost in the middle of Africa. ” One of the most pleasant African countries, Malawi is also one that Western tourists rarely visit. It is small, green, landlocked and friendly. Never aggressively colonized like Kenya or South Africa, its raison d’être is the lake. Lake Malawi is home to a thousand kinds of fish, more than any other lake in the world. It’s a beautiful place to swim and snorkel, with little industry or pollution. Scientists say you can catch bilharzia, an infection caused by a parasitic worm, but the risks are minimal along isolated beaches, where most tourists tend to go. As soon as we crested a hill and for the first time spotted Lake Malawi sunning itself, Courtenay said: “Can I sit in a beach chair just once on this trip? Is that asking too much?” Robert and company supplied the answer: Butterfly Space, a small   on Nkhata Bay. It sounded amazing, from the guidebooks: “spacious beachfront,” “picturesque beauty,” an “oasis. ” We booked it from the road, calling just a few hours ahead. We did that a lot, conducting a little internet research the night before or flicking through a guidebook, which gave us flexibility, because we didn’t know how far we would get each day. We rolled in at night, always a   in the dark it’s hard to tell what you’re getting. A guard steered us to a campsite that smelled of dog poop. As I was helping Robert set up his tent, I noticed garbage strewed everywhere. But I didn’t want to sound negative about a place he had picked, so I kept my mouth shut. “Hey, mon. ” It was a voice from the bushes. “Uh, yeah?” I answered, looking around. A young man stepped out, dreadlocked and  . “Name’s Happy. ” “Happy what?” Robert growled. Robert and I hadn’t eaten for hours, and the two of us were dangerously crabby. We just wanted to get the tents up and find some food. “Happy Coconut, mon,” the young man answered. “Happy Coconut. I’m soooo happy. ” Robert shook his head and whispered, “I think the guy writing the guidebook was high when he passed through here. ” Butterfly Space slithered with tattooed travelers smelling of patchouli oil and Malawi Gold (the cheap and potent local ganja). We weren’t prudes, but it didn’t seem to be the ideal family spot. The next morning we hit the road. We tended to drive about 10 hours a day, starting around 8 a. m. and by dusk we would find a small hotel or guesthouse, usually for no more than $50, sometimes for as little as $10. Road trips are as much about what is happening inside the car as out. Our collective brood, all boys between ages 4 and 7, did surprisingly well, napping, looking out the windows and pulling each other’s hair only occasionally. The roads were tarmac all through Malawi and Tanzania. The only problem was gas. Malawi has few fuel stations, and I ran out twice, rescued by Robert. I think our best day of the entire trip was shortly before we split up. We had treated ourselves to a classy old whitewashed hotel, the Sunbird Livingstonia Beach Hotel, on Salima Bay. It wasn’t even that expensive, around 90, 000 Kwacha a night, or about $125, and we took the day off from driving to swim in the   lake and get tossed around by the waves. I didn’t want to leave. But Robert and his team hadn’t signed up for a beach holiday, and driving all the way to Cape Town had been my great idea, after all. When we told the room steward that we had to go, he shook his head wistfully. “It’d be great to see other countries, see how other people live,” he said, folding a sheet. “In Malawi, everyone’s born in Malawi. They live in Malawi. They die in Malawi. They don’t see anything else. ” The instant we crossed the border, it felt as though we were in a different place. This is a huge benefit of arriving in a new country by land. You immediately get a sense of its development, its atmosphere, its spirit, which is hard to do in an antiseptic international airport. One of the few former Portuguese colonies in Africa (most of the continent was grabbed up by France or England) Mozambique has a palpable Latin vibe. The storefront colors were zanier, the clothes tighter, the music louder. As we cruised through a tiny village blasting salsa, Courtenay turned to me and asked, “Is this country deaf?” We were without comrades now. We had emerged unscathed from the scorched wastes of Tete and were flying downhill toward the legendary Praia do Bilene beach, on Mozambique’s southern coast. When we pulled in, I couldn’t even hear Courtenay’s yelling which way to go because of the roar of motorcycle engines. Young South Africans raced around on Ninja bikes, shirtless or in bikinis. We discovered that Mozambique during Christmas is a bit of a South African colony. After getting the keys to a rundown rondoval at a seaside hotel, we scampered to the beach, to sand that sparkled  —   but not in the way you might imagine. It was the day after New Year’s. Thousands of beer bottles lay at the water’s edge, as though they had been vomited up by the sea. The place was a pigsty, but our boys loved it, collecting dozens of dirty bottles and making giant bottle castles. In Kenya, you’d never see that. Poor people would have been all over that beach, scooping up the empties to make money from recycling. Courtenay and I found the whole scene depressing and consoled ourselves with heaping plates of rice, pãozinho (Portuguese rolls) and shrimp so succulent and tasty that even the boys  —   who usually flee at the sight of anything unusual on their plates, especially if that unusual thing has eyes  —   gobbled it up. But our clock was ticking. Robert was somewhere out there, chugging his way south. Though we’d had our disagreements, I missed seeing that dark green Land Rover behind me. As we hustled toward the Swaziland border, a wall of brown, stubbly mountains rising before us, I guess I started to zone out. I didn’t see her until it was too late. A corpulent police officer stepped out from under a tree. That was always their strategy: Hang out in the shade and wait for a victim. It was the equivalent of the American patrol officer on a motorcycle hiding behind a billboard. She walked into the road, arm up. When I pulled over, she fanned her face. “Que calor, que calor,” she said. (How hot.) “Indeed,” I responded. She asked for my license. I gave it to her. She asked for my insurance. I gave her that as well (a special Mozambican policy covering who knows what that I had spent $60 on at the border). She frowned. The boys stirred in the back seat, as she made a leisurely loop around the truck. She returned to my window. “You pay fine,” she said. “For what?” I asked. Her eyes darted around. “Baby no have seatbelt. ” “What? He just took it off. We’ve been stopped for three minutes. ” “Baby no seatbelt. We go police station Matola. ” “Matola?” I said incredulously. “Isn’t that an hour away?” “Then pay fine here,” she said, staring into my face. “Three hundred meticals. ” After I handed it over, she waved happily goodbye. The Kingdom of Swaziland is a strange little place: population 1. 4 million per capita income $8, 500, not bad by   standards and one of the world’s lowest life expectancies, at 52 years. AIDS destroyed this place, possibly because it is a country in between. In Africa, transit points have become H. I. V. hot zones   truckers are some of the worst culprits for spreading the virus. Swaziland’s roads were good, its landscape barren and windswept. We drove end to end in 2 hours 48 minutes 7 seconds. By the time we reached South Africa, we had six days of vacation left and more than 1, 000 miles to go. I had visited South Africa nearly a dozen times, but I had never driven the country. The landscape was dreamy: rippling green hills, tall trees and miles and miles of farms and vineyards stocked with grapes so plump and juicy, you just wanted to pull over and pluck them. I found myself asking: “How did this happen? How did South Africa get all the good land?” We caught one of the most beautiful sunsets I’d ever seen. Over the west side of the N2 highway, fingers of light reached into a cool, dark forest. We made three stops on the way to Cape Town, our favorite being St. Lucia, a   town sporting carpets of crab grass for front lawns. It felt like Boca Raton, Fla. except for the   hippos lumbering through the neat little streets at night. Set in a large estuary filled with life, St. Lucia is a great place for a boat tour to see hippos and crocodiles, which we enjoyed, booking through Hornbill House, the    where we stayed. We were all eager to get to Cape Town, arguably one of the world’s most stunning cities. Our boys were excited to see the penguins at the Simon’s Town penguin colony. I was ready to stop driving. Courtenay just wanted the trip to end. As we curved around a mountain near the penguins, bubbling with the sense of triumph at having made it, a familiar green Land Rover hurtled toward us. I tooted madly. We pulled over and hugged, a lot, in a parking lot. It was great to see Robert, his wife and their children, and we were sorry that we hadn’t been able to stay together the whole time. But we had adventures to share and the children were talking fast: “We saw crocodiles!” “Well, we saw a castle!” I wished I had seen more. Driving across Africa was far more doable than I expected: The roads were safe, the border crossings not too hellish, and it was no sweat booking hotels by cellphone on the fly. But we should have taken two months, not two weeks. Then we could have explored more wildlife parks, slipped off the main roads and lingered in small, charming towns, as opposed to getting up at the crack of dawn and strapping in again. Robert, God bless him, arranged for two couples to fly to Cape Town and drive our vehicles back to Nairobi, because they wanted to have the same road trip experience. On that final Sunday, we loaded into our trucks one last time and drove to the airport, his truck right behind mine. Then eight hours later, we were all back home.",0,3579,13.98046875,256,0.26543727298127967,0,0,0,0,82.68217430329751,56.18333985284529,79.7398559498308,46.911427773120984,0.8206202849958089,0.006985191394244202,0.054484492875104776,0.038558256496227995,0.035764179938530316,0.044705224923162895,0.21234981838502376,0.003073484213467449,0.0019558535903883767,0.019558535903883765,0.08046940486169321,0.0013970382788488405,0.06705783738474434,0.017882089969265158,0.006705783738474434,0.008102822017323274,0.013411567476948869,0.0832634814193909,0.005588153115395362,0.07991058955015368,0.025984911986588432,0.05280804694048617,0,0.0002794076557697681,0.025146689019279127,0.010896898575020955,0.09052808046940486,0.0005588153115395362,0.002794076557697681,0.004749930148086058,0.006146968426934898,0,0.004749930148086058,0.0701313215982118,0.0022352612461581448,0.0022352612461581448,0.4858899133836267,0.0044705224923162895,0.009220452640402346,0.005308745459625594,0.02207320480581168,0.041911148365465216,0.005308745459625594,0.006146968426934898,0.012014529198100027,0.012014529198100027,0.014529198100027941,0.013970382788488405,0.005588153115395362,0.029617211511595416,0.012573344509639563,0.012014529198100027,0.0011176306230790724,0.0019558535903883767,0.024029058396200054,0.24308466051969824,0.005308745459625594,0.0019558535903883767,0.034925956971221014,0.06594020676166527,0.03436714165968147,0.0857781503213188,0.02347024308466052,0.024308466051969825,0.14082145850796313,0.12796870634255378,0.02207320480581168,0.005308745459625594,0.028220173232746577,0.18552668343112602,0.002794076557697681,0.010896898575020955,0.006985191394244202,0.003073484213467449,0.01732327465772562,0,0.0002794076557697681,0.014529198100027941,0.09863090248672814,0.10813076278290025,0.0002794076557697681,0.02039675887119307,0.0044705224923162895,0.050293378038558254,0.11874825370215143,0.1366303436714166,0.03827884884045823,0.00866163732886281,0.006426376082704666,213.4,5,84.5,2,30.35,27.75,29.35,66.95,0.73,81.375,47.6,88,109.73,3,213.4,10,476.19000000000005,73.1,291.375,830.665,476.19000000000005,,0.7488923430945176,0.06531322402354589,0.5414786233587767,0.027190842564500887,0.2978288172845709,0.27944444351667425,0.2908700251358118,0.48337892965794826,0.010099029243570113,0.5321090619302239,0.39948243431795494,0.551536804634372,0.6052927666219188,0.04023919503814905,0.5427239749189688,0.12261787904381129,0.11363113014282937,0.017443532231757965,0.06952953767480817,0.19821794393013997,0.7850722887048306,0.8017820560698601,219

460,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  —   It was Nov. 12, and Bill Maher was about to begin his comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when he did something he hadn’t done in many years. He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie (tequila). “And boy did I miss it,” he joked with me last week. “What an idiot all those years  —   drinking’s fun. You hear that, kids? Drinking’s fun!” Actually, that’s not why he did it, he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking  —   and, in his case, a wee bit of pot smoking  —   that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge (oh, the indignities of this job). He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional. But that night, so soon after the election, he needed something to calm his nerves. Donald J. Trump, who Mr. Maher said “lives for vengeance,” had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government, like the Justice Department, and, more to the point, the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that “no one’s been meaner to him than me. ” Mr. Maher has a unique perspective. He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion, dodging traffic from left and right. He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth. But first, a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a   totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his   ABC show, “Politically Incorrect. ” He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldn’t be called “cowards,” especially when the United States’ preferred method of attack at the time  —   before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  —   was to lob cruise missiles from afar (“That’s cowardly,” he said). The White House criticized him, sponsors fled and, a few months later, ABC canceled his show. Whatever you might think of his argument, the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse. It could have been a   too, if HBO hadn’t provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show, “Real Time,” which has an audience of about 4. 5 million viewers. Yet, Mr. Maher puts that episode within “the normal parameters of awful. ” He says he’s more worried about our new era, when no one knows what “normal” is going to look like. It’s amazing how much anxiety Mr. Trump’s imminent inauguration is stirring in the   business  —   but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press, his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him. No one knows whether a year from now, we’ll see today’s fears as overblown, underblown, or on point. Mr. Maher is taking the    approach based on his own experience in the Trumpian combat caldron in 2013. That was when Mr. Maher launched a “birther” —   or, “ ”  —   campaign about Mr. Trump, to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President Obama’s citizenship. Appearing on “The Tonight Show,’’ he joked that Mr. Trump was the product of   crossbreeding it was the only thing, he said, that would explain the “color of his hair. ” He said he would donate $5 million to a charity of Mr. Trump’s choice if he could prove this wasn’t the case. (Mr. Maher pledged $1 million in 2012 to a “super PAC” supporting Obama.) Mr. Trump’s lawyers replied with a copy of his   birth certificate and a demand for the money, which Mr. Maher ignored. Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere. “It was worth it in comedy material,” Mr. Maher told me, taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head (a gift from a friend) as we stood by the bar in his   living room. “But you definitely spent money. ” That is, Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford. He takes it as a harbinger. “No one knows what this man is capable of,” Mr. Maher said. “I never, ever, ever felt worried  —   it never crossed my mind  —   that George Bush would do something crazy, even though I knew he hated me. He never sued me for a joke. ” Mr. Maher was particularly focused on reports that several F. B. I. agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton, which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump. (The Justice Department’s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. ’s   performance.) “It is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized,” he said. “When the internal police department is politicized, that’s a place I don’t want to be on the wrong side of  —   I mean, that’s fascism. ” You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia, and it’s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism. But with so many sharing similar worries (at least among those who didn’t support Mr. Trump) and with Mr. Trump’s continued cage rattling, I turned to Mr. Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for a response. It seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of Mr. Maher’s, dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the   trail on Comedy Central. Given Mr. Trump’s preference for Twitter, Ms. Conway joked, using the F. B. I. would be “so last century  —   it’s so bureaucratic and paperwork laden. ” Turning more serious, she said, “He’s not going to use the ‘tools of state,’” repeating the wording of my question. I noted that there are, of course, guidelines, professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a president’s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon, and she agreed, saying “This is America. ” Ms. Conway acknowledged, though, that Mr. Maher’s fears were widely held, especially in Hollywood  —   witness Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes address. “Talk about a Hollywood story  —   folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable,” she said. She described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by “the elites” to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks. “Where’s the respect  —   open ear and open mind? ’’ she said. “The same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets,” she said. It was time, she said, to “take the poison out of the pen and keyboard. ” Mr. Maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day, Jan. 20 (his birthday, and Ms. Conway’s). But he shares Ms. Conway’s view of the cultural stakes in the election. “We’re the losers now, so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more,” he said. Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. Streep’s  —   calling actors, screenwriters and the news media to arms  —   weren’t going to solve anything. “It looks very insular,” he said. “Just the liberals talking to themselves, which they are very good at doing. ” Still the bane of conservatives, Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism, for which he says liberals have too much tolerance. That’s part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left. At the same time, his restaurant selection, the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel, came in defiance of a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. To join the boycott, Mr. Maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby, would be to submit to an ineffectual form of “tokenism. ” “As if the sultan of Brunei is up there looking at the receipts  —   we only sold two soups? Is Stallone still coming in?” he said. “But Sultan, your harem awaits  —   ‘I’m sorry, I’m still going over the receipts. ’” With that, we took our seats and the waiter approached. Surprised to see Mr. Maher, he asked “You’re not in hiding?” That got Mr. Maher all worked up again. “I can be scared,” he said, “and never pull a punch. ”",0,1455,15.64516129032258,93,0.24948453608247423,0,0,0,0,78.8036761096191,5.007445589919815,81.97538775889291,24.67611683848797,0.8185567010309278,0.010996563573883162,0.04742268041237113,0.04398625429553265,0.04742268041237113,0.012371134020618556,0.2652920962199313,0.009621993127147767,0.007560137457044674,0.03436426116838488,0.07766323024054983,0.0006872852233676976,0.06529209621993128,0.01443298969072165,0.0027491408934707906,0.013745704467353952,0.013058419243986255,0.08041237113402062,0,0.06735395189003436,0.02268041237113402,0.04742268041237113,0,0.0013745704467353953,0.019243986254295534,0.012371134020618556,0.09072164948453608,0.0006872852233676976,0.0006872852233676976,0.0013745704467353953,0.008934707903780068,0,0.010309278350515464,0.06048109965635739,0.0013745704467353953,0.0013745704467353953,0.46872852233676976,0.0027491408934707906,0.019243986254295534,0.0027491408934707906,0.015120274914089347,0.052920962199312714,0.006185567010309278,0.006872852233676976,0.018556701030927835,0.01993127147766323,0.01993127147766323,0.06666666666666667,0.010309278350515464,0.01443298969072165,0.015807560137457044,0.024054982817869417,0.004123711340206186,0.0006872852233676976,0.01718213058419244,0.24261168384879725,0.015120274914089347,0.005498281786941581,0.03230240549828179,0.0865979381443299,0.061855670103092786,0.07697594501718213,0.02336769759450172,0.05910652920962199,0.12714776632302405,0.12989690721649486,0.018556701030927835,0.003436426116838488,0.05223367697594502,0.11752577319587629,0.0006872852233676976,0.008247422680412371,0.003436426116838488,0.0027491408934707906,0.010996563573883162,0,0.002061855670103093,0.04673539518900344,0.13195876288659794,0.05429553264604811,0.0006872852233676976,0.015807560137457044,0.004810996563573883,0.04879725085910653,0.13676975945017184,0.1457044673539519,0.006185567010309278,0.030240549828178694,0.004123711340206186,46.25,19.73,117.75,3,16,7.5,20,36.75,3.83,126.75,28.5,18.48,42.03,0,46.25,12,153.94,40.5,263,452.44,153.94,,0.5174667847223335,0.3138834950694627,0.7319223691883601,0.06503681897195406,0.27060067137851024,0.1481401966972792,0.31681804528350205,0.4600782450925091,0.0815627381345355,0.7461249303928005,0.3978906640060377,0.2999624204270188,0.49355479843503136,0,0.49337632124184655,0.21767634479507447,0.08602691344778254,0.02263277896995708,0.1469733547925608,0.25283887696709584,-0.7814789552723949,0.7471611230329042,118
461,"Lydia Ko could win her second consecutive ANA Inspiration title this week, or be eclipsed by Michelle Wie winning her first in her 13th career start, and it would still be   for the women in one respect. As the top golfers on the L. P. G. A. Tour compete in their first major tournament of the year, they will be   to ignore the storm clouds gathering in advance of their third, the United States Women’s Open, to be held in July at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Before Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he was the Daddy Warbucks of women’s golf, hosting the top players every year at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. during the L. P. G. A.’s   ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. In 2006, the tournament’s   prize was $1 million, a milestone that the men had reached seven years earlier. In his prepolitics life as a real estate mogul, Trump dispensed business advice to the L. P. G. A. players and invited them to his courses for informal rounds of golf. The women generally accepted his invitations for the same reason they play   events every year with dozens of other golfers, including those who harbor different political and personal beliefs: These people, usually men, sustain the Tour with their support. “Having played in the ADT Championship when it was held at his course in West Palm Beach, I have experienced nothing but good things from him and his golf course,” said Karen Stupples, a reporter for the Golf Channel and NBC who competed in the event in 2004 and 2008. “And I think the L. P. G. A. in general feels that same way, that he was very respectful to the L. P. G. A. to the tournament. ” The picture that L. P. G. A. golfers paint of Trump as a respectful supporter of women stands in stark contrast to the leering,   man caught conversing with Billy Bush during a taping of a 2005 segment for “Access Hollywood” in a video that surfaced shortly before the election. Since Trump became the putative leader of the free world, he has often been seen on the golf course, and for some of those outings, he has reached out to some of the best players in the game to accompany him. The top men and women have accepted invitations to play with him with their eyes wide open. They know that what they see as a social outing will be spun as a political statement  —   and they seem largely not to care. In an anonymous survey I conducted in February of 56 players on the PGA Tour, 50 (or 89 percent) said they would play with Trump if extended an invitation. Three said they would not, and three declined to answer. How would the best women, whose ranks cut across more cultures than the men’s, respond? At the Founders Cup in   the first L. P. G. A. event of the year held in the United States, I conducted an anonymous survey of 40 players.   (or 60 percent) said they would play with Trump, nine said they would not and seven declined to comment. A   joked, “I want to stay in the country so I’ll say yes. ” The women, who ranged in age from under 20 to over 50, represented 12 countries and make their homes in 11 states, including four that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election. One player, Natalie Gulbis, spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Another, the Floridian Lexi Thompson, has played golf with Trump since the election. Ko, the women’s No. 1 from New Zealand, has not played a round with Trump  —   but only because she hasn’t received an invitation. “He’s the leader of one of the biggest countries in the whole entire world,” Ko said, “and it would be an honor if I got that call. ” Ryann O’Toole, an American who was raised in California, said, “I didn’t vote for him and I’ll still play with him. ” Ko is 19. Thompson is 22. O’Toole is 30. Stupples is 43 and the mother of a    son. It is unfair, Stupples said, to expect a consensus on any political issue from a tour membership that includes women under 20 and over 40 and Americans and foreigners. “Lydia and Lexi have both led a very sheltered life,” Stupples said. “They’ve played golf and that’s it. They probably haven’t seen much of what goes on outside of the golf course and a hotel. ” She added: “Would I play golf with him? Probably not. But then that’s me. That’s because I’ve been around the block a few times and seen a few other things. But it’s only because of my life experience that I feel like I can make a good judgment on what I want to do personally. ” The United States Golf Association awarded its flagship women’s event to Trump’s Bedminster course in 2012, when his reputation as an opportunistic outsider came from supporting golf when the economy was cratering and other benefactors were bailing. “He was such a huge fan of the L. P. G. A. and of golf in general,” said Gulbis, who has known Trump since she qualified for her first ADT Championship in 2005. Throughout the years, she said, he has counseled her to fight for the same pay as PGA Tour members for public appearances or sponsorships. “These were constant conversations that I saw him have not just with me, but with lots of people in our organization,” Gulbis said. The United States Women’s Open will not be the first golf major played at a Trump course. The Women’s British Open in 2015 was held at Turnberry, a Scottish resort that Trump bought in 2014, after the tournament had been awarded. In the past few years, some other top golf events have been given to   courses. This year’s Senior P. G. A. Championship will be at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, and the 2022 P. G. A. Championship will be hosted by his Bedminster club. Shaunna Thomas, the   of UltraViolet, a national group assembled to fight sexism and expand women’s rights, said her organization failed to see the upside of any professional women’s sports league aligning itself with Trump. “I’ve been playing golf all my life, I’m very familiar with how deeply ingrained sexism is in the game,” Thomas said in a telephone interview. “It’s upsetting. People who aren’t fans think it’s such an easy decision for the U. S. G. A. and the L. P. G. A. to make to avoid controversy. ” She added: “The question really is, do the U. S. G. A. and L. P. G. A. want to be on the right side of history? If the U. S. G. A. wants to stay relevant to a younger generation of golfers, they’re going to have to take a look at their decision. This is an opportunity to send a clear signal to women, people of color and people with disabilities that they stand on the side of inclusiveness. ” UltraViolet staged a protest on the third day of the Founders Cup, calling for the Women’s Open to be moved from Bedminster or, barring that, for the players to boycott the event. Roughly a dozen people gathered outside the public entrance to Wildfire Golf Club, the tournament site on a Marriott property in Phoenix, and handed out items including “Dump Trump” golf balls before being escorted away by hotel security. The organization also commissioned a plane to fly over the tournament grounds with a banner that read: “LPGA: Take a Mulligan. Dump Sexist Trump. ” On the eve of the protest, the L. P. G. A. one of the world’s oldest women’s professional sports organizations, released a statement that described its mission as creating opportunities “for the best female golfers in the world to showcase their talent” and said, “As a global tour and membership, we try not to let politics get in the way” of such opportunities. The organization added that the U. S. G. A. owns and operates the United States Women’s Open and “we respect and support the decisions made by the U. S. G. A. on this matter. ” The statement did not sit well with Thomas, who grew up in Los Angeles and played golf with her father at Rolling Hills Country Club and Riviera Country Club. Many of the courses she frequented were about as integrated as Trump’s cabinet, which has a smaller percentage of women and minorities than the first cabinets of his four immediate predecessors. “The ladies that play golf shouldn’t be forced to build up the Trump brand in any way,” she said. Judy Rankin, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, is discomfited by the notion that the players should allow politics to play through in the most prestigious women’s tournament in the United States. “Back in the dark ages, I did not agree with everything Gerald Ford did,” said Rankin, whose most successful season, 1976, coincided with Ford’s last full year as president. She won six tournaments that year and became the first L. P. G. A. player to surpass $100, 000 in yearly earnings. “I found him to be the most wonderful man, and I certainly played golf with him,” Rankin added. “Because you play golf with them does not necessarily mean you support every single thing they do. But they hold the highest office in the land. And I’m not sure that an invitation to play golf should be answered with a political statement. ”",0,1647,11.280821917808218,146,0.24833029751062538,0,0,0,0,94.79483621013675,16.3433211900425,72.80548471969237,82.34943097784628,0.8069216757741348,0.026108075288403157,0.04432301153612629,0.017607771706132362,0.04796599878567092,0.015179113539769277,0.2040072859744991,0.0024286581663630845,0.0018214936247723133,0.026108075288403157,0.10625379477838494,0.0012143290831815423,0.06132361870066788,0.004857316332726169,0.0018214936247723133,0.01092896174863388,0.006678809957498482,0.07650273224043716,0.0030358227079538553,0.05343047965998786,0.024286581663630843,0.048573163327261686,0,0,0.0230722525804493,0.012143290831815421,0.06800242865816636,0,0.0024286581663630845,0.0018214936247723133,0.023679417122040074,0,0.006678809957498482,0.04978749241044323,0,0,0.46994535519125685,0.0030358227079538553,0.012143290831815421,0.0006071645415907711,0.015179113539769277,0.03946569520340012,0.006071645415907711,0,0.01639344262295082,0.01092896174863388,0.04068002428658166,0.020643594414086218,0.0036429872495446266,0.010321797207043109,0.01153612629022465,0.007893139040680024,0.004250151791135397,0.0006071645415907711,0.03460837887067395,0.22586520947176686,0.0024286581663630845,0.0012143290831815423,0.023679417122040074,0.08682452944748027,0.07468123861566485,0.05950212507589557,0.03946569520340012,0.030358227079538554,0.14996964177292046,0.0989678202792957,0.020643594414086218,0.0018214936247723133,0.029143897996357013,0.13296903460837886,0.0006071645415907711,0.01700060716454159,0.0018214936247723133,0.0012143290831815423,0.009107468123861567,0,0,0.024286581663630843,0.10443230115361263,0.08561020036429873,0,0.015786278081360048,0.013964784456587736,0.03946569520340012,0.11475409836065574,0.12082574377656345,0.0018214936247723133,0.030965391621129327,0.004250151791135397,65.425,3,45.925,4.803125,24.1875,0,22,40.075,20.005000000000003,23.175,14,59.370000000000005,25.7975,0,65.425,0,201.89500000000004,26,108.178125,326.27,201.89500000000004,,0.5476635806151323,0.052597414302052746,0.45942446945414633,0.08163006133591794,0.30920609876132493,0,0.28933273217461164,0.4258223141958574,0.2701844010496214,0.3001475508092059,0.20577031601393264,0.5235125455693916,0.3231371416293962,0,0.28933273217461164,0,0.10841338796200338,0.013961455642844485,0.05808938821975331,0.1752001589458027,0.7103701433995748,0.8247998410541972,111
462,"56 Views November 14, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News As the bond market continues to melt down, interest rates rise and the Dollar Index surges above 100, legend Art Cashin gave one of his most important interviews ever to King World News about a Trump presidency, the New World Order, gold, Brexit, the Great Depression, and why we will see panic before the end of the year. Eric King: “In Trump’s acceptance speech he said that we are going to have massive infrastructure spending. Is that bearish for gold? I don’t think so.” Gold Market Hit As Druckenmiller Sells Art Cashin: “No. That on the face of it would not be a reason to sell gold. One of the things that may have concerned Druckenmiller was not so much your scenario of fiscal spending and building roads and highways, but the fact that despite what the Fed has been doing, the money supply has not been showing any velocity. That’s a topic you and I have discussed time and time again and it’s one of the holdups to gold because if it gets no velocity that’s deflationary. In fact, the largest growth in money stock is in cash — green pictures of dead presidents — and that is deflationary because that does not have a lending factor that money in a bank would have. So those are two deflationary trends in money and that tends to weigh a little bit on gold and doesn’t allow it to fulfill its promise that you would expect in a somewhat inflationary period.” Eric King: “Victor Sperandeo, a former associate of George Sorors, said to me this will be ‘pure money printing.’ That we are going to print trillions of dollars and build infrastructure — talk about how you view that. Obviously there are going to be jobs created and it will be great for infrastructure, so it will juice the economy, but what are the longer-term ramifications?” Art Cashin: “On the face of it, it looks good. As you said, there will be jobs created and there will be improvements in roads and airports and so on. However, the other shoe to fall is that Mr. Trump is also committed to revamping the tax code. And those two things should lead to a massive increase in the deficit. And we are already deeply in debt, so people like Rosenberg and others feel like it will have virtually no impact. On the face of it the stimulus program should be great for the economy, but because you are in such a high level of debt it might not work out that way. He and others point out that if fiscal stimulus were the answer then Japan would be the king of the world with all of those bridges to nowhere that they built. Japan spent a lot of money, built up their deficit, and their economy never really turned around.” Eric King: “Going back even further than that and looking at the Great Depression, the United States was struggling and then FDR devalued the dollar by revaluing the price of gold higher. Those public works projects then got underway, the massive public works projects that built so much of the infrastructure here in the United States, Art. And that did turn the stock market around. It turned many things around — commodities, etc — but then it rolled over by 1937-1938 and then the war came. Is this infrastructure spending program something that can look good for a little while and then it will just roll over like we saw in 1937-1938?” Art Cashin: “It can. And the problem (during the Great Depression) was that the thing didn’t click, as it were. It didn’t lead to the next step. You hire people, you do the road projects, you do whatever, and then you want to see them go out and spend and business begin to borrow and banks to lend. And in ’37 and ’38 that never fully kicked in. U.S. Experiences Second Stock Market Collapse From 1937 To 1938 You had high government officials, in frustration, go to Congress and testify: “We couldn’t get it started. We just couldn’t get it started.” For all of the deficit spending, for all of the government programs, it never fully worked. That’s the fear. Again, if you go back to Japan, clearly they spent trillions of Japanese yen in massive building projects and it never kicked in, it never took over. The people continued to worry and hold onto their money. A Worried Public Is Hoarding Cash As I’ve told you before, this whole thing about helicopter money and whatnot, if Bernanke flew over your house and dropped a million dollars in brand new money, and you were so worried that you got up and hid it in the garage until you figured out what the economy was going to do…And that is virtually what has happened to us for the past seven years. They have tried all kinds of increases in money supply but it has never kicked in and people are so terrified that they are not spending, and basically, as I said, the large amount of growth was in cash. So they are putting it in the mattress, not even in the bank.” Eric King: “Art, for so many years on King World News you have been talking about this lending and spending not kicking in, and you have used that Bernanke analogy over and over again. It’s not normal for you to beat up on a point as much as you have. But earlier you brought up Japan, and then when we covered the Great Depression you discussed 1937-1938, and the the testimonies before Congress from people saying, ‘We just couldn’t get it started.’ Did you know all along that it was going to unfold this way to some degree with the lack of lending and spending? Did you know that from history?” Art Cashin: “I had a fear of it and it became pretty evident after some of the first things they (central planners) did. It is not a very difficult game. Every week the Federal Reserve reports the Money Supply and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis reports the Monetary Stock, which is the amount of raw money that the Fed adds in. “We Just Couldn’t Get It Started” – Monetary Stock Plunging “That Shouldn’t Be” For a year now, despite all the things you have heard, despite all the programs and ‘pump-priming’ and Yellen and all the doves, the Monetary Stock has not increased all year. That shouldn’t be. 60-Year Velocity Of Money Stock Hitting New Lows If money has velocity, then you can see the economy begin to move up. If it gets too much velocity, then you get to see inflation. But so far we are not getting a high dose of either. Although, if you ask somebody standing in the supermarket if they have inflation they might give you a bit of an argument. But by government standards it’s not quite there yet.” Eric King: “Along those same lines, Art, you’ve warned repeatedly about Weimar Germany and the experience of the 1920s. This idea that there can be no inflation and then suddenly it just kicks in and then all hell breaks loose. You’ve warned so many time about that. Is that what’s in front of us?” Art Cashin: “You will begin to know it. Everybody talks about the Weimar Republic where they actually printed cash money and flooded the system. It wasn’t just the bank reserves — they actually flooded the system with paper money. And amazingly, amazingly, it was a while before that actually kicked in in an inflationary manner. And as you alluded to, I’ve said this time and time again, it’s one of those things like spontaneous combustion — it’s there and it’s there and it’s there and suddenly it bursts into flames. And when it bursts into flames it consumes everything about it. And that’s when you can have a runaway inflation. But so far it has not burst into flames. And that is why to even some degree the Fed is frustrated, hoping to get inflation up above 2 percent. And they may be in a position where, be careful what you wish for. Because if they get 2 percent and above it could suddenly combust and things could begin to move rather rapidly.” Eric King: “Art, let me ask you this about the Trump presidency. It seems like for those people out there who, as he said, felt lost, the lost Americans, and for those out there who really felt like they were having globalism shoved down their throats in Europe and in the United States, this seemed to be a moment in time where there was going to be some backtracking. The borders were going to be closed, there would be some protectionism — we all know the plusses and minuses of that — but how did you view this Trump election and him becoming president, the idea that the elite got sand kicked in their face and that this New World Order would be slowed down, if only for a moment?” Donald Trump’s Shocker And Why Brexit Is Nowhere Near Over Art Cashin: “I view it as yet one more extension of what looks to be a populist revolt that is sweeping the world. You saw the beginning of it with Brexit, and you have too many pundits on TV saying, ‘Well, that ended quickly in reverse.’ Brexit is nowhere near over. But the reason that markets didn’t continue to spiral (downward) is that they realized that Brexit has basically been postponed. They haven’t gone in and declared Article 50. Once they start the process in motion, the consequences of Brexit are going to be there and they are going to be drastic. Now, if you take Trump’s election as the second leg of populism, the next thing you look for is the December 4th referendum in Italy. And there’s a good chance that will cause the government to fail and Italy will be right back in the middle of a major European crisis, and we’ll be right back where we were with Greece (only much larger in scale). So this game is far from over and we could see further panic as we head into the end of the year.” Eric King: “Ahead of what’s going to happen in Italy, because I think that will unfold as you just predicted, Art, a Trump America going forward and this idea that the elites have been pushing globalism down everybody’s throats with NAFTA and so many things that have happened around the world. The globalism and the push to eliminate national boundaries, we’ve seen that in Europe and of course they had talked about combining Canada, the United States and Mexico into one regional unit. This idea that globalism has taken a huge blow here, is that true? Or did it just slow it down? What will a Trump presidency mean in that sense?” “You’re Fired!” Art Cashin: “We’ve got a lot of things to see. Over the next week or two you are going to see whom he appoints to the cabinet and who holds him under their sway. It would appear, however, because of the size of his commitment, he’s got to address globalization and global trade. He’s got to go back and revisit even NAFTA. I think some of his early attempts will be reasonably good. He will do some fiscal stimulus, some building and repairing, hopefully getting the tax structure in better order. But that will not be the end of it. He can pivot a bit but he can’t completely abandon it (his campaign promises). People will have to watch what he does. Now, he may cleverly hire some people and put burdens on their shoulders. If after six months things don’t work out, he can revert to his TV personality and say, ‘You’re fired,’ to show the American people that he’s staying on top.

463,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Polk County, FL Sheriff Grady Judd stated that illegal immigrants committing felonies is a phenomenon that is at an epidemic level “across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. ”  Judd was asked about his prior comments that illegal immigrants committing felonies are an “epidemic. ” He said, “It is at that level across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. And they’re committing felonies, violent felonies, and they’re trafficking in narcotics. And if that’s not enough, we deport them, they come back, and pick up doing the same thing again. ” He added, “We’re seeing a total[ly] different attitude by Immigration and Customs already. And what we have to do is pick them up, keep them locked up until they’re deported to their home country of origin. And I can tell you this, the community will be safer, less drugs will flow on our streets, and there will be less weapons violence. Every day my detectives go out, and they seek out and arrest people for violating the drug laws. Many of those folks are illegal aliens, here, with guns, posing a specific danger to our deputies, to our law enforcement officers, and to the community. But I have a simple question for those who think there’s a problem with that: Why don’t you take them home with you? Why don’t you rent them a home next door to you? Because you know they’re living next door to somebody in our community, and they’re terrorizing them. ” Judd also stated that he didn’t think what he proposed would result in economic losses, and “The people we arrest, they’re not harvesting any vegetables, or any citrus. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,354,20.823529411764707,17,0.2655367231638418,0,0,0,0,55.74127522195319,19.403745553463068,90.77429857320693,5.069993722536095,0.8220338983050848,0.002824858757062147,0.02824858757062147,0.03954802259887006,0.025423728813559324,0.03954802259887006,0.20903954802259886,0.00847457627118644,0.002824858757062147,0.05367231638418079,0.062146892655367235,0,0.09887005649717515,0.01694915254237288,0,0.01977401129943503,0.022598870056497175,0.09887005649717515,0.002824858757062147,0.06497175141242938,0.014124293785310734,0.05367231638418079,0,0.005649717514124294,0.025423728813559324,0.00847457627118644,0.07627118644067797,0,0.002824858757062147,0,0,0,0.00847457627118644,0.01977401129943503,0,0,0.5225988700564972,0.014124293785310734,0.002824858757062147,0.01694915254237288,0.00847457627118644,0.062146892655367235,0.002824858757062147,0.002824858757062147,0.011299435028248588,0.014124293785310734,0.005649717514124294,0.014124293785310734,0.005649717514124294,0.01694915254237288,0.025423728813559324,0.022598870056497175,0.002824858757062147,0,0,0.2175141242937853,0.00847457627118644,0,0.00847457627118644,0.03954802259887006,0.03672316384180791,0.09322033898305085,0.002824858757062147,0.01977401129943503,0.12146892655367232,0.1553672316384181,0.03389830508474576,0.005649717514124294,0.03389830508474576,0.13559322033898305,0,0.005649717514124294,0.011299435028248588,0.002824858757062147,0.002824858757062147,0,0,0.014124293785310734,0.14689265536723164,0.08757062146892655,0,0.022598870056497175,0.025423728813559324,0.031073446327683617,0.1497175141242938,0.14689265536723164,0.02824858757062147,0.00847457627118644,0.01694915254237288,6,0,82.9,0,0.6,0,0,20,1,65.9,9.3,0,18,0,6,0,19.6,0,118.9,134.5,19.6,,0.2455083338405087,0,0.8180456414984424,0,0.031514113027769,0,0,0.5203036951380752,0.05144274016101998,0.7813695979896117,0.3352669595110556,0,0.49397502890899647,0,0.17826035697019474,0,0.042655059847660506,0,0.258759521218716,0.2927094668117519,-0.8839363543357203,0.7072905331882481,29
464,"President Donald Trump reacted to the massive rioting at   in response to a scheduled campus speech by Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos. [“If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view  —   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” Trump wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.  News of the rioting made cable news last night as students smashed ATMs and bank windows, looted a Starbucks, beat Trump supporters, pepper sprayed innocent individuals, and set fires in the street. Others spray painted the words “Kill Trump” on storefronts. The speech was canceled by   police as security failed. Yiannopoulos was evacuated from the area. “The left is profoundly antithetical to free speech these days, does not want to hear alternative points of view, and will do anything to shut it down,” Yiannopoulos told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview on Wednesday night. “My point is being proven over and over and over again. ”    ",0,160,13.333333333333334,12,0.35625,0,0,0,0,97.09950454170108,55.79333333333334,42.55769230769231,61.32692307692307,0.75,0.01875,0.05,0.00625,0.05625,0.00625,0.175,0.00625,0,0,0.06875,0,0.05625,0,0,0.025,0.00625,0.08125,0,0.04375,0.01875,0.05625,0,0.00625,0.0375,0.0125,0.0875,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.0375,0,0,0.39375,0,0.03125,0.00625,0.00625,0.025,0.0125,0,0.00625,0,0.00625,0,0.03125,0,0.01875,0.01875,0.0125,0,0,0.15,0.0125,0,0.04375,0.0625,0.1125,0.0125,0.0375,0.06875,0.1625,0.0375,0,0.00625,0.05,0.18125,0,0,0.0125,0.00625,0.0125,0,0,0,0.0375,0.11875,0,0.0125,0,0.0625,0.09375,0.10625,0,0.06875,0.00625,2,0,20,2,0,0,0,6.83,0,0,12.175,0,3,0,2,0,15.175,0,36.83,50.004999999999995,15.175,,0.11433841851550565,0,0.5635083268962916,0.11433841851550565,0,0,0,0.3059770801323945,0,0,0.440055998641172,0,0.16223290110168398,0,0.36746792744318874,0,0.07781851747391093,0,0.18886695212943258,0.2564293223250686,-0.6640712810626801,0.7435706776749313,15
465,"Bill Herz, the last surviving crew member of Orson Welles’s mock “War of the Worlds” newscast, which terrified American radio listeners in 1938 with vivid bulletins warning Newark residents to evacuate as invading Martians incinerated central New Jersey, died on May 10 in Manhattan. He was 99. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Bill Kux, a cousin. Mr. Herz, who worked on other radio and theater productions as stage manager and casting director for Welles’s Mercury Theater company, staked one additional claim to fame. Until about six months ago, he had been a regular customer at Sardi’s restaurant, the   gathering place for celebrities and   tourists in the theater district, for some 82 years  —   beginning in 1933, just six years after it opened. That longevity alone distinguished him as a bon vivant in a shrinking cadre of original Broadway personalties. But he was also singled out periodically in the wider world as a relic of a bygone era, when a bogus radio news broadcast could provoke panic as war was brewing in Europe  —   however much that hysteria may have been overstated then and since. Welles’s CBS show “The Mercury Theater on the Air” presented an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel “The War of the Worlds” for its Halloween episode on Sunday, Oct. 30, 1938. The live hourlong program began with an updated prelude to the original novel eerily warning that superintelligent beings had been coveting “this Earth with envious eyes. ” Then music, a weather report and other regular features were interrupted by simulated news bulletins and fake feeds from   operators in the field. Mr. Herz, playing Operators Three and Five, took part in this exchange: Operator Three: This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     Warning! Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes. Reaches South Street. Gas masks useless. Urge population to move into open spaces.   …     Automobiles use Routes 7, 23, 24.   …     Avoid congested areas. Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.   …     Operator Four: 2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling 8X3R   …     Come in, please.   …     Operator Five: This is 8X3R   …     coming back at 2X2L. Operator Four: How’s reception? How’s reception? K, please. (Pause.) Where are you, 8X3R? What’s the matter? Where are you? John Houseman, Welles’s producer, wrote in his 1972 memoir, “ ”: “Our actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than 40 minutes. During that time men traveled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted it  —   emotionally if not logically. ” (Mr. Houseman went on to a distinguished career in theater and Hollywood.) Mr. Herz also read Welles’s part, that of a Professor Pierson at a New Jersey observatory, during rehearsals. He said he was surprised by the public’s response to the radio show. “During the broadcast, outside, policemen were coming,” he told CBS News in 2013. “They were told on the radio that the Martians were coming, the Martians were coming!” (Later scholarship about the incident suggested that the broadcast provoked far less fear among the public than has been popularly portrayed.) In a 2010 profile in The New York Times, Mr. Herz was quoted as saying: “I had done Orson’s part in the dress rehearsal, and after I did it, I thought to myself, ‘Nobody’s going to believe this in a million years.’ Boy, was I wrong. ” William Herz Jr. was born in Detroit on Aug. 2, 1916, the son of Harold William Herz, a girdle salesman, and the former Fannie Lichtig. (Bill Herz called himself Jr. even though he wasn’t one.) He graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh before moving to New York. He was briefly married to Susanne Guettel, whose brother Henry was a producer and film executive. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Herz had met Welles in Pittsburgh, where Welles, a young director at the time, had stopped while touring with a production of “Romeo and Juliet. ” They discovered that they had a common acquaintance in the actress Edith Meiser, a friend of Mr. Herz’s parents. Mr. Herz started working for Welles as a gofer. He later moved into Welles’s Manhattan home  —   Mr. Herz had been living with an aunt in Brooklyn  —   so that he could constantly be on call. They worked together on “Julius Caesar,” “The Cradle Will Rock” and “Too Much Johnson. ” Mr. Herz joined the Army Air Forces during World War II, managed a summer theater in Connecticut and produced and managed several plays in New York (including a few flops, one inauspiciously titled “The Strangler Fig”). After one failure, Vincent Sardi Sr. the founder of Sardi’s, generously invited him to keep an open tab in good times and bad. Another advantage to eating there was that Mackey’s Ticket Agency next door, where Mr. Herz later worked, had no restroom. Ivan Lesica, Sardi’s maître d’hôtel, said on Thursday that Mr. Herz would eat there once or twice a week and sit at Table Four, to the left of the dining room entrance, under his caricature. He would have coffee delivered in his own white mug, and typically order the chicken potpie or, appropriately enough for an habitué whom his cousin described as a confirmed curmudgeon, the crab meat sandwich.",0,909,15.40677966101695,59,0.33003300330033003,0,0,0,0,94.04768889587372,31.105977264393097,75.25213146314631,8.623882700770077,0.7667766776677668,0.011001100110011002,0.0517051705170517,0.027502750275027504,0.03850385038503851,0.0176017601760176,0.24202420242024203,0.0121012101210121,0.0044004400440044,0.022002200220022004,0.07920792079207921,0.0011001100110011,0.05720572057205721,0.0242024202420242,0.0022002200220022,0.015401540154015401,0,0.0462046204620462,0.007700770077007701,0.07260726072607261,0.0231023102310231,0.0484048404840484,0,0.005500550055005501,0.015401540154015401,0.005500550055005501,0.0781078107810781,0.0022002200220022,0.0088008800880088,0,0.0011001100110011,0,0.011001100110011002,0.0704070407040704,0.0033003300330033004,0.0033003300330033004,0.39603960396039606,0.011001100110011002,0.0121012101210121,0.005500550055005501,0.005500550055005501,0.033003300330033,0.0011001100110011,0.011001100110011002,0.006600660066006601,0.013201320132013201,0.028602860286028604,0.03850385038503851,0.006600660066006601,0.015401540154015401,0.005500550055005501,0.026402640264026403,0.0011001100110011,0,0.045104510451045104,0.23432343234323433,0.005500550055005501,0.006600660066006601,0.0187018701870187,0.08800880088008801,0.0858085808580858,0.034103410341034104,0.0121012101210121,0.0407040704070407,0.1353135313531353,0.0671067106710671,0.0121012101210121,0.005500550055005501,0.0319031903190319,0.1793179317931793,0,0.0033003300330033004,0.0088008800880088,0.0033003300330033004,0.006600660066006601,0,0,0.020902090209020903,0.09130913091309131,0.09460946094609461,0,0.007700770077007701,0.0044004400440044,0.06930693069306931,0.10891089108910891,0.1188118811881188,0.0011001100110011,0.0429042904290429,0.0022002200220022,18,0,53.9,2.8,2,0,6,27,1.73,71.57999999999998,11,9,15,0,18,10,50.14,16,132.28,196.67000000000002,50.14,,0.34383213241055616,0,0.6107570653874922,0.07536783255611772,0.05501892529699887,0,0.14869472766417136,0.44008970735067426,0.04794750309417772,0.6757220592380292,0.2425518496893189,0.20760705429637674,0.30394442002045036,0,0.32046762588723626,0.22547340809847535,0.04772192981621251,0.015228378082556844,0.1259006157975387,0.18718531984352843,-0.7717754875086867,0.8128146801564715,55
466,"Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, drew a parallel on Wednesday between the Syrian government’s targeting of noncombatants in that nation’s civil war and the accidental bombing of civilians by United   forces. Attacking Hillary Clinton over what he criticized as her overly interventionist instincts, Mr. Johnson pointed to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians killed by forces loyal to President Bashar   as well as civilian deaths caused by the   coalition, and said Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, bore at least partial responsibility. But when pressed four times on whether he saw a moral equivalence between deaths caused by the United States, directly or indirectly, and mass killings of civilians by Mr. Assad and his allies, Mr. Johnson made clear that he did. “Well no, of course not  —   we’re so much better than all that,” Mr. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said sarcastically. “We’re so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital. ” The remarks by Mr. Johnson came in an interview with The New York Times after a string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs. After failing to recognize the   Syrian city of Aleppo during a television interview Sept. 8, Mr. Johnson had another difficult moment on Sept. 28, when he vainly tried to name a foreign leader whom he admired. In the Times interview on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson conspicuously sought to avoid another misstep. Asked if he knew the name of North Korea’s leader, Mr. Johnson replied, “I do. ” “You want me to name” the person, he said, then paused, before adding dryly, “Really. ” But he declined to supply the name. Mr. Johnson complained that Mrs. Clinton was being judged on her base of knowledge rather than her interventionist instincts. “Because Hillary Clinton can dot the i’s and cross the t’s on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders,” he said, “the underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside. ” He charged that Mrs. Clinton “bears responsibility for what’s happened, shared responsibility for what’s happened in Syria. I would not have put us in that situation from the  . ” More than 400, 000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, according to the United Nations. But Mr. Johnson complained that presidential candidates were expected to talk tough about dealing with dictators like Mr. Assad or risk losing support. “This is what happens in this country right now  —   unless you’re willing to say that you’re going to get tough on this stuff, on these atrocities  —   and these atrocities are horrible  —   but unless you as a politician are willing to do something about these atrocities then we’re not going to elect you,” Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson speculated about the deals or promises that the Obama administration may have dangled before   forces, but then said at other points that he was at a disadvantage discussing world events because he has not received the classified briefings that the Democratic and Republican nominees for president have been given. Mr. Johnson also declined to say whether his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, had warned him of his intention to change course and spend the remainder of the presidential campaign attacking Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, as unqualified. Mr. Weld revealed those plans in an interview with The Boston Globe on Tuesday. “That may be his primary mission,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Weld’s plans. “We’re not scripted at all. And so I guess my role will be Hillary and his role will be Donald Trump. ” But he insisted that Mr. Weld would not drop out at any point and endorse Mrs. Clinton. “Absolutely,” Mr. Johnson said when asked if Mr. Weld would fight on until Nov. 8. Mr. Johnson said that the idea of hunkering down and trying to make an aggressive play to win his home state of New Mexico, where polls show him in contention, had crossed his mind. But he conceded that his chances of winning outright were all but gone. “Right now it’s a Hail Mary, not being in the presidential debates,” he said.",0,713,20.970588235294116,34,0.3281907433380084,0,0,0,0,84.75192966387115,8.137294004207575,85.9987249776871,8.839651998597475,0.7854137447405329,0.019635343618513323,0.047685834502103785,0.029453015427769985,0.05890603085553997,0.015427769985974754,0.2061711079943899,0.016830294530154277,0.004207573632538569,0.021037868162692847,0.06451612903225806,0.001402524544179523,0.05750350631136045,0.002805049088359046,0,0.015427769985974754,0.011220196353436185,0.09537166900420757,0,0.05890603085553997,0.029453015427769985,0.07012622720897616,0,0.012622720897615708,0.04207573632538569,0.011220196353436185,0.1150070126227209,0,0,0.001402524544179523,0.009817671809256662,0,0.016830294530154277,0.05329593267882188,0.001402524544179523,0.001402524544179523,0.4586255259467041,0.002805049088359046,0.0182328190743338,0.001402524544179523,0.008415147265077139,0.047685834502103785,0.004207573632538569,0,0.009817671809256662,0.0182328190743338,0.005610098176718092,0.06591865357643759,0.001402524544179523,0.015427769985974754,0.011220196353436185,0.033660589060308554,0,0.002805049088359046,0.015427769985974754,0.211781206171108,0.005610098176718092,0,0.02664796633941094,0.08415147265077139,0.05890603085553997,0.06451612903225806,0.019635343618513323,0.0785413744740533,0.15007012622720897,0.11220196353436185,0.015427769985974754,0,0.0364656381486676,0.11781206171107994,0.001402524544179523,0.011220196353436185,0.009817671809256662,0.002805049088359046,0.0070126227208976155,0,0,0.04067321178120617,0.15427769985974754,0.061711079943899017,0,0.0182328190743338,0,0.04207573632538569,0.12622720897615708,0.11921458625525946,0.008415147265077139,0.0364656381486676,0.0070126227208976155,9.5,0,113,13,2,4,7,29,11,58,4,11,21,3,9.5,3,48.5,13,167,221.5,48.5,,0.2670278785887252,0,0.8125006628214412,0.3326781312534985,0.07123316455861123,0.13299282904102766,0.2116286328774551,0.5265373974937438,0.29668140577623714,0.689845395675479,0.13299282904102766,0.29668140577623714,0.4460795064310565,0.10317500575623216,0.6572305049227859,0.10317500575623216,0.05539691604797259,0.014848657909765849,0.1907481439177613,0.2529982866933181,-0.8653482430711442,0.747001713306682,59
467,"On Thursday, Republican Senators Ted Cruz ( ) and Lindsey Graham ( ) introduced legislation that would defund the United Nations over the Security Council’s passage of UN Resolution 2334, which calls Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “illegal. ”[The “Safeguard Israel Act” states that the U. S. government will be prohibited from giving any money to the UN, or any of its affiliates, until President Barack Obama confirms the UN resolution has been repealed and can certify that he has done so. America provides the UN with 22 percent of its budget, contributing $8 billion to the largely   organization annually.  “United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 falsely claims that Israel’s sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and Jewish communities in the West Bank are illegal under international law, and that the Old City of Jerusalem, along with the Temple Mount, the holiest site for the Jewish people, and the Western Wall are ‘occupied Palestinian territory,’” the Safeguard Israel Act states. The  December 23   resolution 2334 passed nearly unanimously despite the Obama administration’s decision to break with tradition and abstain from voting instead of vetoing it. Because the United States is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, an American veto would have automatically stopped the resolution and prevented it from passing. “President Obama betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by permitting the passage of a biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally,” Sen. Cruz said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Thursday morning. “The Security Council’s resolution is only the latest example of the UN’s long history of obsessive hostility towards Israel. ” Sen. Graham said, “I begged the UN months before, don’t put me in this box. I think most Americans believe the United Nations has become more   more  . ” He added, “I’m a big internationalist, but we’re gonna stop the money until we get this fixed. ” The Safeguard Israel Act also notes that during his final address to the UNSC on December 16, outgoing UN   Ban   admitted UN bias against Israel when he stated, “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports, and conferences criticizing Israel. ” The legislation adds, the “United Nations passes more resolutions condemning Israel than any other country in the world. ” Last week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on a   vote objecting to the Security Council vote. Despite strong bipartisan support for the measure, at least 75 Democrats and four Republicans voted against it many of the opposing Democrats accused Republicans of introducing HR 11 to attack Obama unfairly in the last two weeks of his presidency. Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( ) Rep. David Price ( ) and Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) were among Democrats to vote against HR 11.

469,"Rose Evansky, a British hairdresser who liberated women from the prison of the   domed dryer when she invented   styling at her London salon in the early 1960s, died on Nov. 21. She was 94. Her death was reported only recently by the British news media. There was no information on where she died. Mrs. Evansky, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, set up as a hairstylist soon after World War II. She and her hairdresser husband, Albert, opened a small shop in Hendon, a London suburb, and did so well that, in 1954, they moved to Mayfair, where the city’s elite paid top money for    styling. One day in 1962, as she faced a tedious morning of chemical   and tight curling, tasks she disliked, inspiration struck. “I’d been wandering past a barbershop in Brook Street around the corner from our salon in North Audley Street, and I saw the barber drying the front of a man’s hair with a brush and a   dryer,” she told W magazine in 2012. “And this image  —   of the barber with the dryer  —   flashed through my mind and I thought, ‘Why not for women? ’” She experimented on one of her clients, a Mrs. Hay. “I picked up a spiky plastic hairbrush and a hand dryer and started rolling a wet section of her hair around the brush, followed by warm air from the hand dryer held in my left hand,” she wrote in a memoir, “In Paris We Sang” (2013). “The more sections of wet hair I rolled over the brush, the easier it became, and soon part of Mrs. Hay’s curly hair looked smooth, as if it had been brushed through from a set. Exciting!” One day by chance, Lady Clare Rendlesham, the editor of the British edition of Vogue, dropped by the salon and, witnessing a   in progress, stopped dead in her tracks. “What are you doing, Rose?” Mrs. Evansky recalled her shouting. Lady Clare immediately tipped off her friend Barbara Griggs, the fashion editor of The Evening Standard, who came in to behold the soft and flowing   style. That afternoon, the newspaper trumpeted the news of “the blow wave” to its readers. “This instantly earned her a reputation as one of the top hairdressers in London and went on to become the norm in hair drying,” Hairdressers Journal International wrote in 2012, celebrating the industry’s pioneers. Mrs. Evansky took quiet pride in getting women out from under the sizzling heat of the dome, and in the durability of her invention. “I always look at the prices of hairdressers now, and I say, my God, it’s still there: ‘’” she told an interviewer for the beauty brand Space NK in 2013. “How wonderful, 50 years later. ” She was born Rosel Lerner on May 30, 1922, in Worms, south of Frankfurt. Her parents were immigrants from Poland. In 1938, when the family was living in Ludwigshafen, her father was arrested and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Speaking only German and Yiddish, she was sent to Britain on one of the last Kindertransport trains that carried Jewish children out of Germany. She lived briefly with a family in Dudley, in the West Midlands, before moving to London, just in time for the Blitz. There, she apprenticed for a barber in Whitechapel, and distinguished herself with her zeal. “I worked and practiced till late at night on anyone who’d let me get at their hair,” she wrote in her memoir. As World War II raged, she embarked on her career, finding work at a salon near Regent Street. In 1943, she married Albert Evansky. When their marriage ended in divorce, her husband bought her share of the business. He sold it in the early 1980s. What Florence was to painting and sculpture during the Renaissance, Mayfair was to the art of hairstyling in the 1950s and ’60s. Mrs. Evansky sat atop the heap, the lone woman in a field monopolized by men. In “Vidal: The Autobiography,” Vidal Sassoon called her “without question the top female stylist in the country and the equal of any man. ” Her protégés included Leonard Lewis, known professionally as Leonard of Mayfair, who died on Nov. 30. Mrs. Evansky was in the forefront of the Mayfair style, which emphasized “freedom and movement, rather than contrived waves and curls,” Kim Smith of the University of East London wrote in her doctoral dissertation on West London hair salons. The Mayfair look led directly to the internationally celebrated styles associated with Swinging London and the likes of Jean Shrimpton, Julie Christie and Twiggy, who was a client of Mr. Lewis. In 1965, soon after leaving her husband, Mrs. Evansky married the playwright Denis Cannan, took his last name and moved with him to the countryside in East Sussex. He died in 2011. She is survived by two stepsons, Alexander and Nicholas Cannan a stepdaughter, Crescy Cannan and two  . Her own hair was naturally  . “My hair is best described as ‘windswept,’ as I live near the sea,” she told W magazine. “I’ve never colored it, and I cut it myself. Why would I let anyone else when I can do it myself?”",0,864,18.782608695652176,46,0.2824074074074074,0,0,0,0,95.39220824598183,21.19462599854756,81.35685685685687,35.901920438957475,0.7696759259259259,0.016203703703703703,0.03819444444444445,0.032407407407407406,0.02199074074074074,0.017361111111111112,0.21180555555555555,0.003472222222222222,0,0.013888888888888888,0.09490740740740741,0,0.037037037037037035,0.008101851851851851,0.003472222222222222,0.005787037037037037,0.003472222222222222,0.03587962962962963,0.0023148148148148147,0.08564814814814815,0.024305555555555556,0.05324074074074074,0,0.009259259259259259,0.008101851851851851,0.003472222222222222,0.06365740740740741,0.0011574074074074073,0.013888888888888888,0.015046296296296295,0.06712962962962964,0,0.004629629629629629,0.07175925925925926,0.0011574074074074073,0.0011574074074074073,0.47453703703703703,0.004629629629629629,0.005787037037037037,0.0023148148148148147,0.023148148148148147,0.02662037037037037,0.0011574074074074073,0,0.011574074074074073,0.019675925925925927,0.011574074074074073,0.013888888888888888,0.010416666666666666,0.018518518518518517,0.004629629629629629,0.008101851851851851,0,0.0011574074074074073,0.03125,0.1909722222222222,0.0023148148148148147,0.0011574074074074073,0.028935185185185185,0.061342592592592594,0.061342592592592594,0.08333333333333333,0.013888888888888888,0.03125,0.16898148148148148,0.1099537037037037,0.005787037037037037,0.003472222222222222,0.04050925925925926,0.17592592592592593,0.004629629629629629,0.008101851851851851,0.0011574074074074073,0.0011574074074074073,0.008101851851851851,0,0,0.05324074074074074,0.12152777777777778,0.11226851851851852,0,0.008101851851851851,0.003472222222222222,0.046296296296296294,0.09606481481481481,0.09953703703703703,0.0023148148148148147,0.028935185185185185,0.0011574074074074073,27,0,61,10,5,4,0,18,14.73,58,8,20,13,0,27,1,77.73,4,94,174.73000000000002,77.73,,0.4709452772647511,0,0.6678966053735885,0.24794514361227077,0.141516769699476,0.11651106980622213,0,0.3724279059928048,0.32688657544427147,0.6566173882897055,0.20870562407669346,0.3973654529310078,0.30001268054684505,0,0.5625148597802963,0.031916759277699894,0.07798501098592397,0.004013122911921985,0.09430838843016665,0.17530324160003213,-0.4313634863317024,0.8246967583999678,42

472,"Saturated Fat and Heart Disease: “The Greatest Scam in the History of Medicine” by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Dr. Malcom Kendrick is a Scottish doctor and author of the book The Great Cholesterol Con . Recently he wrote a blog post on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease. He commented on how the science actually proves the opposite conclusion from what is commonly believed about saturated fats: To be honest, I have studied saturated fat consumption many, many… many, many, times. The one thing that has always stood out, most starkly, is the complete lack of any real evidence to support the idea that it causes cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, evidence contradicting it arrives on an almost daily basis. Kendrick goes on to quote from a recently published study which showed, in Kendrick’s words: The more saturated fat you eat, the lower your risk of dying of cardiovascular disease, and vice-versa. So why is this hypothesis about saturated fat and heart disease so entrenched in medical circles? Kendrick draws an interesting parallel between the recent attacks against Dr. Waney Squier and her exposure of the theory of “Shaken Baby Syndrome” as having no scientific merit. My thoughts were drawn to this issue by something seemingly unconnected. Which is a legal hearing in the UK concerning shaken baby syndrome. Most experts in paediatrics are absolutely convinced that there is such a thing. It is quoted in textbooks as an undisputed fact. Many parents, and other adults, have been convicted, and sent to jail, for shaking their babies so hard that it caused the ‘triad’ of shaken baby syndrome: subdural hematoma, retinal bleeding, and brain swelling On the other hand, we have Dr. Waney Squier, a paediatrician who used to provide expert opinion on child abuse cases in the UK. She was struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC) for, well the exact judgement is, as per Derrida, impossible to understand. Leaving the machinations of the GMC aside, the main issue is simple. Dr. Waney Squier does not believe that shaken baby syndrome exists. Of course she knows that the triad of subdural haematoma, retinal bleeding and brain swelling exists. But she believes there could be other explanations. Including, perish the very thought, an accidental fall. Because she does not believe in shaken baby syndrome, she has presented evidence in court which has tended to undermine the prosecution case against parents and carers, accused of shaking a baby and causing severe brain damage. Much to the annoyance of the police, and they then, for it was indeed them, reported Dr. Squier to the GMC. Now, I know what most of you are thinking. Surely ‘shaken baby syndrome’ exists. This must have been proven. Well, it has not. If you think about it, how could it be proven? How do you think a study on shaken baby syndrome could ever be done? Get five hundred children, shake them forcefully and see what happens to their brains. I suspect you might find gaining ethical approval for a such a study might be tricky. Shaken Baby Syndrome: Saturated Fat Consumption Kendrick goes on to explain what he sees as the rationale in both scientific theories that seem to have very little evidence to support, and yet is widely held in medical circles. Regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome: On the fact of it shaken baby syndrome and saturated fat consumption have very little in common. However, from another perspective the parallels are clear. Both are seductively simple ideas that appeal to common sense. That most deadly of all senses. Most people can clearly see how a small, vulnerable, baby will suffer significant brain injury if it is shaken too hard. Close your eyes and you can virtually see it happening. If you can bear having that image in your head for any length of time. Most parents, I think, can almost see themselves doing it, or having done it – when their child will ‘just not dammed well stop crying.’ In short, shaken baby syndrome can easily be visualised, and it triggers a kind of visceral horror. We can easily see how a feckless parent may lack the self-control required to stop themselves doing it. ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up….’ And that, dear reader, is as scientific as shaken baby syndrome gets. A hypothesis based on visceral fear, prejudice, and knee-jerk judgement. This makes it almost perfectly resistant to any contradictory evidence. Try to argue against it, and you will meet anger and bluster and the idée fixe. Regarding Saturated Fats causing Heart Disease: The ‘saturated fat causing heart disease hypothesis’ comes from a very similar place called – well, it’s obvious isn’t it, just common sense. Heart disease is basically a build up of fat in the arteries, isn’t it? Where can that possibly come from? Fat in the diet. Especially the thick, sticky, gooey stuff that you get on a pork chop, or suchlike. That’s got to be it hasn’t it? The thick horrible squidgy gooey fat that you eat, ends up as thick horrible squidgy gooey fat in your arteries. Serves you right for eating fat, and McDonald’s, and suchlike. There rests the entire scientific argument against saturated fat. As such it is difficult to argue against. Facts simply bounce off. Comment on this article at CoconutOil.com.

473,"On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Wolf,” Senator Jeff Merkley ( ) stated that Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court is a “  scheme. ” And that if Gorsuch was principled, “he would have turned down this nomination, on the basis that the person who should be nominated is Merrick Garland. ”  Merkley said he would vote against Gorsuch because “I’m not going to be part of a   scheme. This seat, for the first time in US history, was stolen from one president and delivered to the next, with the hope of packing the court to the far right. And with Gorsuch, we’re talking to the very far right. ” Merkley further said that if Gorsuch was principled, “he would have turned down this nomination, on the basis that the person who should be nominated is Merrick Garland. ” He later added, “[I]f one doesn’t care about the integrity of the court, and you just want to look at this nominee from a judicial perspective, we have two other significant problems with him. The first is that the president’s team is under investigation for having potentially interfered in the US presidential election. If that turns out to be true, that is traitorous conduct. And that means that this conversation should be set aside until that is cleared up. And the second is, Gorsuch is way out of the mainstream. He hates class action lawsuits. He doesn’t want the LGBT community to be able to use the courts to end discrimination. He finds and twists a lot to find corporations  —   for corporations against ordinary citizens time after time after time. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,278,18.533333333333335,15,0.2733812949640288,0,0,0,0,86.11584521202913,6.423003369456334,74.1445811093061,52.776978417266186,0.8129496402877698,0.017985611510791366,0.02877697841726619,0.01079136690647482,0.02877697841726619,0.02877697841726619,0.1906474820143885,0.0035971223021582736,0,0.02877697841726619,0.08633093525179857,0,0.11151079136690648,0,0,0.014388489208633094,0.0035971223021582736,0.10071942446043165,0,0.050359712230215826,0.014388489208633094,0.04316546762589928,0,0,0.025179856115107913,0.046762589928057555,0.10431654676258993,0,0,0,0,0,0.01079136690647482,0.02877697841726619,0,0,0.5215827338129496,0,0.007194244604316547,0,0.007194244604316547,0.0683453237410072,0.0035971223021582736,0,0.014388489208633094,0.007194244604316547,0.007194244604316547,0.02877697841726619,0.0035971223021582736,0.02877697841726619,0.01079136690647482,0.007194244604316547,0.0035971223021582736,0,0.02158273381294964,0.2517985611510791,0.014388489208633094,0.0035971223021582736,0.01079136690647482,0.050359712230215826,0.03597122302158273,0.0539568345323741,0.02158273381294964,0.0539568345323741,0.15467625899280577,0.1223021582733813,0.01079136690647482,0,0.04316546762589928,0.1474820143884892,0,0.0035971223021582736,0.0035971223021582736,0,0.0035971223021582736,0,0,0.02877697841726619,0.08992805755395683,0.0683453237410072,0,0.02158273381294964,0,0.050359712230215826,0.15467625899280577,0.18345323741007194,0.014388489208633094,0.03237410071942446,0.0035971223021582736,3,0,17,0,2,0,9,11,0,11,0,0,6,0,3,0,11,9,32,52,11,,0.14763410387308012,0,0.49533066242810353,0,0.10351694645735657,0,0.34193868804200434,0.38841111079651675,0,0.38841111079651675,0,0,0.2572842744474721,0,0,0,0.03481012658227848,0.028481012658227847,0.10126582278481013,0.16455696202531644,-0.6316274123978224,0.8354430379746836,14
474,"Lisa Tanner October 31, 2016 Four Common Mistakes When Burning Wood Do you heat your house with wood heat? Wood stoves are a great way to provide heat even when the power goes out. They help lower your heat bill . But, burning wood takes a little preparation. You need to make sure your stove is ready to burn safely throughout the winter months. You’ll have to put up a supply of firewood to see you through the season. Here are some major mistakes people make when burning wood, and how you can avoid them. 1. Not Inspecting & Cleaning Your Stove Before you start burning around the clock, make sure your stove and chimney are ready for the season. As part of this inspection, you’ll want to examine your firebrick lining and see if any of it needs replaced. The brick reflects heat, keeping the body of the stove from overheating. You’ll also want to make sure the chimney is cleaned. You can either get it cleaned professionally, or do it yourself, whichever you are most comfortable with. This will prevent chimney fires, and help your fire burn more efficiently. If any of your stovepipe leading to the chimney has a sharp turn, you’ll want to give that section extra attention during cleaning. Creosote can build up quickly in a bend. When your stove is cool, disconnect the pipe if you can and take it outside to ensure its thoroughly cleaned. While you’re checking your stove, be sure to check the seal around the door. You want a tight seal to keep smoke from getting into your house. The braid cord that’s around the door in many stove models may occasionally need replaced. Once everything is in good working order, you’ll be all set to use your stove all winter long. Neglecting these steps can lead to a chimney or house fire. 2. Not Having Enough Wood You don’t want to run out of wood in the middle of winter. It’s always best to have too much wood on hand rather than too little. How much you’ll need depends on many factors, such as: Whether your family is home all day How large your house is How much insulation your house has How low the temperatures drop in your area The type of wood you’ll be burning How hot you like your fires How much of the year you’ll burn I live in a large, old home without much insulation in the rooms we haven’t yet renovated. Most windows are still single-paned. And the kids and I are home all day long. We burn a lot more wood than my parents who live across the street. Their home is insulated well, has updated windows, and they work out of the house so they just bank their fire before they leave. Ten cord of wood is what we try to have on hand at the start of winter. We don’t typically burn it all, but if the temperatures drop below zero, we go through wood at an alarming rate. We also don’t just burn in the “winter” months. To keep the house comfortable, we usually burn September through May. It’s a lot of wood, but I’d much rather end the burning season with a head start on next winter’s supply than be caught short. We did that once when we first moved here, and falling dead trees with three feet of snow on the ground in the freezing weather wasn’t fun. When you make your estimate for firewood usage, estimate high, especially if it’s your first year. You’ll be able to get a better idea of how much wood you used in the spring. That’ll make future estimates easier. 3. Not Storing Your Wood Properly Once you have your firewood cut, it’s time to split it and stack it . You want to make sure it’s not going to get wet over the winter, so store it somewhere dry. It’s best to store your wood off the ground a bit, like on a pallet. That way the air can circulate throughout the pile and keep everything dry. You can stack your wood in a woodshed, an old barn, a lean-to, or pallets in the yard with a tarp on top. You’ll want to ensure a couple sides of your woodpile are opened to allow air to circulate. Since wood is flammable and can attract pests, it’s best not to store large quantities of it touching your house or in your basement. Properly storing your firewood will help protect your supply . That way you always have seasoned wood ready to go when you need it. If you don’t take care of your woodpile, it’ll get exposed to the elements and won’t dry out. 4. Not Having a Backup Plan What would happen if your wood supply gets stolen or compromised? What if you underestimated how much you’d need and now you’re out? If you need to heat your home and you’re out of wood, there are some alternatives to burn in your stove. Some will burn quickly, while others will smolder for quite a while. You should think through a worst-case scenario before winter hits, and examine some of your options. Rolled Jean Logs Do you have old jeans that no longer fit or are so full of holes you can’t wear them? You can roll each pair into a tight log, tie it with string or twine, and then let it burn. The tighter you roll it, the longer it’ll take to burn. That’s because you’re keeping the air from circulating through it as quickly. To make a jean roll, you’ll need a pair of jeans and a couple of feet of string. Here’s the way I found to be the easiest. Stretch the jeans out in front of you, with the legs closest to your body. Begin rolling one leg. Roll it as tight as you can, jellyroll style. Once you get to the crotch, take a section of string and tie it around the rolled leg to keep it in place. You’ll want the string to run across the long end of the roll rather than the short end. Now, repeat with the other leg. When both legs are secure, grab onto both sections. Slowly begin rolling the leg rolls up into the waist of the pants. It’ll be bulky, so you’ll have to keep pressure on it to keep it tight. The waist section should completely cover the individual leg rolls and wrap around it a couple of times. Once you’ve reached the top of the jeans, it’s best if you have some help to tie it. That way you can ensure it stays tightly wound. Wrap string all the way around it and secure tightly. Repeat in three more places. Now your jean logs are ready for the fireplace. Rolled Paper Logs Do you have a large supply of newspapers on hand? What about books, magazines, or a couple of phone books? This paper can all be used to create rolled paper logs to burn. You’ll need to stack up your paper before you roll it. You want your finished log to be about three inches in diameter, so you might need to experiment with how much you stack to see how thick your finished product turns out. As with the jeans, you’ll want to roll the paper as tightly as possible. It’ll take a while to get the first couple of logs rolled, but once you get the hang of it, the process will go more quickly. Once the paper is rolled, use string, twine, or rubber bands to hold it tightly. You don’t want it to unroll on you. Video first seen on New and Lost Crafts . Green Wood If you have access to green wood, you can cut it down and it’ll burn. Are there any shrubs, bushes, or trees in your yard that you could get to safely? When going this route, keep in mind that green wood burns differently than seasoned wood. It’s harder to start, and may require a propane torch instead of just a match. Unseasoned wood also puts more creosote into your chimney, so you’ll want to ensure you check the chimney frequently for any build up. If you notice build up, let your fire go out and clean the chimney before you use it again. You don’t want to start a chimney fire! An Emergency Tree We usually pick out one or two emergency trees at the start of each fire burning season. These are standing dead trees on the property that’ll be accessible by tractor even in the middle of winter. If our wood supply is ever compromised, we know that we can get a couple loads from those trees. If you have your own wooded land, you might consider leaving an emergency tree too. Twisted Straw Sticks You can take a page out of a Little House book and use the method Laura and Pa did in The Long Winter. When the Ingalls family ran out of wood to burn, they started twisting hay into long sticks. It was time consuming, but kept the family warm through the long winter. If you have a surplus of hay or straw, you can make your own sticks to burn. You’ll want to ensure the sticks are tightly wound so they burn longer. Broken Furniture and Wood Scraps Do you have any broken wood furniture around your homestead? How about wood scraps from building projects? Both can be burned. What other wood burning mistakes can you add? These are four common mistakes that people burning with wood make. Can you add others to the list? How do you best prepare for your wood burning season?

475,"Now that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers’ online data. States have other ideas. As on climate change, immigration and a host of other issues, some state legislatures may prove to be a counterweight to Washington by enacting new regulations to increase consumers’ privacy rights. Illinois legislators are considering a “right to know” bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates. Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers’ locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in   devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois  —   because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of   and   features to localize their effects. Congress is pushing to overturn regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration that limit the collection of data by broadband providers like ATT and Comcast. The Senate approved the rollback last week, and the House is expected to follow this week. Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation. Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction. California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees’ social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants. “More and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,” said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and   Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said. States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle. In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them. But federal blockage can create local opportunities. “What you’re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts  —   not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s consumer protection bureau. “So what’s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it’s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy. ” In Illinois, the “right to know” legislation recently cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, paving the way for a full vote sometime in the next few weeks. Technology companies and their trade organizations are lobbying fiercely against it. “I think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,” said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure. Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation. In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers. “Hiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service  —   that will be a real burden for small businesses,” he said. Illinois also has another dimension:   lawyers. Almost a decade ago the state passed a trailblazing law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, that regulates the collection of things like facial scans, voice data and thumbprints. This has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against Facebook, Google and others. Last year, lobbyists for Facebook failed in a push for an amendment that would have weakened the biometric law by exempting   technologies that are now commonly used on social media. In the interim, however, lawyers at Edelson PC, a     firm that has become notorious among tech companies for its prolific filing of privacy suits, have gone on offense with a lobbying campaign of their own. Firm lawyers have also helped found a new nonprofit group, the Digital Privacy Alliance, as an advocate for privacy legislation in Illinois and elsewhere. “We were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,” said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. “It’s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general. ”",0,1023,24.951219512195124,41,0.37927663734115347,0,0,0,0,89.58239199705476,16.8886119257087,64.49838890699105,37.89374027008435,0.7761485826001955,0.020527859237536656,0.03421309872922776,0.03519061583577713,0.03128054740957967,0.019550342130987292,0.14076246334310852,0.0039100684261974585,0.0009775171065493646,0.009775171065493646,0.07624633431085044,0,0.07038123167155426,0.007820136852394917,0.004887585532746823,0.01857282502443793,0.0019550342130987292,0.07820136852394917,0.0009775171065493646,0.06842619745845552,0.021505376344086023,0.06256109481915934,0,0,0.022482893450635387,0.01270772238514174,0.11436950146627566,0,0.0009775171065493646,0.0009775171065493646,0,0.0009775171065493646,0.011730205278592375,0.03225806451612903,0.0009775171065493646,0.0009775171065493646,0.44086021505376344,0.0009775171065493646,0.010752688172043012,0.0039100684261974585,0.002932551319648094,0.04985337243401759,0.0019550342130987292,0,0.013685239491691105,0.011730205278592375,0.004887585532746823,0.0039100684261974585,0.02346041055718475,0.02541544477028348,0.004887585532746823,0.010752688172043012,0,0.0009775171065493646,0.006842619745845552,0.20527859237536658,0.002932551319648094,0,0.017595307917888565,0.04105571847507331,0.11143695014662756,0.02541544477028348,0.017595307917888565,0.06744868035190615,0.13880742913000976,0.07526881720430108,0.021505376344086023,0,0.017595307917888565,0.12805474095796676,0,0.009775171065493646,0.004887585532746823,0.0019550342130987292,0.005865102639296188,0,0.0019550342130987292,0.0019550342130987292,0.06451612903225806,0.06940371456500488,0,0.016617790811339198,0.017595307917888565,0.03714565004887586,0.11632453567937438,0.12805474095796676,0.0019550342130987292,0.09481915933528837,0.0009775171065493646,17.5,0,32,8,5,6,0,12,16.5,17,14.5,15,23,0,17.5,0,67.75,8,87,160.75,67.75,,0.37931627681688046,0,0.5277424115211441,0.21836658334976405,0.14865183727391637,0.17323195505014824,0,0.2953072566843675,0.36556475598013627,0.37251584962598117,0.3361489312587359,0.34375568386267324,0.445428759143341,0,0.5198233622472773,0,0.0600753713145644,0.007093770782531589,0.07714475726003103,0.14254045666149412,-0.4873608133843245,0.8574595433385059,56

477,"WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt on Friday to run the Environmental Protection Agency, putting a seasoned legal opponent of the agency at the helm of President Trump’s efforts to dismantle major regulations on climate change and clean water  —   and to cut the size and authority of the government’s environmental enforcer. Senators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E. P. A. ’s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency’s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from   states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him. Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general’s office is under order to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep. Democrats, environmental groups and even current E. P. A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt’s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate. Both opponents and supporters of Mr. Pruitt’s say he is well positioned to carry out Mr. Trump’s campaign trail promises to dismantle the agency and slash its ranks of employees. Mr. Trump vowed to “get rid” of the agency “in almost every form. ” A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors. Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E. P. A. regulations. Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships. “I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them  —   and shame on us if we didn’t,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. “Mr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a   and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E. P. A. ,” Mr. Carper said. “Like many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, ‘Did he mean it?’ With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it’s clear he did. ” For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt’s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president’s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E. P. A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting   power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell’s   state. Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about   global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules. “Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E. P. A. ,” Mr. McConnell said. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the   consequences of E. P. A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the  . ” Mr. McConnell added: “We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years. ” Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House’s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the   to   legal process of withdrawing the   climate rules and replacing them with looser, more   rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate   greenhouse gases in the first place. Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress’s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.",0,851,15.196428571428571,56,0.34430082256169214,0,0,0,0,96.04328198241242,3.9542107324716005,84.39466174248783,36.068155111633374,0.763807285546416,0.023501762632197415,0.03525264394829612,0.025851938895417155,0.0282021151586369,0.01762632197414806,0.20211515863689777,0.004700352526439483,0.0011750881316098707,0.025851938895417155,0.09048178613396005,0,0.057579318448883664,0.004700352526439483,0.0011750881316098707,0.012925969447708578,0.008225616921269096,0.07050528789659224,0.0011750881316098707,0.05405405405405406,0.0199764982373678,0.05052878965922444,0,0,0.010575793184488837,0.01762632197414806,0.15041128084606345,0,0.0011750881316098707,0.004700352526439483,0,0,0.009400705052878966,0.02702702702702703,0.0023501762632197414,0.0023501762632197414,0.418331374853114,0,0.008225616921269096,0.0023501762632197414,0.0023501762632197414,0.03290246768507638,0.0035252643948296123,0.0023501762632197414,0.01410105757931845,0.008225616921269096,0.0035252643948296123,0.052878965922444184,0.0035252643948296123,0.01527614571092832,0.0011750881316098707,0.010575793184488837,0.0011750881316098707,0.0023501762632197414,0.011750881316098707,0.17391304347826086,0.0035252643948296123,0,0.021151586368977675,0.0963572267920094,0.0799059929494712,0.03525264394829612,0.01645123384253819,0.10810810810810811,0.1492361927144536,0.0681551116333725,0.023501762632197415,0.0011750881316098707,0.0199764982373678,0.11515863689776733,0,0.007050528789659225,0.0035252643948296123,0.0023501762632197414,0.005875440658049354,0,0.0011750881316098707,0.0199764982373678,0.10575793184488837,0.06227967097532315,0,0.01527614571092832,0.0035252643948296123,0.036427732079905996,0.09753231492361927,0.10105757931844889,0.009400705052878966,0.07520564042303172,0,17.35,0,33,3,8,0,8,8,14,15,13,6,1,8,17.35,0,56.35,8,63.625,124.975,56.35,,0.3414252020533512,0,0.4964914524187007,0.08226750961664182,0.19292728076790167,0,0.19292728076790167,0.19292728076790167,0.29494547062671245,0.30949275521837466,0.2797720439513347,0.15202805015514587,0.029013763236249348,0.19292728076790167,0.12141847952899908,0,0.06033352070451565,0.008565539762841617,0.06812280842634974,0.13380979148264138,-0.2351376889991706,0.8661902085173586,42
478,"Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “You can’t make this stuff up. ” So, so wrong. It turns out the subway cricket lady was a prank. The   subway riders? Flimflam. Even, it seems, that      New Yorker the Pizza Rat may have been schooled and rehearsed for the camera. Is no crazy thing sacred, or at least genuine? The subway cricket lady, for those not paying attention, was videotaped last week on the D train as she was supposedly trying to sell crickets and worms out of a bucket. As the story went, a group of teenagers bumped into her and she flew off the handle and dumped the crickets and worms into the train. “Straphangers Go Berserk After Woman Tosses Bugs in Subway Car,” The New York Post reported. The emergency brake was pulled  —   a truly useless maneuver, bringing the train to a dead stop on the Manhattan Bridge. The first reports of this were accompanied by a cellphone video of the chaos. Then another video surfaced and the   reporters Rafi Schwartz and Soraya Auger of Vox noticed that it was quite a polished bit of filmmaking. Through advanced interrogation techniques, they extracted an admission of responsibility from the woman who posted it. She declared herself to be the   and said she was engaged in performance art having something to do with homelessness. The bucket of bugs was knocked out of her hands by another member of her troupe. Who knows how many other passengers were part of the staging or just fated to be along for the ride. Eventually, the brakes were reset and the train moved off the bridge. On Tuesday, having been exposed, she was arrested on a charge of reckless endangerment by the police, who had previously been willing to let her slide. So actually, you can make this stuff up, and be believed. But why bother? The implausible is the daily bread of the subway, served without irony. Real events: Trysts. Preachers. Makeup artists. The “    ” acrobats. Buckets of dead crabs, as Gothamist reported, and a condom tied to a pole on the F train, apparently for weeks, and seemingly, we regret to say,  . All manner of live creatures: chickens, frogs, goldfish, cats, a monkey. And of course, microbes, by the kajillion. (The Central Intelligence Agency took it upon itself in 1966 to see how quickly germs would be propelled through the tunnels via the piston effect of moving trains. At strategic spots, the C. I. A. people dropped light bulbs filled with what they termed innocuous bacteria, then measured how far they traveled.) Then there is the snake guy. “He wasn’t talking at all,” Conor C. Walsh remembered. “He had an intern, a young kid helper, and a duffel bag filled with five or six snakes. ” It was Halloween night two years ago, and Mr. Walsh and some friends were on a train that was moseying to Williamsburg. At first, the man draped the snakes on an overhead handrail. Then he walked through the car with them. “Unless you really protested, he was putting them on people,” Mr. Walsh, 28, said. “There was a   woman shrieking and screaming. He wasn’t going to put it on her. ” Some of the passengers seemed thrilled about having a snake coiled around their bodies. “I don’t like them at all,” Mr. Walsh said. “It’s my one thing. I kept him away, at all times. I was just imagining his apartment, or his warehouse, wherever he kept them. ” Although the man did not speak, he appeared to be marketing the snakes. “He had business cards that he passed out,” Mr. Walsh said, “but no one was walking away with a snake. ” Mr. Walsh, who grew up in New York and teaches high school in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, is also a singer and guitarist with the indie band  . He has put subway exotica to excellent use in his music. “There are days when you hate the subways and days when you meet some awesome people,” he said. “I sat down next to this guy one time, and we got talking, so I asked him what he did. He said: ‘I’m a shaman. I’m an actual shaman. I help my clients speak to the spirits.’ He was a nice kid, 26. Had gone to Hampshire, that college in Massachusetts. ” Mr. Walsh turned his encounter with the young shaman into a brisk, fun pop tune, “Shaman,” which begins: “I met a shaman who grew up in Queens   On the D train his knees touching me. ” After all, there’s magical realism to spare.",0,766,12.766666666666667,60,0.27154046997389036,0,0,0,0,83.97212793733682,18.113729917907463,81.26293133864935,27.942471714534374,0.8080939947780679,0.007832898172323759,0.031331592689295036,0.03655352480417755,0.02610966057441253,0.01174934725848564,0.22845953002610966,0.0039164490861618795,0,0.013054830287206266,0.09921671018276762,0.0013054830287206266,0.0731070496083551,0.009138381201044387,0.0039164490861618795,0.010443864229765013,0.007832898172323759,0.07049608355091384,0.005221932114882507,0.0783289817232376,0.007832898172323759,0.06135770234986945,0,0.0026109660574412533,0.022193211488250653,0.0026109660574412533,0.05483028720626632,0,0,0.0026109660574412533,0.022193211488250653,0,0.010443864229765013,0.0835509138381201,0.0039164490861618795,0.0039164490861618795,0.5117493472584856,0.0026109660574412533,0.0195822454308094,0.0026109660574412533,0.016971279373368148,0.04569190600522193,0.0013054830287206266,0.0026109660574412533,0.014360313315926894,0.0195822454308094,0.018276762402088774,0.04046997389033943,0.005221932114882507,0.03524804177545692,0.01174934725848564,0.01174934725848564,0,0,0.014360313315926894,0.23237597911227154,0.0013054830287206266,0.0013054830287206266,0.030026109660574413,0.08485639686684072,0.05352480417754569,0.07963446475195822,0.013054830287206266,0.030026109660574413,0.13838120104438642,0.12532637075718014,0.0195822454308094,0.0039164490861618795,0.04046997389033943,0.1462140992167102,0.005221932114882507,0.005221932114882507,0.0026109660574412533,0.0026109660574412533,0.007832898172323759,0,0.0013054830287206266,0.04177545691906005,0.12924281984334204,0.06657963446475196,0,0.02349869451697128,0.010443864229765013,0.044386422976501305,0.1422976501305483,0.14882506527415143,0.0026109660574412533,0.02349869451697128,0.007832898172323759,26.25,2,34.051875,1,1,0,4.875,21.975625,20.5,36,6,7,5.75,0,26.25,0,63,4.875,86.051875,141.051875,63,,0.43109807750196566,0.054583639049126324,0.49571177496315255,0.0280575614273374,0.0280575614273374,0,0.12336769934815545,0.3881478051875797,0.37177407002659785,0.5096189432334203,0.14763410387308012,0.16810348658526741,0.1423583892628533,0,0.2878229343817586,0,0.07249279566884313,0.005609561569612861,0.09901811097294969,0.16230547227114606,-0.4848252325641866,0.8376945277288539,38
479,"WASHINGTON  —   Known as a     prosecutor, Rod J. Rosenstein was expected to sail through Senate confirmation to be the Justice Department’s   . But that process has become enmeshed in the drama surrounding questions about President Trump’s campaign ties to Russia. Mr. Rosenstein faces the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday as the president’s nominee for deputy attorney general. In that post, he would oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, because Attorney General Jeff Sessions removed himself from any such cases after the disclosure last week that he had misled Congress about meeting twice with the Russian ambassador. Democrats who have otherwise expressed confidence in Mr. Rosenstein’s prosecutorial skills said they were skeptical that he  —   or anyone besides an independent outside counsel  —   would not be subject to political pressure while overseeing such an investigation. “Rosenstein has a good reputation as a career prosecutor, but this is going to test him, and I worry about the integrity of the Justice Department,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a telephone interview Monday. Through his office, Mr. Rosenstein declined to comment. The F. B. I. which is overseen by the Justice Department, is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. The House Intelligence Committee has also opened an inquiry into whether Russia tried to influence the election. Mr. Rosenstein, who received his law degree from Harvard, is nothing if not a survivor after nearly 12 years as the United States attorney for Maryland under both Republican and Democratic presidents. He was one of only three United States attorneys appointed by the administration of President George W. Bush to be kept in the job by President Barack Obama in 2009  —   and the only one to last all eight years of Mr. Obama’s administration. His supporters say he has been willing to take on politically charged cases throughout his career. Two decades ago, Mr. Rosenstein worked on Kenneth Starr’s independent counsel investigation into the Whitewater affair, earning three convictions related to President Bill Clinton’s business dealings in Arkansas. In a   leak case last year, Mr. Rosenstein extracted a guilty plea from James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, a retired   Marine general and a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had asked Mr. Rosenstein and another prosecutor to handle the investigation after accusations the Obama administration was behind leaks related to a cyberattack and drone strikes. Just last week, Mr. Rosenstein announced the indictments of seven Baltimore police officers on conspiracy and racketeering charges. “He has a reputation for being a straight shooter who plays it right down the middle, and those are important qualities for a deputy attorney general,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, who was the top aide to former Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates and is now in private practice in Washington at the Linklaters law firm. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as the acting attorney general five weeks ago after she refused to defend the initial version of his travel ban in court because she said she was uncertain it was legal. Mr. Leahy, the Vermont senator, said that her firing made the debate over Mr. Rosenstein’s nomination even more important, with “that kind of precedent” hanging over him. Douglas F. Gansler, a former Maryland attorney general, said on Monday, “Rod is about as apolitical a person as you can imagine, which is why he could survive eight years in a Democratic administration after being named by a Republican. ” “Would he stand up to the political winds of President Trump?” he said. “I’d think yes. ” The Justice Department said Monday that if Mr. Rosenstein was confirmed, he would oversee any investigations related not only to the Trump campaign, but also to the president’s transition after the Nov. 8 election. In announcing on Thursday that he would remove himself from such a case, Mr. Sessions had left open the possibility that he might still oversee matters related to the transition period. But in a letter to leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee late on Monday, he said that his recusal “would include any such matters,” as well. That question is important because Michael T. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month, admitted that he had contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, during the transition. Some Democrats have said that those contacts  —   which helped force Mr. Flynn’s resignation  —   might have been illegal. Mr. Sessions also spoke at least twice with Mr. Kislyak: once at the Republican National Convention in July, and again at his Senate office in September, two months before the election. When asked at his confirmation hearing in January about a news article about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, Mr. Sessions responded, “I didn’t have, did not have communications with the Russians. ” Democrats accused him of lying to the committee by not disclosing his conversations with the ambassador, and they called for the Justice Department to open a perjury investigation. In his letter on Monday, Mr. Sessions said that “my answer was correct,” because he said his conversations with the ambassador were not political in nature. In answering the question, Mr. Sessions wrote, “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian ambassador over the years, because the question did not ask about them. ” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, said he was satisfied with the attorney general’s explanation. “I appreciate Attorney General Sessions’s quick action to clear up confusion about his statement,” Mr. Grassley said Monday.",0,948,19.346938775510203,49,0.379746835443038,0,0,0,0,93.06783864002259,9.356408972800304,84.19308820574643,33.03465943339361,0.7721518987341772,0.011603375527426161,0.049578059071729956,0.028481012658227847,0.023206751054852322,0.004219409282700422,0.18143459915611815,0.0010548523206751054,0.004219409282700422,0.016877637130801686,0.08438818565400844,0.0010548523206751054,0.06329113924050633,0.002109704641350211,0.0010548523206751054,0.013713080168776372,0.005274261603375527,0.08966244725738397,0.0010548523206751054,0.052742616033755275,0.027426160337552744,0.04430379746835443,0,0,0.02109704641350211,0.011603375527426161,0.10443037974683544,0,0,0,0.005274261603375527,0,0.004219409282700422,0.06118143459915612,0.004219409282700422,0.004219409282700422,0.4356540084388186,0,0.0189873417721519,0.0010548523206751054,0.00949367088607595,0.03164556962025317,0.0031645569620253164,0.0010548523206751054,0.026371308016877638,0.012658227848101266,0.005274261603375527,0.05907172995780591,0.008438818565400843,0.007383966244725738,0.010548523206751054,0.008438818565400843,0.0010548523206751054,0.0010548523206751054,0.016877637130801686,0.19198312236286919,0.006329113924050633,0,0.020042194092827006,0.07805907172995781,0.08122362869198312,0.052742616033755275,0.012658227848101266,0.08755274261603375,0.14451476793248946,0.08438818565400844,0.010548523206751054,0.0010548523206751054,0.02531645569620253,0.12447257383966245,0,0.005274261603375527,0.002109704641350211,0.0010548523206751054,0.0010548523206751054,0,0,0.039029535864978905,0.14029535864978904,0.06223628691983123,0,0.022151898734177215,0.0031645569620253164,0.05485232067510549,0.10337552742616034,0.10548523206751055,0,0.07383966244725738,0.0010548523206751054,18,0,53,2,1,6,0,25,4.83,43,31.2,3,10,0,18,1,64.03,7,100,167.03,64.03,,0.3650748937956509,0,0.6286700714571656,0.060051130502043144,0.030955006828393312,0.16083655731989654,0,0.4440106820420462,0.13366560005683853,0.5786962917665438,0.49916045303477735,0.08745093208546979,0.24210172369314836,0,0.1827439976315568,0.030955006828393312,0.06040395083158024,0.006603586690942709,0.09433695272775298,0.1575710121411658,-0.6190416635259587,0.8424289878588342,55
480,"LOS ANGELES  —     anthropomorphic food. Meryl Streep as a clueless opera singer. A furry, folksy Disney dragon. Bank robbers in   West Texas. It was a weekend of unusually   new offerings at North American theaters, and it worked out well for Hollywood  —   for the most part. As expected, “Suicide Squad” (Warner) led the box office pack for a second weekend, taking in an estimated $43. 8 million, for a new domestic total of $222. 9 million, according to comScore. But the film also   dropping 67 percent weekend to weekend, as its Rotten Tomatoes grade from critics caught up to it and the fanboy audience turned toward the   animated “Sausage Party. ” Backed by a crackerjack marketing campaign, “Sausage Party” (Sony) collected about $33. 6 million, beating the prerelease expectations of some box office analysts and proving once again that audiences respond to original concepts. “Sausage Party,” with character voices provided by Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig, was also relatively cheap: Sony and Annapurna Pictures split the $19 million in production expenses. “Pete’s Dragon” (Disney) was third. Ticket sales totaled $21. 5 million, a bit less than anticipated. This   remake charmed most critics, but its crowd appeal was limited. Disney said on Sunday that 33 percent of the   audience was under the age of 12. “Pete’s Dragon” cost about $65 million to make. Playing in less than half as many theaters, the Meryl Streep vehicle “Florence Foster Jenkins” (Paramount) began its run with $6. 6 million in ticket sales, on par with expectations for a period film aimed at older women. (Paramount said on Sunday that 97 percent of the audience was over the age of 25.) While Ms. Streep has lost some of her box office sizzle in recent years, she continues to be adored by critics, receiving strong enough reviews in this modestly budgeted film to spark early awards buzz. Also of note: “Hell or High Water” (Lionsgate and CBS Films) a $12 million Texas heist thriller that has received euphoric reviews and stars Jeff Bridges, began a slow,   rollout, arriving in 32 theaters and collecting $592, 000, for a hefty   average of $18, 500.",0,355,15.434782608695652,23,0.36619718309859156,0,0,0,0,98.16930258018701,16.730281690140842,58.89815817984832,63.150595882990245,0.7661971830985915,0.011267605633802818,0.059154929577464786,0.022535211267605635,0.04225352112676056,0.011267605633802818,0.23943661971830985,0.0028169014084507044,0,0.005633802816901409,0.0676056338028169,0,0.02535211267605634,0.014084507042253521,0,0.008450704225352112,0.005633802816901409,0.05352112676056338,0.005633802816901409,0.0647887323943662,0.03380281690140845,0.05352112676056338,0,0.0028169014084507044,0.016901408450704224,0.008450704225352112,0.061971830985915494,0,0,0,0.011267605633802818,0,0.011267605633802818,0.04507042253521127,0.0028169014084507044,0.0028169014084507044,0.3408450704225352,0,0.011267605633802818,0.0028169014084507044,0,0.03380281690140845,0.005633802816901409,0.014084507042253521,0.005633802816901409,0,0.059154929577464786,0,0.022535211267605635,0.022535211267605635,0,0.011267605633802818,0,0.0028169014084507044,0.09859154929577464,0.24225352112676057,0.03380281690140845,0.016901408450704224,0.016901408450704224,0.0676056338028169,0.11830985915492957,0.005633802816901409,0.030985915492957747,0.030985915492957747,0.15774647887323945,0.03943661971830986,0.03943661971830986,0,0.04507042253521127,0.14366197183098592,0.0028169014084507044,0.005633802816901409,0.005633802816901409,0.0028169014084507044,0.0028169014084507044,0,0,0.005633802816901409,0.04225352112676056,0.061971830985915494,0.0028169014084507044,0.014084507042253521,0,0.0676056338028169,0.07323943661971831,0.059154929577464786,0,0.03380281690140845,0,13.375,0,18.025,0,0,0,0,16.35,24.655,9.45,1,20.55,10,0,13.375,0,68.28,2,43.475,110.305,68.28,,0.3840895261316935,0,0.4566457533665724,0,0,0,0,0.4325670259307392,0.5347853339481103,0.3058488931569061,0.04454817121901355,0.4893135516886877,0.3179891830424227,0,0.3949490464143221,0,0.15507432348031477,0.0045423059015909425,0.09873837453583312,0.25051952623749446,0.6205787844576861,0.7494804737625056,25
481,"Several health insurers will raise premiums by roughly 20 percent on plans sold through Obamacare exchanges. [The biggest Obamacare rate hikes will take place in Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, which will ask for premiums on average higher than 30 percent in 2018. In Maryland, the average premium from CareFirst will rise by at least 50 percent. Oregon, North Carolina, and Maine health insurers will raise premiums by 20 percent or higher.  The health insurers’ rate hikes reflect the continuing collapse of Obamacare, as many state Obamacare exchanges continue to experience insurers exiting the Obamacare exchanges. Insurers also remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s potential decision to discontinue subsidies for health insurers to lower the cost of premiums. Conservatives argue that the Obamacare subsidies amount to handouts to large health conglomerates. Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan, said, “It’s still a very volatile market. There are so many uncertainties. ” Notter argues that the individual health care market continues to experience turbulence through the uncertainty that comes out of D. C. Republicans, who passed a health care bill through the House, point to insurers’ rate hikes and withdrawals from Obamacare exchanges as fundamental problems with the Affordable Care Act. “The laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars,” a White House official said. Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) argues that Republicans’ attempt to repeal Obamacare, as well as President Trump’s threat to remove subsidies to health insurers, created the health insurance rate hikes. Kaine said, “These actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition. ” Kevin Lewis, the chief executive at Maine Community Health Options, said that its 19. 6 percent increase in 2018 arises from healthy people exiting the Obamacare markets. “It’s the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market,” Lewis said. “It’s a bit of a   prophecy. ” President Donald Trump, citing that two million Americans have withdrawn from their Obamacare plans since signing up in January, declared that Obamacare is in a “ . ” 2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!  —   Donald J.

482,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama, dedicating the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, said it would tell an American story, one of “suffering and delight, one of fear, but also of hope, of wandering in the wilderness, and then seeing, out on the horizon, a glimmer of the Promised Land. ” Speaking to dignitaries and thousands of people watching from the National Mall, Mr. Obama said the museum would document the stories of Americans who are often overlooked in history books  —   “the president but also the slave, the industrialist but also the porter, the keeper of the status quo, but also the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo. ” On a day rich in symbolism, under a gray sky that seemed to capture the ambiguity of the black American experience, Mr. Obama warned that the museum would not be a panacea for the nation’s racial struggles, which, even today, inflame the streets of cities like Charlotte, N. C. “A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city,” he said. “It won’t eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind. ” But Mr. Obama said the museum’s exhibits would put those problems into a larger context, allowing people to see the progress as well as the shortcomings in American society. He said he hoped it would encourage a dialogue among Americans on difficult issues like the systemic racism in law enforcement or the violence toward police officers. “Hopefully,” the president said, “this museum can help us talk to each other, and more importantly listen to each other, and most importantly see each other. ” “Perhaps they can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of a demonstrator in Ferguson and Charlotte,” Mr. Obama said. And perhaps, he said, it could help a black visitor see the efforts of police officers who, “in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing. ” Acts of protest, Mr. Obama said, are acts of patriotism, whether it was sitting at a lunch counter in the South in the 1960s or wearing a   emblazoned with the words “I can’t breathe,” as Eric Garner, gasping facedown on a sidewalk in Staten Island, said before he died. Mr. Obama has articulated these themes before, most notably in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the protest march in Selma, Ala. But on Saturday, his tone was less anguished or exhortatory than it has been in the past. He was clearly rejoicing in the glorious history contained in this newest outpost of the Smithsonian Institution. “We’ve shown the world we can float like butterflies and sting like bees,” Mr. Obama said, not even needing to mention the author of that boast, Muhammad Ali, who died three months ago.   he said, can “rock like Jimi” and “stir the pot like Richard Pryor. ” “We’re not a burden on America or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America,” the president added. “We’re America. ” Mr. Obama officially opened the museum by ringing a large bell from an   black church in Virginia, in an echo of bells rung to mark the emancipation of the slaves. He spoke against the majestic bronze backdrop of the museum, a kind of inverted ziggurat not far from the Washington Monument. In its shadow, viewers were spread across the lawn and pressed against a fence, listening intently to the president. His speech was the centerpiece of a solemn, yet quietly jubilant, ceremony featuring the civil rights leader John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder, who joked of the museum, “I haven’t seen it yet, but I’m going to. ” Ms. LaBelle got a huge roar from the crowd when, at the end of her emotional rendition of the civil rights anthem “A Change Is Gonna Come,” she added the words, “Hillary Clinton. ” There was a panoply of dignitaries, including George W. Bush, who signed the legislation authorizing the building of the museum, and his wife, Laura, who spoke of her early brainstorming discussions with the museum’s director, Lonnie Bunch. Bill Clinton watched from the front row, sitting alongside Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson sat nearby. “This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the principles of liberty held thousands in chains,” Mr. Bush declared. “Even today, the journey towards justice is not compete. But this museum will inspire us to go farther and get there faster. ” The museum, Mr. Bush said, celebrated several of his heroes, including the musician Chuck Berry, the baseball player Willie Mays and the Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. spoke of the legacy of racism, enshrined in Jim Crow laws, and how the fight for justice flowed through  —   and was sometimes set back by  —   landmark court rulings, from the Dred Scott case to Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. To understand the real Dred Scott, Chief Justice Roberts said, one should visit this museum. Donna Sampson Rawlings, 59, of Ashton, Md. who watched the ceremony on a screen on the Mall, said the event brought back memories of her father, and of “all the people who weren’t here who did things to get us here. ” She said she had toured the museum last week during a special program. Many of the visitors were older, she said, and “I had to step back and think, ‘This is their lives. ’” “If you’re 80 years old, you went through so much of this,” she added. “Seeing it is, for them, emotional. It’s something they never thought they’d see. ” “These are the stories that we talk about that nobody knows,” she said. Johnnie Wilson, of Springfield, Va. said he had fought in Vietnam “for the nation’s rights, knowing that back home we didn’t have the rights. ” He said the museum compensated for what he believed was a sanitized version of history taught in schools. “Throughout the time we’ve been on these shores, we’ve made major contributions to America,” he said. “We’re really part of an American history that isn’t told like it should be in classrooms. ” Mr. Obama, who was given a sneak peek of the museum recently with his family, spoke during his speech of a stone slaver’s block on exhibit, marked only as the site of a speech by Andrew Jackson in 1830. It was, the president said, “a stone where day after day for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle, on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet. ” The museum, Mr. Obama said, would make visitors face uncomfortable truths. But it would also capture the essential greatness of the United States  —   the perpetual struggle to live up to its highest ideals. Mr. Obama spoke emotionally of his many flights on Marine One across the Mall, past the alabaster spire of the Washington Monument and the lighted figure of Abraham Lincoln, sheltered in his memorial. He said he had watched the museum rise from the ground and thought of the days when he and his family would return to visit it as private citizens. “We’ll walk away that much more in love with this country,” he said, “the only place on earth where this story could have unfolded. ”",0,1277,21.64406779661017,59,0.30618637431480034,0,0,0,0,94.34360045244932,9.127731397298579,81.39776503206416,24.526429130775256,0.7963978073610023,0.006264682850430697,0.031323414252153486,0.028974158183241974,0.03837118245888802,0.020360219263899765,0.22004698512137824,0.003915426781519186,0.003915426781519186,0.018010963194988253,0.10806577916992952,0,0.052466718872357085,0.010180109631949883,0.003915426781519186,0.00548159749412686,0.007830853563038372,0.0759592795614722,0,0.09240407204385279,0.025841816758026624,0.0548159749412686,0,0.0023492560689115116,0.02975724353954581,0.014878621769772905,0.08535630383711824,0,0.003915426781519186,0.0015661707126076742,0.009397024275646046,0,0.007830853563038372,0.06734534064212999,0.0007830853563038371,0.0007830853563038371,0.46985121378230227,0.0031323414252153485,0.031323414252153486,0.0031323414252153485,0.0031323414252153485,0.04541895066562255,0.0031323414252153485,0.0015661707126076742,0.01096319498825372,0.014095536413469069,0.025058731401722788,0.03210649960845732,0.00548159749412686,0.014095536413469069,0.01096319498825372,0.01957713390759593,0.0015661707126076742,0.0015661707126076742,0.010180109631949883,0.2028191072826938,0.003915426781519186,0,0.05090054815974941,0.05794831636648395,0.05559906029757244,0.0485512920908379,0.018794048551292093,0.056382145653876274,0.1456538762725137,0.09397024275646046,0.01644479248238058,0,0.047768206734534066,0.1284259984338293,0.0015661707126076742,0.004698512137823023,0.0023492560689115116,0.003915426781519186,0.01644479248238058,0,0.0007830853563038371,0.0274079874706343,0.12059514487079091,0.07517619420516837,0,0.018794048551292093,0.00548159749412686,0.04385277995301488,0.11902897415818324,0.1284259984338293,0.01096319498825372,0.020360219263899765,0.0015661707126076742,34,3,94,1,1,4,24,25,20,45,28,51,30.21875,10,34,0,141.21875,42,194.5,359.71875,141.21875,,0.49743143906672665,0.08031885928600001,0.7323659823647176,0.02828764043650156,0.02828764043650156,0.10429940919118673,0.4113031023033909,0.4212219853439341,0.36797764293936763,0.5670996883330294,0.4490696618429026,0.5975316454564376,0.46800072883939176,0.22547340809847535,0.7109734789133533,0,0.09118424504126395,0.027119191266974717,0.12558768336729959,0.23226860913254907,-0.6868692714081326,0.7677313908674509,88
483,"An organization partnered with   groups that calls itself the Revolutionary Love Project distributed an actual script with   talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess. [The script provides    language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. ”  It asks activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing President Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.  The script is entitled, “#NoBanNoWallNoRaids Talking Points for Congressional Townhalls. ” It ends with contact information for activists from two groups heavily financed by billionaire George Soros  —   Avideh Moussavian at the National Immigration Law Center and Deepa Iyer at the Center for Social Inclusion. Contacted by Breitbart News, Moussavian confirmed his group “contributed” to the script “in response to overwhelming concern and fear stemming from the January 27th executive order that sought to ban the entry of refugees and Muslims and in response to mounting questions from community members about how to express these concerns to policy makers. ” Despite Moussavian’s claims, Trump’s executive order did not seek to ban Muslims from entering the U. S. It temporarily halted the refugee program while the flawed security screening process could be reworked. The   script for activists is meant to aid a project driven by the George   MoveOn. org group declaring the week of February     —   the first congressional recess of the 115th Congress  —   to be “Resistance Recess. ” The project called on activists to show up at “elected officials’ events, town halls, and other public appearances to make it clear to those who represent us in Congress, as well as to the media, that tolerance of the Trump Administration’s hurtful policies is intolerable, that indifference or idleness is not acceptable, that complacency is politically toxic. ” A blast email from the Revolutionary Love Project urged supporters to use the talking points “script” to “voice your concern” when meeting last week with constituents during the Congressional recess. The actual script recommends that activists say the following in stages: Stage 1: Who You Are. My name is ______ and I’m a resident of _______. Add a description of your connection to the community. Stage 2: Your Concerns. I am particularly concerned about the Administration’s efforts to  target and criminalize immigrants, refugees and people entering our country from   countries. I want you as a representative of our district to understand the impact of Trump’s executive orders and to take action. The script provides talking points and urges activists to use the language to “buttress your concerns. ” The talking points deploy key words like “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia” as suggested descriptions of Trump’s temporary refugee halt as well as the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Here are some talking points provided: *Trump’s executive orders to deport undocumented immigrants, to punish   sanctuary cities for defending the Constitution, to ban people from seven   countries, and to shut the door on refugees all have one thing in common: they are rooted in hate, bigotry and a desire to instill fear rather than promote unity. We call this xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. *Each of these executive orders is based on the false premise that immigrants pose a threat to us. They are hateful attacks not only on those newly arriving or seeking entry into the U. S. but to those of us, including U. S. citizens, who have raised families here, paid taxes for years and who have made enormous sacrifices and contributions. *The policy changes called for in the executive orders are extremist, costly and ineffective, and they will not make us safer. They have wreaked havoc and confusion in airports across the globe and at home, in our schools, workplaces, and backyards. *We are witnessing a massive militarization of our deportation force, and a supersizing of interior and border patrol agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are occurring in homes and workplaces, and the climate of fear as a result of rumored and reported raids are paralyzing our communities. Parents are afraid to send their children to school. Pregnant mothers are afraid to get basic nutrition assistance and prenatal care. We are separating families, hurting our economy and targeting the most vulnerable, without accountability from our federal government that is causing this devastation. The script asks representatives to “forcefully condemn” Trump’s immigration and border security agendas and to “support legislation in Congress that would block implementation and nullify the effects of these orders and prevent any funding for them. ” The National Immigration Law Center, which is listed on the talking points memo, was party to a lawsuit last month that temporarily blocked Trump’s original executive order. The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society earmarked for general support. The second group listed on the talking points memo, the Center for Social Inclusion, is also the recipient of numerous Open Society grants. The Revolutionary Love Project, which distributed the script, is partnered with numerous   groups, including T’ruah and Trinity United Church of Christ, which was formerly led by Jeremiah Wright Jr. Barack Obama’s infamous radical pastor for nearly twenty years. The Project is partnered with the organizers of last month’s Women’s March. Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

484,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump’s latest meeting with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, went smoothly. They pledged cooperation on trade, investment and border security. And, joined by Ivanka Trump, they met with female executives and announced an initiative to assist women in business. In private talks, Mr. Trudeau was expected to welcome the prospect of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that could test his commitment to internationalist principles. _____ 2. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was greeted with higher approval ratings when he returned home from his weekend golf outing with Mr. Trump in Florida. But there was surprise in the United States as it became clear that the two leaders discussed their response to North Korea’s missile test in full view of diners at Mr. Trump’s    resort, with aides pointing the lights from their smartphones at briefing documents. North Korea claims its launch shows progress toward   capabilities. The National Security Council, normally the president’s main arm to develop foreign policy, is in turmoil from top to bottom. Michael Flynn was said to have resigned as national security adviser following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russia. _____ 3. On the homefront, Mr. Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, the financier Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed by the Senate. And Republicans are hitting a roadblock in their quest to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act: Constituents upset that there is no plan to replace it have made themselves heard at public meetings in California, Utah and Wisconsin. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who faced a frustrated crowd on Saturday. _____ 4. Inside Trump Tower, the president’s sons talked to The Times about pressing on with global deals  —   and rebutting waves of criticism over ethical concerns. “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric Trump said during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” _____ 5. More harrowing details about the suffering of civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo: Canisters of chlorine gas, a banned weapon, were dumped on residential areas at least eight times in the final weeks of the battle to retake the city from rebels, Human Rights Watch reported. And a separate analysis drawing on satellite images, security videos, social media and TV footage indicates that Russia, contrary to its repeated claims, bombed a major hospital in the city multiple times. _____ 6. A California dam’s spillway appears to have stabilized, but evacuation orders remain in place for more than 180, 000 people as state authorities try to make emergency repairs before more rains come. Emergency shelters filled with residents while workers and experts swarmed the Oroville Dam, the tallest in the United States. “The big fear, again, is that potential for catastrophic failure,” one official said. _____ 7. Modern goddesses ruled the Grammys: Adele and Beyoncé brought dramatic spectacles. The big story after the show, though, was the   of Beyoncé in the top categories. “It was #GrammysSoWhite come to life,” our critic writes. We rounded up the best and worst of the performances, and here’s the red carpet. _____ 8. The American College of Physicians offers a new way to take care of your lower back pain: Wait it out. Take some aspirin if you really need it. Concerned about the epidemic of opioid addiction, the group says patients should try exercise, acupuncture, massage or yoga before resorting to prescription drugs. _____ 9. The dairy industry wants us to call almond, soy and coconut milk   …     something else. Dairy farmers are calling on Congress to stop makers of increasingly popular   alternatives from labeling them yogurt, milk or cheese, saying consumers could mistakenly equate their nutritional profiles. Our reporter wonders: “What about other nondairy products with dairy names? Will milk of magnesia, cocoa butter, cream of wheat and peanut butter have to change their names as well?” _____ 10. Finally, a reminder you may not need: Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day. We’d like to draw your attention to one of our most popular articles ever: “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love. ” In our latest Modern Love podcast, the actor David Oyelowo reads “Seeing the World Through My Wife’s Eyes,” about a man whose spouse helps him cope when he loses his sight. And our “Committed” series explores the   history of wedding announcements in The Times, with updates on noteworthy couples, milestones like the first gay wedding announcements and some pretty amazing wedding fashions, like those big pouffy ’80s gowns. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

485,"On Monday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” host Katy Tur asked Senator Deb Fischer ( ) asked if she thought President Trump was heading down “a dangerous path” because Trump has avoided criticizing Vladimir Putin, Putin has killed journalists, and “Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and his distaste for any news that doesn’t agree with him here. ”  Tur asked, “Why  —   what is your sense of why this president is going above and beyond, bending over backwards, if you will, to stay away from criticizing the Russian president? And it’s almost  —   give him an excuse. As we know, there’s, since 2000, been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia who came out against the government there. Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and his distaste for any news that doesn’t agree with him here. Do you find that this is a dangerous path he is heading down?” (  NewsBusters) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,166,23.714285714285715,7,0.26506024096385544,0,0,0,0,64.72843755976287,16.10100401606426,84.71658060814687,1.6249114103472713,0.7951807228915663,0,0.04216867469879518,0.060240963855421686,0.05421686746987952,0.012048192771084338,0.20481927710843373,0.018072289156626505,0.012048192771084338,0.030120481927710843,0.03614457831325301,0.012048192771084338,0.0963855421686747,0.006024096385542169,0,0.03614457831325301,0,0.1144578313253012,0,0.060240963855421686,0.018072289156626505,0.05421686746987952,0,0.012048192771084338,0.018072289156626505,0.012048192771084338,0.08433734939759036,0,0,0,0.006024096385542169,0,0.03614457831325301,0.04819277108433735,0,0,0.4939759036144578,0.006024096385542169,0,0,0,0.04819277108433735,0.018072289156626505,0,0.04216867469879518,0.024096385542168676,0.006024096385542169,0.03614457831325301,0,0.05421686746987952,0.024096385542168676,0.04216867469879518,0.006024096385542169,0,0.012048192771084338,0.30120481927710846,0.018072289156626505,0.012048192771084338,0.006024096385542169,0.024096385542168676,0.04216867469879518,0.06626506024096386,0.012048192771084338,0.05421686746987952,0.1566265060240964,0.1144578313253012,0.018072289156626505,0.012048192771084338,0.04819277108433735,0.14457831325301204,0,0,0.018072289156626505,0,0,0,0,0.04216867469879518,0.12048192771084337,0.0783132530120482,0,0.030120481927710843,0,0.024096385542168676,0.19879518072289157,0.20481927710843373,0.006024096385542169,0.024096385542168676,0.018072289156626505,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,14,2,25,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,55,56,3,,0,0,0.6697893816771066,0,0,0,0,0.541960108450192,0.14459058185587106,0.6787546615361221,0,0,0.0779292055122247,0,0.3717045820153256,0,0.014563106796116505,0,0.2669902912621359,0.27184466019417475,-0.8614034875483222,0.7281553398058253,16

487,"The Los Angeles Times reported early Sunday morning that Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic leaders in the state legislature made $1 billion in side deals to ensure the passage of a   hike in the state gasoline tax last week. [The Times said:    …     Brown and legislative dealers promised nearly $1 billion for the pet projects of lawmakers who had been sitting on the fence before they were persuaded to vote for the bill. The funding “arrangements,” as Brown called them, helped the governor and legislators break a   Sacramento stalemate on transportation funding. Some legislators said the   taints the legislative process, but Brown defended the deals as justified, a moderate investment compared with the payoff of a bill that will generate $5. 2 billion annually in the first 10 years for road repairs, and billions more in future years. One of the more prominent deals was the one that secured the vote of State Sen. Anthony Canella ( ) who was the only Republican in either chamber to support the measure, which includes raised fees at the Department of Motor Vehicles. That side deal turns out to have been the costliest of all, amounting to $400 million in pork for “the extension of the Altamont Corridor Express, a commuter rail line between the Bay Area and Central Valley. ” Canella’s vote was crucial, because moderate State Sen. Steve Glazer ( ) opposed the gas tax, explaining in a statement published by the East Bay Times that it was unnecessary to raise taxes rather than   spending from the costly   rail project. Canella was unrepentant, telling the Los Angeles Times: “I got the things I asked for, so apparently I made the most compelling case. ” Despite the pork for his home district, Cannella seemed to realize that his vote would be unpopular, tweeting on April 6 that he was avoiding social media. I think I’m going to stay off social media today  …      —   Anthony Cannella (@AnthonyCannella) April 6, 2017,   The gas tax required a   vote in each chamber to pass. Joel B.

488,"MONTGOMERY, Ala.  —   Gov. Robert Bentley resigned Monday, his power and popularity diminished by a sex scandal that staggered the state, brought him to the brink of impeachment and prompted a series of criminal investigations. Ellen Brooks, a special prosecutor, said Mr. Bentley quit in connection with a plea agreement on two misdemeanor charges: failing to file a major contribution report and knowingly converting campaign contributions to personal use. He pleaded guilty Monday afternoon. It was a stunning downfall for the governor, a Republican who acknowledged in March 2016 that he had made sexually charged remarks to his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. “I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama’s governor,” Mr. Bentley said at the State Capitol. He did not mention the charges to which he pleaded guilty, or the deal with prosecutors that mandated his resignation. His exit from government and guilty pleas followed mounting calls for his resignation, especially after a report that was made public on Friday said he had fostered “an atmosphere of intimidation” and compelled state employees to help him cover up his relationship with Ms. Mason. Impeachment hearings  —   the first in Alabama in more than a century  —   began Monday morning, when the State House was consumed by rumors that the governor would soon quit. Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey succeeded Mr. Bentley. A former state treasurer, she is the second woman to hold the office. She is a graduate of Auburn University and was a high school teacher and a bank officer before working for the Legislature. “The Ivey administration will be open, it will be transparent and it will be honest,” Ms. Ivey said. Mr. Bentley, 74, repeatedly denied having a physical relationship with Ms. Mason and long insisted that he had not broken any laws, but he was a subject of multiple investigations, including reviews by the F. B. I. and the Alabama attorney general’s office. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission said it had probable cause to find that Mr. Bentley had committed felonies, and it asked a district attorney to consider prosecuting him. Two days later, a lawyer hired by the Alabama House of Representatives released a report portraying Mr. Bentley as deceitful and desperate before his relationship with Ms. Mason made him a punch line. The   report said Mr. Bentley had offered little cooperation to legislative investigators, and it alleged that the governor’s critics had been subjected to coercion, including harassing messages and the threat of prosecution. The report described how Mr. Bentley tried to use a member of his security detail to break up with Ms. Mason on his behalf and how he demanded that Ms. Mason be allowed to travel in official vehicles after she left the state’s payroll. It also explored Mr. Bentley’s efforts to keep audio recordings of suggestive conversations with Ms. Mason from the public. In one such conversation, which rippled across the internet last year, the governor described embracing Ms. Mason and placing his hands on her breasts. By the weekend, legislative leaders had demanded that the governor quit, echoing a faction of    members in his own party who spent months vocally opposing him. On Sunday night, the steering committee of the Alabama Republican Party made a similar call. And by sunset Monday, Mr. Bentley was out of power. In court documents, the Alabama attorney general’s office said Mr. Bentley had failed to disclose a $50, 000 personal loan to his campaign account. The office also said Mr. Bentley had allowed nearly $9, 000 of campaign money to be used for Ms. Mason’s lawyers. Mr. Bentley was sentenced to a suspended jail term, fined $7, 000, placed on probation and ordered to complete community service. In an email on Monday, Ms. Mason declined to comment. Yet until Mr. Bentley’s court appearance, it was unclear that he would actually abandon the job to which he was easily   in 2014. Hours before the special counsel’s report became public on Friday, Mr. Bentley repeated his familiar pledge not to resign, and he pleaded for an end to the debate that stemmed from his personal conduct. “The people of this state have never asked to be told of or shown the intimate and embarrassing details of my personal life and my personal struggles,” the governor said outside the Capitol. “Those who are taking pleasure in humiliating and in shaming me, shaming my family, shaming my friends, well, I really don’t understand why they want to do that. ” Within days, Mr. Bentley resigned. The decision punctuated a sordid drama that exploded last year, prompting renewed scrutiny of his 2015 divorce from Dianne Bentley, his wife of 50 years. Mr. Bentley’s complaints and apologies over more than a year did little to quell public outrage in Alabama, where he had cultivated a reputation as an ethically sound public official. Now, he is the first Alabama governor to quit since 1837, when Clement Comer Clay left Montgomery to become a United States senator. (In 1993, Guy Hunt was automatically removed from office after being convicted of an ethics charge he was later pardoned.) Mr. Bentley’s resignation is the third major transfer of power in Alabama government since June, when the House speaker, Michael G. Hubbard, was convicted of ethics charges and forced from office. Later in the year, Chief Justice Roy S. Moore was suspended for the balance of his term for violating judicial ethics standards. Mr. Bentley, a dermatologist, was a legislative backbencher until he stunned Alabama with his successful campaign for governor in 2010. In the early months of his tenure, he was widely praised for his response to a tornado outbreak that devastated much of the state. His policy legacy, at least among many Republicans, will be mixed. He opposed   marriage and, within months of taking office, approved what was then one of the country’s most aggressive immigration laws. But he also called for higher taxes and, in 2015, surprised many people when he unilaterally ordered four Confederate flags lowered on the grounds of the State Capitol. He also refused to endorse Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign. But Mr. Bentley’s personal conduct placed some of the greatest stress on his ties to members of his own party, and those conflicts worsened as he clung to power. “It’s sad watching anyone fall,” State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican, said Monday. “I hate that it all happened, but I’m thankful that the governor stepped aside. We can begin to put this behind us. ”",0,1099,18.948275862068964,58,0.3685168334849864,0,0,0,0,93.42313166498559,4.668266176798806,87.9753950715864,14.466746629167014,0.7898089171974523,0.01364877161055505,0.044585987261146494,0.020928116469517744,0.050955414012738856,0.020018198362147407,0.17652411282984531,0.007279344858962694,0.00818926296633303,0.014558689717925387,0.08098271155595996,0,0.05368516833484986,0.006369426751592357,0.0018198362147406734,0.01637852593266606,0.004549590536851683,0.050955414012738856,0.0009099181073703367,0.06278434940855324,0.020928116469517744,0.04549590536851683,0,0,0.011828935395814377,0.00272975432211101,0.12465878070973613,0,0.003639672429481347,0.0009099181073703367,0.014558689717925387,0,0.00545950864422202,0.059144676979071886,0.0018198362147406734,0.0018198362147406734,0.42766151046405826,0.00272975432211101,0.012738853503184714,0.003639672429481347,0.010009099181073703,0.036396724294813464,0.0018198362147406734,0,0.009099181073703366,0.01364877161055505,0.007279344858962694,0.06369426751592357,0.010009099181073703,0.009099181073703366,0.004549590536851683,0.026387625113739762,0.0009099181073703367,0.0009099181073703367,0.022747952684258416,0.19199272065514103,0.00545950864422202,0.0009099181073703367,0.015468607825295723,0.0791628753412193,0.0718835304822566,0.060964513193812554,0.018198362147406732,0.09190172884440401,0.14285714285714285,0.09736123748862602,0.01091901728844404,0,0.012738853503184714,0.1292083712465878,0,0.003639672429481347,0.003639672429481347,0.01091901728844404,0.0018198362147406734,0,0.00272975432211101,0.048225659690627844,0.14194722474977253,0.059144676979071886,0,0.00818926296633303,0.0009099181073703367,0.06005459508644222,0.09463148316651501,0.10373066424021839,0.0018198362147406734,0.05732484076433121,0,43.25,0,120.85,4,5,6,4,42,4.83,51,18,19,27,0,43.25,17.5,108.08,27.5,255.1,383.68,108.08,,0.559444917719928,0,0.7801365788959638,0.10510060395752727,0.12801221467776563,0.1497799256148726,0.10510060395752727,0.5522045451360634,0.1242003709734936,0.5995854203161048,0.3457630492504192,0.3580934692180266,0.4421968996752335,0,0.692634690447552,0.33941847473783193,0.0777733003281331,0.019788728340337344,0.18356743998618386,0.27609233780438663,-0.8592475729052357,0.7239076621956133,93
489,"The FBI arrested the wife of Omar Mateen, the jihadi responsible for a massacre at Orlando’s Pulse night club last year, on Monday morning in San Francisco on charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting the attempted provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization. [Salman will make a court appearance on Tuesday, her lawyer told ABC News. She was indicted in Tampa, Florida and is expected to relocate there to face charges in the case.  Mateen killed 49 people at an Orlando, Florida nightclub on June 12, 2016 and left more than 50 others injured. During the prolonged attack on the Pulse nightclub, Mateen called    pledged allegiance to ISIS and spoke of the Boston Marathon Islamic terrorist bombers. Mateen was eventually shot and killed in a standoff with law enforcement. After the attack, reports revealed allegations that Mateen attended the Islamic Center Fort Pierce for 13 years or more. Salman had told the Washington Post that her husband “wasn’t very religious. ” A Florida gun shop owner had also alerted the FBI after a suspicious man came in inquiring about body armor, which the owner refused to sell it to him. The FBI had investigated Mateen in the past as a potential terrorist. Media reports initially put heavy emphasis on reporting that Mateen may have been mentally ill or harbored repressed homosexual tendencies. The FBI found no evidence of the latter, instead finding evidence he may have had a romantic relationship with a woman other than his wife. Authorities eventually released the seventeen pages of    transcripts from Mateen’s phone call on the night of the massacre, which revealed that he ranted about America’s fight against the Islamic State. Breitbart News previously reported on these transcripts and specific motives Mateen spelled out in his    rant.

492,"Can nuclear war break out on the Korean Peninsula? 02.11.2016 Print version Font Size Does China support Pyongyang? Can the Chinese intervene in a possible conflict between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States? Senior officer at the Center for Korean Studies at the Institute of the Far East, Yevgeny Kim, gave an interview to Pravda.Ru, in which we spoke about North Korea's nuclear program and the possibility of the denuclearization of South-East Asia. ""North Korea is a closed and little known country in many ways. Yet, who raised the question of a nuclear threat? After all, there are American atomic bombs in South Korea."" ""China has been involved in this actively during the recent years, but one should not attach much importance to it. The mandate of the six-party talks was about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The question is not only about the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea . One should remove US nuclear bombs from South Korea and exclude a possibility for any type of nuclear weapons to appear on the Korean Peninsula on the whole. ""US nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear weapons, US aircraft carriers with nuclear weapons and US aircraft with nuclear weapons violate the regime of the nuclear-free zone in South Korea. Look at the Goa Declaration that was signed by the leaders of Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa. There are more than one hundred articles in this lengthy declaration, but it contains no word about the North Korean nuclear issue.""Last year's BRICS declaration did not mention anything about the the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the leaders of the five countries do not believe that North Korea is guilty of this problem."" ""Vladimir Putin said once that no one will touch a country if this country has a nuclear bomb. If it does not have a nuclear bomb, this country may experience the fate of Libya. What is Russia's stance on North Korea? Does Russia recognize the right of North Korea to have a nuclear bomb?"" ""The Americans would have shipped air defense systems to South Korea regardless of what kind of weapons North Korea would have had - nuclear or not. Russia is one of the great powers that has nuclear weapons, but Russia is not interested in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia would not like to see the emergence of new nuclear powers in the world. ""At the same time, Russia understands why other countries have nuclear weapons. Russia always says that all countries should proceed from the interests of equal security. Why should the USA be worried about the presence of nuclear weapons in North Korea? North Korea cannot attack the USA. Even if North Korea has launched missiles into space , it does not mean that those missiles can carry nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons have to be delivered to the territory of another state, and a missile has to reenter the atmosphere, where plasma can destroy it, but the missile has to remain guidable in such conditions to deliver its nuclear weapons to the target. North Korea does not have the technology."" ""Why does China keep silence?"" ""China understands the reason, for which North Korea has to develop its nuclear weapons. The Chinese realize that the Americans deploy air defense complexes to contain China and Russia, not North Korea. The Americans do not even hide the fact that they have another nuclear warhead to be delivered to Germany. Nowadays, one can test and further improve nuclear weapons without a physical explosion, and North Korea would need to switch to methods of mathematical analysis."" ""What will determine the economic development of North Korea - Sangun or reforms?"" ""Reforms, definitely. Sangun - the policy of the supremacy of the army - appeared in the mid-1990s, when the country was in dire straits. The country was forced to unite as a military camp and create the mobilization economy. Sangun made it possible to overcome a very difficult period in the history of North Korea, and the country continued its development, where rigid military control was not required. Now they conduct reforms."" ""Do you think a nuclear war may break out on the Korean Peninsula?"" ""No, a nuclear war will not break out on the Korean peninsula, as North Korea will not use military weapons first. The Americans have a theory of pre-emptive nuclear strike on North Korea, and Russia too, by the way. North Korea does not have such a theory.""

493,"Antidoping officials from at least 10 nations and 20 athlete groups are preparing the extraordinary step of requesting that the entire Russian delegation be barred from the Summer Olympics over allegations of a   doping program, according to email correspondence obtained by The New York Times. The antidoping officials and athletes were expected to pressure Olympic leaders on the matter as soon as Monday  —   less than three weeks before the opening ceremony in Rio. They were waiting for the results of an investigation into claims published in The Times of a   doping program conducted by Russian officials at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia’s former antidoping lab director, told The Times in May that he followed government orders to cover up the widespread use of   drugs by dozens of Russian Olympians at the Sochi Games. At least 15 of them won medals, he said. Russian officials have dismissed allegations of a   doping program as a Western conspiracy intended to smear Russia. The country’s track and field team has already been barred from the Rio Games for doping violations calls for sanctions against Russian athletes in every sport would be unprecedented and would likely escalate the geopolitical debate. At least 10 national antidoping organizations  —   including those in the United States, Germany, Spain, Japan, Switzerland and Canada  —   and more than 20 athlete groups representing Olympians from around the world have banded together as they anticipate validation of Dr. Rodchenkov’s claims. The chief executive of the Institute of National   Organizations, a trade group to which dozens of nations’ antidoping agencies belong, urged all members to sign on to the request on Friday, according to an email reviewed by The Times. “It seems very likely that the Report will confirm what will be one of the biggest doping scandals in history, implicating the Russian Government in a massive conspiracy against the clean athletes of the world,” wrote Joseph de Pencier, the chief executive of the national antidoping trade association. “This will be a ‘watershed moment’ for clean sport. ” In an interview on Saturday, Travis Tygart, head of the United States   Agency, said: “We’re not asking for the worst, and obviously we hope there’s no doping going on by states. But if we’re not preparing for all potential outcomes, then we’re not fulfilling our promise to clean athletes. ” Reuters first reported on Saturday that United States and Canadian antidoping officials were planning to call for a wider ban of Russian athletes at the Rio Games. Mr. Tygart and other antidoping officials said they had not seen the report, which was commissioned by the World   Agency and prepared by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren. It is expected to be released on Monday morning in Toronto. Mr. McLaren has indicated that his inquiry will prove true what Dr. Rodchenkov told The Times last spring. Last month, Mr. McLaren delivered a preliminary report to global track and field officials as they were scrutinizing Russia he called Dr. Rodchenkov’s detailed account of swapping out   urine at Sochi with the help of Russia’s intelligence service “credible and verifiable,” adding that he had evidence to confirm that “the ministry of sport was involved in instructing the laboratory to not report positive sample results. ” After that report, track and field’s governing body barred Russian athletes from the Games, leaving a “narrow crack in the door” for Russian athletes who had been subjected to rigorous   outside Russia to petition to compete in Rio, but under a neutral flag. So far, two Russian athletes have been given dispensation. One of them, Yuliya Stepanova, fled Russia in 2014 after alleging widespread doping. President Vladimir V. Putin has called her a “Judas” for betraying the country. “If McLaren produces clear, convincing, irrefutable evidence that there has been systemic   doping in Russian sport,” said Paul Melia, Canada’s top antidoping official, “the appropriate sanction would be for the I. O. C. to ban the Russian Olympic Committee from taking a team to Rio. ” Anticipating confirmation of Dr. Rodchenkov’s account, the group of dozens of antidoping officials are considering addressing Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and the organization’s executive board members. They are preparing to request that the ban applied to Russia’s track and field athletes be applied across sports, with opportunities for athletes to appeal and possibly be given permission to compete under a neutral flag. Since Dr. Rodchenkov outlined an elaborate doping scheme at the Sochi Games, the I. O. C. has repeatedly called for “the right balance between collective responsibility and individual justice. ” It is unclear if Mr. Bach would be persuaded by the antidoping organizations’ request to bar the entire Russian delegation. In May Mr. Bach said he would apply a “ ” policy and would not rule out bans against Russia across entire sports, like track and field. But last month he defended the Russian Olympic Committee, distancing the organization from the sports ministry. Dr. Rodchenkov, however, said he took direct orders from Russia’s deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, who is a member of Russia’s Olympic Committee. United States lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate have expressed concern about Dr. Rodhchenkov’s allegations. Last month, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said the scandal called into question the “strength and credibility” of the antidoping system. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce echoed that this month, urging Mr. Bach to seize “crucial and timely opportunities” to clean up global sports. “The failure to do so is simply irresponsible, and we will not remain silent,” the lawmakers wrote. Both the Senate and House committees have United States government jurisdiction over international sports, and the United States has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the World   Agency since the early 2000s. Russia’s sports ministry has admitted to doping problems in recent months but denied government involvement. In an interview with The Times in Moscow this month, Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister, diminished the power of Mr. McLaren’s commission and WADA, which have the ability to make recommendations such as the ones the antidoping officials and athletes are prepared to do. The I. O. C. and sports federations have ultimate authority over who competes at the Games. “Recommendations?” Mr. Mutko said. “It’s about the decisions. With respect to the commission, they do not determine the fate of world sport. ”",0,1068,20.150943396226417,53,0.40168539325842695,0,0,0,0,98.01553795675574,11.103884567367711,71.29325842696629,35.588847274240536,0.7668539325842697,0.018726591760299626,0.03651685393258427,0.012172284644194757,0.018726591760299626,0.023408239700374533,0.17228464419475656,0.0018726591760299626,0.0009363295880149813,0.02247191011235955,0.09363295880149813,0,0.05805243445692884,0.013108614232209739,0.0028089887640449437,0.009363295880149813,0.012172284644194757,0.06741573033707865,0.0009363295880149813,0.052434456928838954,0.02153558052434457,0.04400749063670412,0,0,0.020599250936329586,0.012172284644194757,0.11704119850187265,0,0,0,0.0009363295880149813,0,0.020599250936329586,0.03838951310861423,0,0,0.41198501872659177,0.008426966292134831,0.008426966292134831,0.003745318352059925,0.0028089887640449437,0.026217228464419477,0.0028089887640449437,0.0018726591760299626,0.011235955056179775,0.00749063670411985,0.03464419475655431,0.0149812734082397,0.0056179775280898875,0.006554307116104869,0.008426966292134831,0.006554307116104869,0.0028089887640449437,0,0.015917602996254682,0.1694756554307116,0.0028089887640449437,0,0.010299625468164793,0.06179775280898876,0.10955056179775281,0.024344569288389514,0.012172284644194757,0.0749063670411985,0.15823970037453183,0.05056179775280899,0.016853932584269662,0.0009363295880149813,0.03089887640449438,0.12265917602996254,0.0056179775280898875,0.009363295880149813,0.0056179775280898875,0.0009363295880149813,0.0018726591760299626,0,0,0.008426966292134831,0.08239700374531835,0.07584269662921349,0,0.011235955056179775,0.00749063670411985,0.040262172284644196,0.09925093632958802,0.09644194756554307,0.0056179775280898875,0.06460674157303371,0,22,0,42,0,16,4,10,52.625,15,53,10,6,7,0,22,1,66,17,112.625,191.625,66,,0.4032432399798387,0,0.5633225425108305,0,0.32950529735720224,0.10941624977854181,0.23497542908541055,0.6177901889806526,0.31540672800358227,0.6194654184181996,0.23497542908541055,0.15561117886054343,0.17695696176597023,0,0.2693140767537041,0.029799472325023054,0.05451729478575116,0.014042333505420754,0.0930304594734125,0.15828600929272071,-0.6694499620995833,0.8417139907072793,49

495,"Print [Ed. – Videos are starting to come out, like the one here . Reportedly, it took 40 police officers to gain control of the situation.] An Israeli speaker’s talk at a London college campus scheduled for this week was canceled on Wednesday. Why? Because, according to the cancelation notice sent by the student union, “there had been controversy” when he spoke at the campus two years prior, and the hosting organization failed to disclose that when the room was booked for the talk. After cries of suppression of speech and vehement protests, the university stepped in and “un”canceled the talk. Hen Mazzig’s talk at University College, London, was reinstated. It would take place, as scheduled, on Thursday evening, Oct. 27. The response by the anti-Israel mob was swift and the attack was vicious. A protest was called. Outside the room where Mazzig was scheduled to speak, livid demonstrators screamed for murder and the end of Israel. “Intifada, Intifada!” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” They barred the entrance to the talk while pummeling the doors and windows, leering malevolently. Two thugs yanked open a window, hurling themselves into the room, launching several students inside into panic attacks. A woman inside kept repeating: “This is like the Warsaw Ghetto!”",1,216,12.705882352941176,17,0.35648148148148145,0,0,0,0,98.38163320883909,33.94356261022928,74.16606929510155,1,0.8055555555555556,0.009259259259259259,0.018518518518518517,0.027777777777777776,0.05092592592592592,0.004629629629629629,0.24074074074074073,0.027777777777777776,0.004629629629629629,0.009259259259259259,0.125,0,0.06481481481481481,0,0,0.023148148148148147,0,0.037037037037037035,0.004629629629629629,0.0787037037037037,0.018518518518518517,0.05555555555555555,0.004629629629629629,0.004629629629629629,0,0.004629629629629629,0.06018518518518518,0.013888888888888888,0,0,0.004629629629629629,0,0.004629629629629629,0.06944444444444445,0,0,0.44907407407407407,0,0.023148148148148147,0.027777777777777776,0,0.023148148148148147,0,0,0.009259259259259259,0.018518518518518517,0.009259259259259259,0.004629629629629629,0.004629629629629629,0.018518518518518517,0,0.046296296296296294,0,0,0.023148148148148147,0.19444444444444445,0.013888888888888888,0,0.027777777777777776,0.06481481481481481,0.11574074074074074,0.013888888888888888,0.004629629629629629,0.041666666666666664,0.1527777777777778,0.037037037037037035,0.004629629629629629,0.004629629629629629,0.046296296296296294,0.18518518518518517,0,0.013888888888888888,0.009259259259259259,0.009259259259259259,0.004629629629629629,0,0,0.004629629629629629,0.06481481481481481,0.09259259259259259,0,0,0.009259259259259259,0.07407407407407407,0.13425925925925927,0.12037037037037036,0,0.07407407407407407,0,0,0,45,3,0,0,6,0,0.73,19,3.73,0,0,0,0,0,7.1899999999999995,6,72,79.19,7.1899999999999995,,0,0,0.7093418390763443,0.13993131946754478,0,0,0.2455083338405087,0,0.03808214377077371,0.507490982041442,0.16825229103330042,0,0,0,0.39422993354606783,0,0.026032803504833626,0.021724175386509288,0.26069010463811143,0.28672290814294504,-0.8325154530505862,0.713277091857055,19
496,"ST. PAUL  —   A dashiki. A   trench coat. A sequined slip dress. A velvet blazer. Shirts, scarves and necklaces. Football jerseys, neckties, boas and silk robes. Hair dye and wigs. Nail polish and eye shadow and lipstick. Purple popped up in all sorts of places at the Xcel Energy Center here Thursday night, on Prince loyalists who had come from all over the city and all over the world for “The Official Prince Tribute Concert,” envisioned by his estate as a grand celebration of the legacy of a transformative rock and pop icon, who died April 21 of an accidental overdose of painkillers. Here, just next to Minneapolis, the city he honed his skills in and never strayed far from  —   his residential and recording complex, Paisley Park, is in nearby Chanhassen and is being converted into a museum  —   he is a god, and also a local kid done good. He is so much a part of the area’s fabric that it made utter sense that almost everyone in the   crowd of 17, 000 was keen to show off a little bit of inner Prince. That strong sense of ownership also highlighted the tension that underscored this decidedly uneven concert, and eventually almost undermined it  —   between Prince as a local hero and Prince as a global superstar. Judging by the execution of the concert, hometown Prince was the clear victor, or at least the more achievable inspiration. For almost five hours, the New Power Generation  —   one of Prince’s   backing bands  —   held steady court while several Prince collaborators known best to intimates and committed fans, and a handful of more widely known performers, including Stevie Wonder and Chaka Khan, celebrated Prince with covers of his songs. But when this concert was originally announced in July, it was scheduled for U. S. Bank Stadium, a football arena three times the size of the Xcel Energy Center. It also promised to emphasize Prince’s vast influence in the pop mainstream with performances by more contemporary stars like Christina Aguilera and John Mayer. But both of them withdrew from the downsized show this week under dubious circumstances. What remained was haphazard and inconsistent, a concert that told no coherent story about Prince apart from the fact that he was widely admired and almost impossible to emulate. Some gamely tried: Luke James, whose falsetto on “Do Me, Baby” attracted the first lusty shrieks of the night, and Bilal, the most impressive male singer here not named Stevie, who woke up   of the way through “The Beautiful Ones” and kept putting his limber voice to work through “If I Was Your Girlfriend” (though his performance couldn’t hold a candle to his riveting Prince tribute at the BET Awards in June). A pair of vocally ambitious young female soul singers, Tori Kelly and Jessie J, tried for similar energy. There is something tepid about Ms. Kelly’s brilliance  —   it’s familiar in shape but has no flash. And Jessie J is all pyrotechnics and no depth. Neither fared well here. Ms. Kelly’s “Let’s Get Crazy” was stagnant, and she wilted on “Take Me With U,” a duet with Mr. Wonder. The Portuguese fado singer Ana Moura played a perplexing set, including a version of “Little Red Corvette” that overlooked many of the words. Early in the night came a baffling appearance by Nicole Scherzinger, former lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, though it was less arbitrary than the repeated bits throughout the concert of Doug E. Fresh, the 1980s   beatboxer who had little in common with anyone else onstage. Even Chaka Khan felt unmoored, singing her own “Sweet Thing” and Prince’s “1999” with the same misty approach. Everyone’s set was brief  —   sometimes mercifully, often frustratingly. The show opened with two excellent Minneapolis stalwart bands: Mint Condition, inheritors of the Prince sound, and Morris Day  the Time, Prince collaborators and antagonists (who were to perform a   show at the storied Minneapolis club First Avenue later in the night). Both were gone too soon. Much of the heavy lifting fell to elders: Mr. Wonder, wearing a purple shirt and a purple kerchief in his blazer, who performed a gobsmacking version of Donny Hathaway’s “Someday We’ll All Be Free,” and later was visibly weeping during the “Purple Rain” encore. And the extremely spry André Cymone, a teenage friend and bandmate of Prince’s who was the most visible performer here, with strong versions of “Uptown,” “Controversy” and “The Ladder,” a duet with Cassandra O’Neal. (His guitar playing was much louder and more dexterous than his singing, though.) Mr. Cymone was one of several standouts from Prince’s extended orbit  —   others included Judith Hill (on “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore? ”) Liv Warfield (on “Hot Thing”) and Saeeda Wright (on “7”)  —   performers who reinforced the image of Prince as progenitor of a whole city’s worth of sounds. Even though the gaps between these moments and the rest of the show were large, the concert had a steady consistency throughout  —   onstage, Minneapolis was claiming its son, and in the audience, locals were grieving the loss of a neighbor.",0,857,21.425,40,0.3267211201866978,0,0,0,0,92.81816452976905,12.971788948951808,72.40330610657332,63.378152769051255,0.7852975495915986,0.01866977829638273,0.05484247374562427,0.038506417736289385,0.03617269544924154,0.010501750291715286,0.19603267211201866,0.002333722287047841,0.0011668611435239206,0.019836639439906652,0.09568261376896149,0,0.043173862310385065,0.011668611435239206,0.009334889148191364,0.004667444574095682,0.01633605600933489,0.07584597432905485,0.003500583430571762,0.060676779463243874,0.026837806301050177,0.06651108518086347,0,0.003500583430571762,0.021003500583430573,0.003500583430571762,0.058343057176196034,0,0.002333722287047841,0.005834305717619603,0.005834305717619603,0,0.004667444574095682,0.049008168028004666,0.003500583430571762,0.003500583430571762,0.4329054842473746,0,0.01633605600933489,0.002333722287047841,0.004667444574095682,0.042007001166861145,0.007001166861143524,0.0011668611435239206,0.012835472578763127,0.014002333722287048,0.028004667444574097,0.043173862310385065,0.005834305717619603,0.012835472578763127,0.009334889148191364,0.008168028004667444,0.004667444574095682,0.0011668611435239206,0.015169194865810968,0.18436406067677946,0.012835472578763127,0.007001166861143524,0.049008168028004666,0.051341890315052506,0.06417736289381563,0.03150525087514586,0.028004667444574097,0.030338389731621937,0.1306884480746791,0.073512252042007,0.030338389731621937,0.0011668611435239206,0.039673278879813305,0.12602100350058343,0.003500583430571762,0.010501750291715286,0.0011668611435239206,0.003500583430571762,0.022170361726954493,0,0.002333722287047841,0.01866977829638273,0.08868144690781797,0.07001166861143523,0.0011668611435239206,0.024504084014002333,0.0011668611435239206,0.043173862310385065,0.07701283547257877,0.07817969661610269,0.002333722287047841,0.022170361726954493,0.004667444574095682,82.625,0,18.125,1,9.515625,19,8,11,31.58,16,9,11.75,22,0,82.625,2,154.550625,30,61.875,230.425625,154.550625,,0.7449782968607399,0,0.3905469642769115,0.03414802408943918,0.25173680207227905,0.4018249514846836,0.2204812092115424,0.28001028530497923,0.5275266756268902,0.36130209551358533,0.24138865261078873,0.29349853597609643,0.4375125552030437,0,0.5126281309391147,0.06604088253131131,0.15101304992241132,0.029313317223222744,0.06045871677289691,0.22515131473281216,0.8224993205052114,0.7748486852671879,64
497,"Print version Font Size The hypersonic aircraft , known as ""article 4202"" or ""15U71"" was successfully tested on October 25 for the first time. All avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system of the vehicle are entirely of Russian production.The weapon is capable of speeding up to 15 Max, or 7 km/sec. The vehicle was designed to be installed at prospective intercontinental ballistic missiles, instead of conventional warheads. The ""4202"" vehicle starts working at an altitude of about 100 km and flies to the target at the speed of 5-7 km/s. Before entering dense layers of the atmosphere, directly above the target, the hypersonic aircraft performs a complex maneuver that makes it difficult to interception by missile defense systems of the enemy . Noteworthy, the project of hypersonic warheads called ""Albatross"" appeared in the USSR in the mid-1980s, as a response to USA's attempts to create a missile defense system within the concept of ""star wars."" However, due to the technical difficulties, the project was shut down. In the mid-1990s, the Scientific and Production Association (NPO) resumed the development of the new weapon under the number ""4202.""According to sources at Roscosmos state corporation, the successful tests of the new hypersonic aircraft were made possible with the help of the intensive import substitution program. For instance, Russian engineers had to get rid of the control system, previously manufactured by Ukrainian company Hartron. The successfully implemented program provided an opportunity to resume the tests. As a result, all the avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system now completely consist of Russian components.The Russian Army is to receive new hypersonic weapons by 2020 . The development of high-speed anti-aircraft missiles has made it possible to intercept and destroy any modern aircraft or missile at any altitude. The way out is to create the aircraft capable of flying faster than interceptor missiles.For this particular reason, major powers of the world, such as the USA, Russia and China, rushed to develop hypersonic flight vehicles of different types and purposes. China, for example, tested the hypersonic WU-14 glider on 9 January 2015. The Chinese aircraft is launched into outer space with the help of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Then, the vehicle develops the speed of 10M, that is, more than 12,300 km/h, and dives onto the target. State-of-the-art air defense systems are unable to detect and intercept a target flying at this speed. China has thus become the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, which has the technology of hypersonic vehicles for both nuclear and conventional weapons. In fact, the Chinese have created a warhead with control surfaces that can maneuver in flight thus becoming practically invulnerable. However, this vehicle does not have its own engine, so the Chinese creation has become another weapon for ""the poorest."" Russia currently works on different types of hypersonic scramjet missiles, which can be launched from land, ships or aircraft.Pravda.Ru requested an expert opinion from chief editor of ""Arms Export"" magazine, Andrey Frolov.""How competitive is Russia in the development of hypersonic aircraft?"" ""Russia is at the forefront. This is not the first test, I think that in the near future these systems will be passed into service at the army. The Americans do not have such weapons yet, the Chinese are in the development process.""""Are there any other details available?"" ""This is a secret subject. We know that such weapons have been created - and this is a lot to know already.""

498,"On Jan. 4, 11 years and 26 days after I walked out of an animal shelter in New Jersey with a little white and brown dog attached to the end of a   leash, she died. On this day, an undiagnosed tumor pressed down on Emily’s brain and told her that she needed to escape, which made her usually soft, cuddly and often napping body go wild, endangering herself and me. The humane thing to do was put her down. I don’t think anything could have prepared me for that moment, or the searing grief that followed. But if I could go back in time to console myself, I would tell myself these six things: Most people will say the wrong thing. They will talk about dogs they knew and loved and put down, too, or, if they haven’t walked through this long, lonely tunnel yet, about how they can’t possibly imagine losing their very alive pet, which reminds you that yours is dead. They will also ask how old she was, and when you say 15, they will say, “Well, it was a good long life,” as if the ending of it would be less painful because of how long you were together. They may tell you other dog death stories, too, like the one about the dog who was so excited to be home from vacation that he bolted out of the car and was immediately run over while the whole family watched  —   stories that imply it could have been worse. They will shove shelter listings for other Jack Russell terriers at you, as if another dog could slip into that perfect little spot left by your beloved     pet. Guilt overwhelms. I still tell myself that I killed Emily, despite the veterinarian telling me, after her body had been taken away, while I gripped both a counter and a vet tech to keep from collapsing, that all four of her paws had been bloodied as she had clawed at the floor, the door and the ground during her manic and desperate attempt to get away from my home. There is guilt, too, over the relief of no longer having to take care of a dog who was on multiple medications and who had arthritis, two defective heart valves and pulmonary hypertension. You will become unmoored. I adopted Emily soon after I became a freelance writer, and I wrote three books with her by my side. She was the metronome to my life. With her gone, I floated through a space she no longer occupied but haunted with every little white hair found on my blankets, on the floor, in my shoes. Once, in the first week following her death, I came up from the basement and looked at the spot where she would usually be waiting. I called for her with the foolish notion that she’d appear at the top of the stairs. But of course, no: just another sledgehammer reminder that she was really gone. Grief is exhausting. Last fall, I ran two marathons and an ultramarathon. After Emily died, I couldn’t drag myself through three miles, not to mention find the energy to get out of bed, put on clothes that were not my pajamas and shower at regular intervals. I pushed off assignments because the idea of putting my fingers to the keyboard was inconceivable when Emily wasn’t sleeping on her bed in the corner of my office. These were wretched,   days, surrounded by a deafening silence. I went back into therapy after she died and was told I was depressed, which wasn’t surprising, as I had started to slip into bed at 8:30 p. m. and not get up until half a day later. Losing a companion and your routine all at once, especially if you’re single like me, could throw anyone into a tailspin. It will get better. You won’t want to hear it, or believe it, because the pain is so suffocating. It does ease, though, almost without you noticing it. But still, it slaps back. This may happen at predictable moments, such as when you decide to sell her crate, and sometimes not. Soon after Emily died, I got on a plane and went to Florida to bake out the pain with   poolside sessions punctuated by midday drinks. It worked, somewhat, but on my last night there, my face cracked open at the World of Disney store when I saw a mug with the character Stitch that said “brave” on one side and “loyal” on the other. Only the cashier noticed that I paid with tears and snot running down my face. I then ran out of the store to stare at a lake. These days, I get up, I brush my teeth, I write, I run. I smile now and laugh sometimes. The pain still catches me, though, and I can now more clearly see why: I loved that dog, and in giving a scared, abused, imperfect Emily a home, she loved me back, and together our lives both bloomed. The loss of that joy is why the pain is so acute  —   and why, at some point in the maybe not so distant future, I’ll go back to that animal shelter with a   leash, and do it all over again.",0,890,21.19047619047619,42,0.21123595505617979,0,0,0,0,55.56353130016051,76.22676200204289,47.752808988764045,16.173033707865166,0.895505617977528,0.007865168539325843,0.04044943820224719,0.06179775280898876,0.051685393258426963,0.011235955056179775,0.15393258426966291,0.0022471910112359553,0.0056179775280898875,0.012359550561797753,0.0651685393258427,0,0.07303370786516854,0.035955056179775284,0.012359550561797753,0.012359550561797753,0.007865168539325843,0.09775280898876404,0.0044943820224719105,0.08089887640449438,0.024719101123595506,0.07865168539325842,0,0.012359550561797753,0.033707865168539325,0.017977528089887642,0.046067415730337076,0,0.0011235955056179776,0.011235955056179775,0.02696629213483146,0,0.019101123595505618,0.06629213483146068,0.0022471910112359553,0.0022471910112359553,0.5752808988764045,0.017977528089887642,0.008988764044943821,0.01348314606741573,0.05955056179775281,0.056179775280898875,0.0011235955056179776,0.0022471910112359553,0.01348314606741573,0.019101123595505618,0.007865168539325843,0.0011235955056179776,0.0044943820224719105,0.03258426966292135,0.017977528089887642,0.029213483146067417,0,0.0011235955056179776,0.019101123595505618,0.25842696629213485,0.0022471910112359553,0,0.030337078651685393,0.04719101123595506,0.04719101123595506,0.11348314606741573,0.02247191011235955,0.012359550561797753,0.14606741573033707,0.1696629213483146,0.017977528089887642,0,0.006741573033707865,0.19213483146067414,0,0.01348314606741573,0.006741573033707865,0.010112359550561797,0.010112359550561797,0,0,0.028089887640449437,0.0898876404494382,0.09775280898876404,0,0.02696629213483146,0.010112359550561797,0.06741573033707865,0.15280898876404495,0.1662921348314607,0.0011235955056179776,0.011235955056179775,0.014606741573033709,20,7,60,14,8,0,0,59,26.4,67,30.5,14,52,43,20,0,150.9,0,231,377.9,150.9,,0.4083069769263126,0.19453764152547678,0.674287967556981,0.32571203244301905,0.2163170463131843,0,0,0.6705859689320887,0.47668269154643705,0.6980420707072116,0.5127536673955041,0.32571203244301905,0.6421120270366407,0.5973653120195325,0.7522476379882183,0,0.1264984491575153,0,0.19364573727890014,0.31679101349652106,-0.7962709347204678,0.6832089865034789,75
499,"Soon 15 NATO Nations Which Do Not Border Russia Will Have Troops on the Russian Border Why does Luxembourg need to have troops stationed a hundred miles from Russia's second city? From the news : More Nato members have pledged to contribute to four battalions stationed in Poland and the Baltic states as the military alliance continues to build its presence on its eastern flank, Nato's secretary general said on October 26. Albania , Italy , Poland and Slovenia will contribute to the Canada -led battalion in Latvia. Belgium , Croatia , France , Luxembourg , Netherlands and Norway will contribute to Germany -led battalion in Lithuania. Denmark and France will strengthen the UK -led battalion in Estonia, while Romania and the UK will add weight to the US -led battalion in Poland. In other words very soon 15 NATO nations (bolded) which do not share a border with Russia will have troops stationed abroad, on the Russian border. Additionally Poland and Norway which share a short border with Russia will also station troops abroad in Lithuania and Latvia. In total a coalition of 20 NATO nations will be parked in the Baltics in a way that encircles the Russian Kaliningrad exclave and puts a portion of the NATO troops just 100 miles from Saint Petersburg -- Russia's second city and historic capital. -- A city where some 1 million civilians were starved to death during the WWII siege put up by Germany which is now returned to the region. Of the 20 NATO nations now on Russia's vulnerable northwestern flank Germany, Italy amd Romania famously invaded it in the 1940s causing 25 million deaths , including 15 million deaths of civilians and prisoners of war . The Russians will also remember that with the German invaders came quisling troops from a number of other nations now again on its borders. The French came with SS Charlemagne, the Danish and Norwegians with SS Viking and Nordland, the Dutch with SS Nederland, the Croats with the 369th Regiment, the Belgians with SS Wallonien and Flandern. In the alternate reality inhabited by western functionaries Russia is about to invade the Baltics neccesitating the build-up there, which is to include a permanent presence of 4,000 troops backed up by a 'rapid reaction force' of 40,000 . On the other hand, c ombined NATO militaries are about 4 times the size the Russian military. Even without counting the US and Canada, the European NATO countries alone have 3 times the population of Russia and 10 times its GDP. Additionally Russia did not do anything to grab the Baltic countries whether before they joined NATO in 2004 or since. -- This despite the long-standing mistreatment of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia actually being worse in the 1990s than today. -- And certainly there are no Russian troops of the border of Albania, UK, Canada or Germany. So really, is this a defensive deployment, or a move to intimidate and dominate Russia by a far richer, and more powerful bloc?

500,"Chairman Of The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, Says He Will Vote For TRUMP. by IWB · October 27, 2016 Tweet by Pamela Williams Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, tweeted Wednesday night he will vote for Donald Trump for President. He went on to say, “Hillary IS that bad”, and he should know. He has worked on the Benghazi Committee, as well as the investigation into her use of a private email server and the deletion of more than 30,000 emails from that account. Chaffetz is the Representative from Utah, and he is as reputable as anyone you will find in today’s corrupt government. He did find confusion as to whom he would vote for, as he was disappointed with Trump when the widely distributed “sex tape” came out. It threw him, but he simply cannot vote for Hillary, as he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt she is bad to the bone and will lead this Country into further destruction. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA. — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 27, 2016 Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz, who hails from the newly-minted toss-up state of Utah, seemingly has had a change of heart: He now says he will indeed vote for Donald Trump . “I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump, but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA,” Chaffetz tweeted Wednesday night.",1,259,19.923076923076923,13,0.25868725868725867,0,0,0,0,76.55235755235755,2.5687950543441858,73.15868725868727,1,0.7837837837837838,0.007722007722007722,0.03861003861003861,0.023166023166023165,0.04633204633204633,0.011583011583011582,0.1891891891891892,0.003861003861003861,0.003861003861003861,0.003861003861003861,0.05791505791505792,0.003861003861003861,0.09652509652509653,0.011583011583011582,0.007722007722007722,0.011583011583011582,0.003861003861003861,0.0888030888030888,0.003861003861003861,0.07335907335907337,0.03861003861003861,0.07335907335907337,0.007722007722007722,0,0.03474903474903475,0.007722007722007722,0.0888030888030888,0,0,0,0.007722007722007722,0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.5096525096525096,0,0.011583011583011582,0.007722007722007722,0.015444015444015444,0.03474903474903475,0.007722007722007722,0,0.019305019305019305,0.011583011583011582,0,0.06177606177606178,0.007722007722007722,0.019305019305019305,0.011583011583011582,0.04247104247104247,0,0.003861003861003861,0.019305019305019305,0.2277992277992278,0.019305019305019305,0.003861003861003861,0.019305019305019305,0.05405405405405406,0.06177606177606178,0.0888030888030888,0.003861003861003861,0.03861003861003861,0.16216216216216217,0.12355212355212356,0.003861003861003861,0,0.023166023166023165,0.10038610038610038,0,0,0.03474903474903475,0.003861003861003861,0.003861003861003861,0,0.003861003861003861,0.0694980694980695,0.11969111969111969,0.04247104247104247,0,0.023166023166023165,0,0.03861003861003861,0.14285714285714285,0.1583011583011583,0,0.05019305019305019,0.003861003861003861,1,0,8,2,0,6,0,46,1.83,8,0,0,1,0,1,0,5.66,6,72,81.66,5.66,,0.05839581272817413,0,0.3316128774121265,0.11034777731716484,0,0.2711923793731366,0,0.7404484305800288,0.10192422069795413,0.3316128774121265,0,0,0.05839581272817413,0,0.23669181907653403,0,0.017541684745552597,0.018595425525320772,0.2231451063038493,0.2530837413996157,-0.85333808889647,0.7469162586003844,18
