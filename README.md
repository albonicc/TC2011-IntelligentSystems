## What I did in this course?
The whole course was oriented into the final proyect, which was a competition among the students enrolled in Kaggle. The competition consisted in creating a model capable of detecting Fake News. In order to acheive this, a training dataset of 500 news in English and Spanish was provided, each news in the dataset had an ID and a class, where the possible classes were: 1 - Fake News, 0 - Not Fake News. 

### Extracting features from Dataset
I used different APIs for extracting different features from the training news dataset. In the first stage of the course. I extracted 10 features using [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) and [ParallelDots](https://www.paralleldots.com/) APIs, 5 for sentiment analysis and 5 for emotions.
