372,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump is broadening the field of candidates for secretary of state as his transition team remains divided nearly a month after the election over how to fill the most prominent gap in his prospective cabinet. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters on Sunday that the search had expanded beyond the four men thought to be under consideration and that Mr. Trump planned to interview additional candidates early this week. Those new candidates appeared to include John R. Bolton, an ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush Jon M. Huntsman Jr. the former Utah governor and ambassador to China under President Obama Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia. Asked about the search on the ABC program “This Week,” Vice   Mike Pence mentioned Mr. Bolton as a potential candidate and said others could be added to the list. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump for about an hour on Friday, and Mr. Tillerson is set to meet with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the meetings. Despite their differences over the Iraq war, which Mr. Bolton ardently supported, Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he turned to Mr. Bolton for military advice and called him “a tough cookie. ” The transition team had previously signaled that the group under consideration had narrowed to four men: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a close ally of Mr. Trump Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and David H. Petraeus, the retired general and director of the C. I. A. under President Obama. Some of those candidates may be brought back in for further interviews, the people briefed on the meetings said. An announcement of a selection for the post is not expected for at least several more days. In an audition of sorts, Mr. Petraeus appeared on “This Week” to highlight his foreign policy experience in the military and his work abroad in the private sector. He also sought to put behind him a potentially significant hurdle to his candidacy: his mishandling of classified material while he was a top general. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2015 and was forced to resign as C. I. A. director. “Five years ago, I made a serious mistake,” Mr. Petraeus said. “I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I paid a very heavy price for it, and I’ve learned from it. ” But he added that it was up to others to “determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not. ” The wrangling over who should be America’s top diplomat comes as Mr. Trump’s team continues to face questions about his   phone conversation with the president of Taiwan last week, which angered China and rattled other Asian nations. Mr. Bolton advocates closer ties with Taiwan as a means of putting pressure on China, arguing that Beijing’s growing power in the region should be checked. Mr. Trump’s advisers are battling, at times publicly, over whether he should choose from among his campaign loyalists or go outside that circle, a move that could alienate voters who were angry at the Republican establishment. Much of that wrangling has centered on Mr. Romney, who was among Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics during the campaign. Mr. Trump has told aides that he believes that Mr. Romney would “look the part” as the face of American outreach to the world and would make a fine secretary of state. But Ms. Conway, who has been openly critical of Mr. Romney, continued to attack him during a “Fox News Sunday” appearance, saying that the backlash to his candidacy among Mr. Trump’s core supporters had been “breathtaking. ” Asked if her criticism of him was appropriate, she said, “I would turn the question around and ask, was it appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump, and never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly. ” Ms. Conway, answering questions from reporters about the expanded search as she entered Trump Tower in New York on Sunday, said the transition team had been happily surprised by the number of wealthy businesspeople who had come forward to express interest. Mr. Trump, who was lifted to victory in the election in large part by the support of white   voters, has faced criticism over his appointment of several   people to top posts. “There are a number of people that we may not have thought wanted to leave their very lucrative private industry positions to go and serve the government,” Ms. Conway said. “It’s exciting, frankly, to at least get their counsel. ” Another person who will meet this week with Mr. Trump is James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral whose name was floated as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. It was unclear if he was being considered for a specific position. Despite the very public    over the secretary of state appointment, Mr. Trump remains well ahead of the pace set by most of his predecessors in naming members of his cabinet. In addition to meetings this week, he is scheduled to travel at least twice, to Fayetteville, N. C. and to Des Moines, on his “thank you” tour. Mr. Petraeus spoke on the ABC program from the sideline of a conference in Germany, greeting the host, George Stephanopoulos, with a “guten tag” before beginning the interview. The retired general praised Mr. Trump as “actually quite pragmatic. ” He appeared careful not to contradict Mr. Trump on a range of his foreign policy priorities, including building a border wall between the United States and Mexico, potentially working with Russia to defeat the Islamic State, and discarding the Iran nuclear accord. “In our conversation, what I enjoyed, most frankly, was the discussion of issues, or, say, campaign rhetoric, if you will, and then placing that in a strategic context,” Mr. Petraeus said. Before he appeared on the show, Mr. Petraeus seemed to get a lift from Mr. Pence, who dismissed concerns about Mr. Petraeus’s mishandling of classified material, in which he gave secret materials to a biographer with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Pence called Mr. Petraeus an “American hero” and said Mr. Trump would consider him based on “the totality” of his career. “Look, he made mistakes, and he paid the consequences for those mistakes,” Mr. Pence said.",0
373,"0 427 “That’s going to be you,” the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator’s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU’s national office reports they’ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families — especially those living in low-income neighborhoods — that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed “Excellence Academy.” The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family’s new set of troubles began. According to the complaints, an “Academy of Excellence” teacher named Faye Myles began “singling out” the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for “disfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.” ‘Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him — “All you Muslims think you are so smart” — in front of the entire class.’ Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. ‘I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn’t be given visas. They’ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You’re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.’ Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his “Academy of Excellence” teacher would also would tell him to “shut up” and punish him during class “downtime” when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. The bus rides home added to the child’s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher’s example and pile on the insults. ‘On the bus ride home, A.A.’s classmates took up his teacher’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a “terrorist,” and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.’ The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill “with a stomach ache” and had no desire to return to the “Academy of Excellence.” In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus’ emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. And then Brenda Nelson, an “Academy of Excellence” board member, printed out two “voluntary” withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: ‘Get your kids out of here. I don’t want them here.’ When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. ‘In spite of some teachers’ valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate’s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate’s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.’ And, sadly, it’s not just the kids. ‘A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words “Build the wall higher” last week, alluding to Trump’s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.’ And in case you assume the “Academy of Excellence” teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you’re wrong. Apparently, she’s a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8 — John Q Archibald (@JohnQarchibald) October 30, 2016 Featured image: Lynn Koenig via Getty Images . Share this Article! ",1
374,"It is all about the price. Millions of people buying insurance in the marketplaces created by the federal health care law have one feature in mind. It is not finding a favorite doctor, or even a trusted company. It is how much  —   or, more precisely, how little  —   they can pay in premiums each month. And for many of them, especially those who are healthy, all the prices are too high. The unexpected laser focus on price has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among the country’s top insurers, as fewer healthy people than expected have signed up. And that has created two vexing questions: Will the major insurance companies stay in the marketplaces? And if they do, will the public have a wide array of plans to choose from  —   a central tenet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act? “The marketplace has been and continues to be unsustainable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers. Most Americans with health insurance get it through their employers or from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The marketplaces were created under the health care law to give the millions of people not covered in those ways a way to buy health plans. While major insurers continue to make profits over all, they say that the economics of the marketplaces do not work for them. Insurers can offer marketplace plans at four different coverage tiers, and the government subsidizes the premiums for millions of people. The thinking was that enough healthy people would buy insurance to balance out the costs for the   . But things are not going exactly as envisioned. People shopping in the marketplaces are overwhelmingly choosing the cheapest plans they can find, according to a federal analysis. In 2014,   of people went for the   or    plans in each of the tiers. In 2015, about half chose the cheapest plans. The pricing pressure is playing out on multiple fronts. People with expensive medical conditions, knowing that they need reliable coverage, seem willing to pay a little more for plans offered by the large companies. Those plans tend to have a wider choice of doctors and a stronger brand name, and the insurers say the people signing up are sicker than they expected. Healthy and young people  —   who are essential to insurers to offset the costs of care for unhealthy people  —   are regularly turning to whatever plan is cheapest, including those from   insurers or with the smallest networks of hospitals and doctors. Many other young and healthy people, particularly those not eligible for generous subsidies, are shunning plans altogether, finding all of the prices too high. That decision puts them at risk of tax penalties. By some estimates, about 10 million people are signed up, fewer than half of the 21 million expected by now. All of this has the major insurance companies, as they finish their third year of selling individual policies under the law, reevaluating their role in the marketplace. The top insurers have essentially stopped talking about expanding their marketplace ambitions. Two companies, UnitedHealth Group and Humana, have said they plan to largely exit the marketplaces. Aetna has halted plans to enter more states. Even insurers that insist they are committed, like Anthem, which offers   Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states, are struggling to find their way. Mr. Swedish describes the market as “not predictable and not reliable. ” If the major insurers keep cutting back, it could lead to a cascade of effects for the people who depend on the marketplaces for coverage. People could potentially face higher premiums because there are fewer insurers competing, and they could have more limited choices of plans and doctors. The apprehension is not lost on regulators and lawmakers. On Thursday, the Obama administration said it was exploring ways to protect insurers from very expensive medical claims. And recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, President Obama wrote that more financial assistance for people may be needed. So the mainstream insurers are struggling to find a business model for the marketplaces that works. If an insurer is successful at being the cheapest in a market, it has often found that it priced its plans too low to cover its medical costs. Some smaller insurers have already gone out of business. But if an insurer prices a plan too high, it might not attract enough healthy people to break even. Companies both large and small now plan to raise prices sharply for 2017, which could prevent even more people from buying policies. “The price competition has turned out to be much more cutthroat than anyone expected,” said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the law. Still, most experts say there is no immediate danger that the market will collapse. Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that the Obama administration was confident that the marketplaces would “continue to thrive for years ahead. ” The department said on Thursday that the people entering the marketplaces are becoming more mixed over time, and the marketplaces are attracting more young and healthy people over all. The major insurers, though, say the healthy people are going to other plans, often the least expensive ones offered by their smaller competitors. Some defenders of the law say it is working as intended, harnessing competition to keep premiums as low as possible. “We have to be realistic,” said Linda J. Blumberg, a health care expert at the Urban Institute, noting that some large companies may not be nimble enough to succeed. “You can’t lower costs without breaking some eggs. ” Not every insurance company is struggling. The exceptions seem to be those that offer the most limited choice of doctors and hospitals and may pay them the least, including plans offered by companies like Molina and Centene, which previously specialized in covering   Medicaid patients. The insurers faring the worst sell plans that resemble those traditionally offered through employers. The plans give customers much greater latitude over where to get care and cover some of the   doctors and   hospitals. The trouble is that people signing up for those plans are less healthy  —   and more expensive to treat  —   than anticipated. The companies also say that the provisions of the law aimed at stabilizing the market and protecting them from heavy losses are not working. Several say that consolidation is the answer. Anthem, for example, says the only way it can expand in the marketplaces is by merging with Cigna, a deal the Justice Department is trying to block. Another remedy is to attract a broader range of customers. “We have to get a healthier pool of people in the market,” said Kurt Kossen, an executive at Health Care Service Corporation, which operates nonprofit Blue Cross plans in several states but lost $1. 5 billion last year. The result could be a market essentially left to insurers that offer the same narrow networks found in Medicaid plans and some remaining Blue Cross plans, said Mr. Levitt, of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The market is sustainable but with a different mix of plans,” he said.",0

It’s about bringing people closer together. You know, when I was coming up, people loved and respected the police, the deputies. And, I want to be the one to bring that back, especially in the community I serve. ” The   NBA   said he is a perfect fit for the job because he can relate to anyone. “I’m a guy that speaks all languages. I can throw on a suit and have a conversation with Bill Gates, I can go in the hood and talk to the homies, and talk to the children,” Shaq explained. He said he is unsure yet where he would run. He could run for Sheriff in Henry County, GA, where he is a resident and where the incumbent is up for reelection in 2020. Another option for Shaq is in Florida where he also has residency. He could also establish new residency somewhere else and run in that location. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0

377,"Email Hafnarfjorður, Iceland. The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Iceland’s Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. Now it´s all about coalition building. Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats, now down to 8). This coalition is the same center-right configuration which led Iceland to financial disaster, the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals, and whose members were implicated in off-shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last PM from the Progressive Party, causing these early elections, and now to the formal resignation of their present PM just a few hours ago. Technically these two parties could form a 3-party coalition along with the new Regeneration Party. However, Regeneration leader Benedikt Jóhanesson has said he wouldn´t consider a coalition with the governing parties. Thus that particular scenario is doubted. After years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy, and controversy over the Panama Papers leaking of wealthy Icelanders´ involvement in Tortola, this new development reflects a growing, widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following Iceland’s independence. The ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable. The other numbers however, are pointing to a change of course: The Pirates won 14.5% giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat Parliament, the Althing. The Left-Greens received 15.9% (for 10 Seats); the Social Democrats 5.7% (3 seats) and Bright Future 7.2% (winning 4 seats).Together they represent almost 30% of the electorate. These are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week, just before the election. If a four party coalition is solidified, then Iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable Pirate Party within its government (Germany is the first) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the country´s governance. The kingmakers could very well be Regeneration, a new, center-right grouping who won 10.5% of the votes getting them 7 seats. They characterize themselves as “liberal”, though the head was a long-time supporter of the Independence Party before leaving this past year. On the 18th of October he said he wouldn’t consider joining a coalition with the two-headed ruling hydra of the Independence and Progressive parties. Were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left, center-left groups of which the Pirates are a part (something he declared he was open to the morning after the election), then that would net a total of 34 seats (27 + their 7) and a solid majority. A five party coalition. What does this all mean? It means several things: in the short run, the helm of the Icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the Independence Party as the largest single grouping in the Althingi (Parliament). But aside from that approximately 30% of the electorate who aren´t swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class, the rest of the country is moving on. They are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics (with the Pirates) and considering broad coalition politics (5 groups trying to control the direction of the country). This may be the wave of the future. Or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources (and actually and clearly defining such) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new, dominant ideology. In the long run, things are changing. And then there is this issue of a new Constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved. If that was now formally accepted, then some serious changes may be in store for the Owners of the country. But today is only the day after, and nothing has been decided yet. So what´s next? Well, the new President’s job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and, if they fail in securing a stable majority, the next leading party would get a shot. This was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups. Now, however, a new multi-party dynamic is at play. Who knows how the discussions are heading right now, and which horses are being traded? Iceland has always been the most USAmerican of the Nordic countries but with tugs in both directions. Much like the island itself, rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the European and American tectonic plates, these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow. With history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties´ corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric, it appears Iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the Pirates. But they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and Iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness. In the long run, that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider, just like its geographical counterpart. But it is the Pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people (and, in particular the young). If they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring Edward Snowden here (a publicity stunt at best) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy, then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road.

378,"In a   conference room at Stanford University, a score of scholars, many of them eminent and some from as far away as Johannesburg and Beijing, gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality. The gathering itself had no overt hierarchy, though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others. When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert  —   except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse. Mr. Berggruen, 54, is an investor and art collector who was once known as the “homeless billionaire” because he lived in itinerant luxury in   hotels. Now he is grounded in Los Angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank, the Berggruen Institute. The institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by Bill Gates and George Soros. Sean Parker, one of the entrepreneurs behind Napster and Facebook, has a research institute, The Parker Foundation, which this month pledged $250 million for cancer immunotherapy. He is also a   of the Economic Innovation Group, which labels itself an “ideas laboratory. ” Tom Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager in California, has several environmental nonprofit groups, and last year created the Fair Shake Commission to redress economic inequality. “There is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are ” said James G. McGann, the director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania  —   a think tank that thinks about think tanks. In a   culture where tweets, not position papers, shape the national conversation, these kinds of   “are likely to be more influential than we are,” Mr. McGann said. Mr. Berggruen stands out because he is a   but   player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious  —   a Gatsby who shows up at his own parties. “I am a person who likes to engage in learning,” Mr. Berggruen said, in an accent reflecting his Parisian upbringing and dual German and American citizenship. The next step was “to see if I can produce some ideas,” he said. Mr. Berggruen’s investment company, Berggruen Holdings, is registered in the British Virgin Islands and his charitable trust is based in Bermuda. The institute bankrolls several conferences a year, and Mr. Berggruen attends almost every session, takes careful notes and sometimes even appears to dress the part. At a dinner for philosophy scholars at the Stanford Park Hotel in March, he wore a dark blazer and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to his sternum, the signature look of the French celebrity philosopher   Lévy. There are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor. “One of the delights of philanthropy is that it isn’t programmed, it is scattershot, with so much room for idiosyncratic choices,” said Karl Zinsmeister, author of “The Almanac of American Philanthropy. ” He cited the example of Daniel Guggenheim, who championed the rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot. “Of course there is a high percentage of waste,” Mr. Zinsmeister said, “but that’s how discovery works. ” Others worry, though, that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects. Mr. Berggruen’s institute “seems like a   of his creation,” McGann said, referring to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland  —   the Ascot of conferences for the global elite. Mr. McGann publishes an annual report on the world’s top think tanks, ranking them in more than 50 categories. The Berggruen Institute is not included in any of them. Mr. Berggruen happens to be a Davos habitué, but his institute has a more eclectic mandate. Besides philosophy, he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the California budget. He has established councils to study European integration and China. The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the   academic year. Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif. and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog  de Meuron to design his institute’s headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to “deepen the conversation. ” Mr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. “He knows everyone,” said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a   of LinkedIn. Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen’s interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. “I said, ‘Yeah, that’s interesting. Let me meet him,’” Mr. Hoffman recalled. The luminaries listed on the institute’s advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller’s yacht: Arianna Huffington,   of The Huffington Post the SpaceX founder Elon Musk Tony Blair, the former British prime minister Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. “I’m not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,” Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state’s budget crisis. Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of   questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer. Last November, Mr. Berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in Beijing to discuss the future of China. Upon the group’s arrival in Beijing, the roads were cleared for their motorcade to the Great Hall of the People for a meeting with President Xi Jinping. Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was “astute. ” It also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. “In some ways he is a thinking man’s Donald Trump,” Mr. Schell said. “He doesn’t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence. ” While Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn’t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris. The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1. 5 billion. Last year, Town  Country magazine named him one of the world’s 50 most eligible bachelors. And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: “Me. I am the mother and the father. ” Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors. Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies. Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his   charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life’s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy. Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. “It was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,” Mr. Walker said. “I found him a little mysterious. He didn’t invite personal confidences. ” Mr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn’t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. with little time for small talk. At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. “I am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,” he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. “The West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is  —   and I don’t mean this in a negative way  —   conformist. ” Mr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California’s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012. Think Long was on the winning side, though, of a 2014 measure to make ballot initiatives more transparent. Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, which supported the measure, said that she didn’t recall the Berggruen Institute’s adding much to policy ideas, but that it did help finance legal advisers and recruit experts. “I wouldn’t say it was deep thinking,” Ms. Feng said, “but he did bring in some very   individuals. ” In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge  —   which has become a kind of social register for   philanthropists  —   joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100, 000, the minimum annual gift required many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U. C. L. A. $4, 750. Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is “not just a   operation it’s an ideas and   operation. ” Several scholars say that Mr. Berggruen’s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study. “I can’t say whether it’s the best use of his money,” Professor Appiah said. “I can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better. ”",0
379,"It happened so fast: One moment I was running trails, the next I was staring a   sow in the face, so close I could smell it, wild and pungent and alarming, and I knew it could smell me, too, my fear. I was in the middle of a rainy   run in Far North Bicentennial Park on the outskirts of Anchorage, where I live. It was late July, a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the   salmon swimming up Campbell Creek. But I was miles from the water. I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadn’t seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting. I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips. Then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me. It’s impossible to run the trails around Alaska without thinking about bears. There are piles of scat everywhere, dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun, reminders that you have to be careful. You have to be versed in bear awareness, bear etiquette and bear protocol. Headphones are a   and going alone is discouraged. Making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended. Still, I often ran alone. I preferred it that way. I liked the serenity and the loneliness, liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees. That day, I wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack, and I sang, too, whenever I came to dense areas. I sang old rock ’n’ roll songs, loudly and badly. I was cautious but not afraid. I ran these trails all summer and the summer before, and while I saw bears on many other trails, I only twice saw them on these sections. Maybe I let down my guard. Maybe I felt invincible, the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results. Maybe the bear was having a bad day. When the bear charged, time stood still. I felt every millisecond. I stood in the drizzle, rain coating my face like tears, and I did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges: I waved my arms and yelled. “I’m human!” I cried, my voice rising through the birch trees, through that silent and   moment. “I’m a person!” The bear paused and ran back toward the brush. A minute later, it charged a second time. And again I waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped, this time so close I could almost reach out and touch its snout. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t swallow. I wondered, briefly and almost idly, if this was how I would die. Suddenly, I wanted to talk to my son, who was grown and off living his own life. I wanted to hear his voice. A lifetime later, the bear turned and ran off, its backside swaying into the trees. I had to get back to the trail, to the possibility of safety, yet I couldn’t step away from the alders. It was my only protection. That’s when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc. That’s when I knew I was in trouble, became really afraid. When my son was young and nothing would comfort him, I would talk. It didn’t matter what I said, he needed my voice, the steady flow of words. As I stepped from the shelter of the alders, I talked out loud, my voice surprisingly calm. I talked to the bear to show that I meant no harm, but mostly I talked to reassure myself. As the bear circled for a second time, I stumbled through devil’s club, snagging my shorts and scratching my legs, and I talked about the day my son was born, how I recognized his face immediately. When I reached the trail, I kept talking. The bear followed, but I didn’t look back. A half a mile later, I glanced over my shoulder, and the bear was gone. I started running and didn’t stop until I encountered two hikers, and I collapsed at their feet. For weeks I saw that bear’s face in my dreams, and I woke up, heart pounding. I swore I would never run trails again, but I missed it too much, and soon I was out with the trees and that big, big sky. Some things are worth the risk, though I made sure to carry a canister of bear spray, just in case. And sometimes even now when I’m running, I think of that bear charging and how I stood there, so still and yet so alive. It opened something inside of me that can never be closed. It offered a taste of the unknown: At any time I might find myself crouched in the brush, face to face with my own fragile existence. So much of life is chance. There are no guarantees. But there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck.",0

Pese a lo impresionante de la calidad de imagen, Carrasco lamenta que el guión de su vida no estuviera a la altura. “Además, con tanta definición en la imagen he comprobado que llevo treinta años con un trozo de lechuga entre los dientes y nadie jamás me ha avisado”, lamenta. “Los mejores momentos de mi vida, mi primer ordenador, mi primera novia online… todos los momentos memorables en la existencia de un informático se vieron empañados por un simple trozo de lechuga.

381,"Thursday night’s Congressional Baseball Game took on added meaning and importance after the shooting at the Republican practice on Wednesday, which left Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise seriously wounded. [The Democrats would go on to win the game, convincingly, by a final  . Though, the postgame scene became one of unity and camaraderie as the Democrats presented the trophy to Scalise, who is still in critical condition after the attack. Representative Joe Barton of Texas accepted the trophy on Scalise’s behalf.  According to ESPN: A huge ovation came from the crowd, which swelled to a record 24, 959, when Special Agent David Bailey, one of the Capitol Police officers injured in the attack on Republicans at their ball practice in Virginia, threw out the first pitch. “ONE FAMILY,” proclaimed a sign in the crowd. The announcer’s mention of Scalise, the House majority whip who was critically wounded in the attack Wednesday, brought the masses to their feet.

The    said, “By playing tonight we are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence or assaults on our democracy. The game will go on. ” ESPN reported, “When the president intoned three words he said have brought Americans together for generations —  ”Let’s play ball” —  cheers rang out. ” While the game provides some relief and bipartisanship in a town dominated by faction and division, the other more important aspect of the game has to do with how it benefits various charities. This year, the charities are the “Boys  Girls Club of Greater Washington, Washington Literacy Center, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and, after Wednesday’s shooting, the Capitol Police Memorial Fund. ” After Thursday’s result, the   record in the game is 39 wins each, for both Democrats and Republicans, with one tie.

382,"The strict French gun control that makes it extremely difficult for   citizens to defend themselves has proven little more than a paper tiger when it comes to prohibiting terrorists and public attackers from acquiring the guns they need to kill innocents. [The April 20 attack on a police patrol on the Champs Élysées illustrates this perfectly in light of the fact that the alleged attacker —  Karim Cheurfi —  was previously jailed for shooting at officers with a . 38 Special revolver. The Daily Mail reports that Cheurfi was imprisoned “in 2005 for trying to kill two policemen” and wounding a third person with the revolver.  On Thursday he allegedly used a Kalashnikov to kill two officers. He was then shot dead, and upon searching his car, police discovered more weapons, “including a pump action shotgun. ” The University of Sydney’s GunPolicy. org describes French gun laws as “restrictive,” yet they were powerless to stop Cheurfi, just as they offered no hindrance to the    who entered the Alexis de Tocqueville high school in Grasse   and opened fire. Despite universal background checks —  “which [consider] criminal, mental health and [physical] health” issues —  The Local reports the    was able to enter the school carrying “a revolver, a pistol, a hunting rifle and two grenades. ” Consider the November 13, 2015, terror attack on unarmed Parisians. In that attack, multiple terrorists opened fire with   or   rifles. They killed 130 innocents. The universal background checks were not a hindrance, and the rest of the French gun laws were powerless to prevent the attack. It is important to note that A Review of French Gun Laws (2012) shows that the background check in France is an ongoing process rather than a one time event. Such checks entail acquiring and maintaining “an active shooting club [membership]” and going to the range “at least three times a year. ” They also include “seeing a doctor every year,” who declares one “physically and mentally capable of owning a firearm,” and filling out various pieces of paperwork as well. Yet 130 innocents were gunned down on November 13, 2015. And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Twelve innocents —  including two police officers —  were gunned down by armed terrorists who were not hindered by strict gun control. French police unions responded to the Charlie Hebdo attack by explaining that gun control simply was not working for them they could not continue to walk the streets of Paris presuming that terrorists would not acquire arms. The Associated Press reported that the police unions demanded “more” guns and “heavier” guns, as well as “protective gear, better training for   and more legal tools to guard against terrorists. ” Gun control reduces   citizens’ ability to defend themselves and places police officers at a marked disadvantage. On the other hand, it poses no hindrance to determined terrorists who target citizens and police officers alike.

383,"52 Views October 31, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News With most markets on lockdown on Halloween trading day, here is a big picture view of where the world is headed. Stephen Leeb: “This past week a New York Times headline that caught my eye was: “At Heart of U.S. Strategy; Weapons That Can Think.” The gist was that over the next few years the U.S. will be spending billions of dollars to make “smart” weapons, while also boosting our cyber budget by billions of dollars. It struck me as another example of how anytime we in the U.S. pound our chest about our mighty military, we always point to how much money have spent and plan to spend… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Michael O’Harlan and David Petraeus, men with exceptional military pedigrees, declare: “U.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses and in many areas…they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries…Nor is this likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States’ closest competitor, China.” Reassuring words? Maybe for a moment. But as soon as you think about it, they become anything but reassuring, showing that even when it comes to our most vital security issues, we make the fundamentally flawed assumption that money equates to wealth. I’ve long been convinced that if the U.S. continues on what appears an ever more inevitable slide, historians will point to the day Nixon dropped the gold standard as launching that skid. Gold is wealth; paper is merely money. Money can facilitate the exchange of wealth, but by itself it is just paper or entries on a computer ledger and a very poor substitute for wealth. Commodities are wealth, and many vital commodities, as we pointed in a recent interview, can’t even be purchased any more – period. Information is also wealth. And no amount of money can guarantee an edge in information. A few weeks ago, a 15- or 16-year-old who had recently become interested in chess wrote a letter to a chess blog asking how much he’d need to spend to become a Grand Master – how much for training, how much for practice time, coaches, etc. The only possible answer: not all the money in the world could turn a novice who’s already a teenager into a world-class player. Grand masters have a wealth of knowledge and savvy that can’t be acquired once you’re much past 7 or 8 years old. You’ve missed the boat. Similarly, no amount of money enabled U.S. experts to crack the cell phone of the San Bernardino terrorists. But cyber experts from Israel, which spends a lot less on cyber issues, cracked it with relative ease. Israel, along with China and Russia, are among a number of countries, mostly located in Asia, that develop the skills of their gifted children at early ages. This has left the U.S. a poor second in critical areas ranging from cyber security to super computers, which will be the most essential tools in the next generation of a gold-centered monetary system. Even nonbelievers should be starting to perceive the inevitability of gold replacing paper. A few metrics tell the story. First is the relationship between the dollar and economic growth. Despite the recent report of better-than-expected third-quarter GDP, the economy’s growth has been declining as the dollar has risen. In the wake of the Great Recession the dollar traded in a fairly tight range, while GDP growth in fits and starts peaked at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The higher dollar has held GDP growth to less than 2 percent for the past two years. But commodities have begun to rise. Most major commodity indexes have climbed 10 percent or more this year. Even the temporary setback in obtaining an OPEC agreement won’t hold back real goods. Recently, for the first time since China announced its Silk Road initiative in 2013, a major article on the undertaking appeared in a major magazine, Foreign Affairs. Gal Luft , a senior advisor to the United States Energy Security Council, urged Washington to get aboard or lose out on the chance to benefit from the greatest infrastructure project in the history of civilization, many times the size of the Marshall Plan and already the destination of $1 trillion in Chinese exports this year, with dramatic growth likely for the foreseeable future. But instead we’re likely to continue to use our dollars in ways that bear ever less connection to real wealth. Bear in mind that any effort to hold inflation down will crumble in the face of Western economies even weaker than ours. The result is that real interest rates will remain negative, an unalloyed positive for gold. At the same time the currency used along the Silk Road will be some combination of gold, the SDR, and the yuan. As we have said before, China’s edge in critical information technologies ensures its domination in virtual currencies such as the bitcoin, which will have multiple advantages in tomorrow’s gold-based world. How High Will Gold & Silver Trade? How high will gold go? Much depends on how much trade the Silk Road generates. Which means that if think gold could go to five digits, you don’t need a shrink – you’re sane as can be. And let’s not overlook gold’s poor cousin, which in the end could make you even richer, silver. The energies of our future will be anchored to solar, nuclear, and wind. The solar anchor will mean that already peaking silver will become some of the scarcest wealth around. If you’re dreaming of $100 silver, your dreams will be coming true before long. To me it’s an ironic footnote to the Nixon years. Yes, history will record that America’s decline began when the much-maligned Nixon delinked the dollar from gold and let us conflate money and wealth. Meanwhile, though, you can make a fortune on the coming bull market in gold that will be the direct result of that decision.”   The Coming Super Depression,   Cyberwars, $10,000 Gold & $1,000 Silver CLICK  ",1

385,"Rock and folk legend Bob Dylan has been accused of lifting sections of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech from a SparkNotes. com summary of Moby Dick. [Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylan’s speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the “Blowin’ in the Wind” singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes  —   a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts  —   but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: “Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness” From SparkNotes: “someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness. ” Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylan’s lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel. The Nobel Foundation awarded Dylan the prestigious prize in October, which sparked considerable controversy over the very definition of literature, and and the enigmatic music legend didn’t acknowledge the honor for weeks. The musician declined to attend December’s Nobel ceremony in Stockholm, citing scheduling issues. The Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize, published Dylan’s speech on June 5, in the form of a   recording, and called it “extraordinary” and “eloquent” in a press release. The organization has not responded to the accusations. While Dylan has not responded to the accusations, however, he has been accused of borrowing phrases from other artists in the past. “It is nothing new that Mr. Dylan might take inspiration from a   work to prepare something else,” Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer and musician, told the Associated Press. “Songwriters, including Dylan, have been borrowing from other literary works to turn pop phrases for ages. Consider Led Zeppelin’s ample use of Tolkien’s classic works in many of their songs. ” The “surprise here is that rather than borrowing from classic literature, Mr. Dylan took his ‘inspiration’ this time from crib notes,” Weinberg said. “But that should not raise eyebrows either. Even John Lennon was known to use things as ordinary as a newspaper clipping or circus posters to embellish lyrics. ” Listen to the lecture in full below:   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",0

387,"What might the American economy look like if   had not engaged in decades of brutal betrayal against American workers? [A new report from the Congressional Budget Office provides an   answer to the question by examining a sector of the labor market whose wages have been largely shielded from the effects of trade deals, immigration, and   regulation. These workers receive wages and benefits that are, on average, about 17 percent higher than workers with comparable skills and education in other parts of the economy.  The compensation gap is striking. The workers in the protected sector are better compensated than unprotected peers at every level of educational attainment aside from those with professional degrees or doctorates. The compensation gap is largest, in fact, for those workers who would otherwise be among the most vulnerable in the economy: workers with no more than a high school degree. According to the CBO study, the total compensation for protected workers with a high school diploma or less earned 53 percent more than their unprotected peers. So who are these protected workers? They are members of the federal government’s civilian workforce. The federal government employs about 1. 5 percent of the U. S. workforce, around 2. 2 million workers. They are spread across more than 100 agencies and over 650 occupations. In fiscal year 2016, the federal government spent around $215 billion to compensate these workers. On average, they tend to be older, more educated, and more concentrated in professional occupations than   workers. The CBO studied data from 2011 through 2015 to estimate the differences between the wages and benefits of federal employees and similar   employees. It sorted the data by level of education, years of work experience, occupation, size of employer, geographic location, veteran status, and demographic characteristics such as ages, sex, race, and marital status. What it found was that federal workers tend to earn far more than their private sector counterparts. Between 2010 and 2015, federal workers with a high school degree or less had wages that were 34 percent higher than private sector peers and benefits that were 93 percent greater, for a total compensation gap of 53 percent. For workers with a bachelor’s degree, the wage gap was 21 percent, composed of a 5 percent wage gap and a 52 percent benefit gap. Aside from those with the highest levels of education, the compensation gap has grown in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010, for example, the total compensation gap for workers with a high school diploma or less was 36 percent. The gap for those with a bachelor’s degree was 15 percent. An adjustment to whom is counted as a federal employee caused some of this difference. But the larger part of it was caused by the fact that wages grew more quickly among less educated federal workers than those in the private sector. This is even more striking because lawmakers froze    salary increases for federal workers between 2011 through 2013. Without this freeze, the gap would have grown even larger. Federal workers are shielded from a lot of the effects of globalization that have depressed private sector worker compensation. Their jobs are not easily or often subject to   the practice of replacing employees in the U. S. with employees located in foreign countries. Similarly, outsourcing does not weigh on federal workers the way it does private sector workers. Competition from immigrants is far less of a factor because the U. S. government has stringent rules against hiring illegal immigrants and does not directly seek workers from abroad to fill jobs. While the federal government hires immigrant workers, it does so from the pool that is already legally residing in the United States. Trade hardly impacts federal worker compensation at all. Civilian federal employees working in the Defense Department, the largest group of federal workers, are not in wage competition with defense workers in foreign lands. That is true for almost all federal workers, in fact. From the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to the U. S. Treasury and the Justice Department, the wage competition faced by employees is purely domestic. Unlike the private sector, where employment and wages are depressed because of regulation, the federal government benefits from increased regulation. Each new regulation requires employees to enforce and monitor compliance. And most regulations impose few barriers to projects that the federal government pursues.  Look at it from the    of the agencies. They are confined to hiring, for the most part, American citizens and legal residents. They compete with other government agencies and the private sector for workers. While the private sector can turn abroad for workers, the federal agencies cannot. The result is higher wages and better benefits for federal workers. Importantly, many of the   sources of wage stagnation that impact the private sector also weigh on the federal sector. Communications technology, for example, has made many occupations once filled by workers in the federal government redundant. Robotics, improved computer processing, and the Great Recession —  recall that wage   wage freeze —  have all hit federal workers. Yet the compensation grew. That leaves the effects of trade and immigration policy as the most likely culprits. The absence of a wage gap for those with a doctorate or professional degree is telling. In the private sector, these are workers who have faired relatively well in the age of globalization. Many have seen the demand for their work —  and therefore their prosperity —  rise as lawyers, bankers, and other professions ply their trade internationally. So it is no surprise that the federal workers with advanced degrees earn 18 percent less than private sector counterparts. This fact also undermines a competing narrative explaining the wage gap —  that it is a result of a reckless federal government that spends   and cannot resist pressure for higher wages. If that were so, all federal workers would be expected to earn more. The compensation gap could also explain why so many federal workers do not look favorably on President Donald Trump. They just have not experienced the economic impact of globalization the way many of Donald Trump’s private sector supporters have. The CBO report is a glimpse into a shadow world, an alternate reality of an American economy absent the trade and immigration policy decisions that have dragged down all but the best educated and highest earning segments of the American workforce. It shows us an America where a worker without a high school diploma is far better paid and the rewards to the elites are far less grand. It is the world without the carnage that globalization has sown in the American economy. It is, more hopefully, a roadmap to making America great again.",0
388,"On The News Line ©AFP These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: The Syria conundrum The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. It’s been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters. EU threat of disintegration Things seem to be falling apart in Europe which many believe is under strain from many factors ranging from the Brexit to the rise of the far-right across the European political spectrum to the refugee crisis, which is the worst to hit the continent. The prospect of the European Union seems so bleak that it has rung the alarm in Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned: ""The financial crisis, the refugee influx into Europe and the shock from the Brexit referendum in Great Britain have brought the European Union into violent turmoil.” Steinmeier warned that this might lead to the collapse of the EU. Saudis aim to starve Yemenis Reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is ""deliberately targeting impoverished Yemen’s farms and agricultural industry.""

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/prescription-painkiller-deaths-dropped.html In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, you’ll likely agree that it’s much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids.For the study , researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers.“ The difference is quite striking ,” said Colleen Barry, the study’s co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek .It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects. In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually ( source ).While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain. “You don’t have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,” he argues. The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths.While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

391,"One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year’s remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth. The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a   trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the   War II era. This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe. This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States,   gross domestic product rose by an average of 2. 2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000  —   but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0. 9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that. Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000,   G. D. P.  —   which generally tracks with the average American’s income  —   was about $45, 000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20, 000. To make matters worse, fewer and fewer people are seeing the spoils of what growth there is. According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. That number was 97 percent in Italy, 70 percent in Britain, and 63 percent in France. Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What’s worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle. It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine  —   and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren’t up to the task of fixing it (though some   policies could help). The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future  —   that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents  —   is thrown into question the longer this lasts. The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it’s happening. A good way to do that is to   predictions from smart economists. In January 2005, as it does every year, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast for the United States’ budget and economic outlook over the decade to come. If the C. B. O. ’s projections had come true, the United States would have had $3. 1 trillion more economic output in 2015 than it actually did  —   17 percent more. Even if the steep contraction of   hadn’t happened, the shortfall would have been $1. 7 trillion. As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy’s underperformance. In 2000, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, published a paper titled “Does the ‘New Economy’ Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past?” It argued that the internet would not have the same transformative impact on how much economic output would emerge from an hour of human labor as   innovations like electricity, air transport and indoor plumbing did. It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. “People said: ‘Productivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You’re wrong we’re in a new age,’ ” Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, “people started to take my point of view more and more seriously. ” He offers the example of the    computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a   bump than a continuing trend. Douglas   director of the C. B. O. at the time of the 2005 forecast and now president of the American Action Forum, said technology “just seems to be less special and more comparable to other forms of investments than it had seemed. ” The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent. But it’s not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago. The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C. B. O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5. 2 percent it was 4. 9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force  —   neither working nor looking  —   in 2015 than projected. An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection) and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious “residual”: younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate. Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the “supply” side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too. Think of the economy as a car if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it’s capable of, a car won’t go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntary exit of people from the labor force and    gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation. That’s not what’s happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all. The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the   problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force. But what if it’s both? Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates. In November 2013, he combined those observations into a   speech at an I. M. F. conference arguing that the global economy had, just maybe, settled into a state of “secular stagnation” in which there was insufficient demand, and resulting slow growth, low inflation and low interest rates. While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years. But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don’t think there will be demand for their products. Mr. Summers, in an interview, frames it as an inversion of “Say’s Law,” the notion that supply creates its own demand: that economywide, people doing the work to create goods and services results in their having the income to then buy those goods and services. In this case, rather, as he has often put it: “Lack of demand creates lack of supply. ” His proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply  —   helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump. Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the   economic rival of the United States. In other words, there’s a lot we don’t know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn’t change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.",0

Setting speed limits had been the states’ responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That’s the fastest in the country, though it’s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany’s autobahn have no maximum limit. It’s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour.

394,"LOS ANGELES  —   The entire Hollywood press corps turned up. So did dozens of Chinese executives from the   Dalian Wanda Group, some of whom were introduced as “special dignitaries. ” Studio executives? Check. Leaders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Grinning from the front row. But why were there also four women in gold evening gowns serving as ushers and M. C.’s? And why was the “Star Wars” score used as part of the Monday affair, which was held to promote Wanda’s $5 billion studio complex in Qingdao as a home away from home for Hollywood? The answer seemed to be: because Wanda wanted it that way. And, at least for eager Hollywood executives hoping to tap into the   Chinese box office, that was answer enough. As the Motion Picture Association of America’s chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, said in a video infomercial for the Qingdao complex that played as part of the event, “Any time an audience grows, everyone benefits. ” The 5 p. m. presentation, held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began with remarks by Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the academy, an institution dedicated in part to celebrating artistic freedom. “We have so much in common,” Ms. Boone Isaacs said of the Chinese and American film industries. “Art. Creativity. Conscience. Conviction. Just telling your story. ” Hollywood, of course, has been frustrated that Chinese censors restrict the flow of American films into China only a few dozen foreign films are allowed to be exhibited annually. But Ms. Boone Isaacs kept it gauzy. “This art form, like an   carousel, is at its best when it takes us around the world,” she said of cinema. Next up: Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made bolstering the movie industry a priority of his administration. Specifically, he has criticized the practice of studios moving production to other states and countries to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates. That, of course, is exactly the kind of runaway production funding that Wanda announced at Monday’s event. Mr. Garcetti tried to have it both ways. After noting that efforts to bring back production have borne fruit, he said, “We also are not a place that closes in. ” He added, “We will be strong about promoting Los Angeles as a place to film, but we will also be proud to make those international links that are core to our businesses growing. ” With that, Mr. Garcetti introduced Wang Jianlin, Wanda’s chairman. For his part, Mr. Wang spent most of his speech (delivered in Mandarin, with translation provided to the audience via headphones) highlighting the spectacular growth of the Chinese box office. Within a decade, he noted, China will not only far surpass the United States as a movie marketplace, it will control more than 40 percent of global ticket sales. He got a round of applause when he said that American studios needed to “improve the quality” of their movies. “In the recent few years, perhaps because Hollywood movies are trying to minimize their risk, there are less original movies,” he said. After criticizing Hollywood’s   on special effects, he added, “Now that Chinese audiences are smarter, they do not so easily become happy. ” It was almost a wrap. But first came more details about the 40 percent rebate Wanda will offer studios for filming at its    “movie metropolis” in Qingdao. Invited to the stage were executives from studios that had already signed up, including Lionsgate,   Legendary Entertainment, Arclight Films and Kylin Pictures. As one of the women in gold gowns said in closing, “It’s very exciting!”",0
395,"by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente . Dallas readers: Yves writes to say her plane is getting in early, and so, there having been no untoward events, the Meetup will be held as scheduled! TPP, TTIP, TISA CETA: A week of pressure from four Belgian regions opposed to CETA, led by the courageous Walloons, produced a revised “joint interpretive instrument” and, importantly, a new list of conditions that must be met before Belgium can ratify the deal” [ Rabble.ca ]. “Unfortunately, the joint interpretive ‘instrument’ is mostly artful deception. To take just one example, the instrument’s affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. ‘The critical point missing,’ as we wrote previously, ‘is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'” So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! Wallonia’s principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium’s federal government to sign CETA. For example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA’s investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium’s regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. This means that CETA’s investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA’s provisional application in all European member states. The German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany’s second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. So while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA’s full ratification even less likely. CETA’s passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. And then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment– CETA: “CETA puts Canada’s trade debate to rest once and for all” [ Globe and Mail ]. “The rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country’s trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.” CETA: “What the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade” [ Fortune ]. “All of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement… Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.” TISA: “The 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows — where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position — and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners.

The Voters “[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There’s something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats” [ The Baffer ]. “When our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It’s messy ‘maintaining’ history, after all.” “Early Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results” [ RealClearPolitics ]. One of several reasons: “[W]e don’t know the effect to which campaign strategy is creating the appearance of a participation surge by merely cannibalizing Election Day voters by mobilizing voters who would have voted on Election Day anyway.” Downballot “The presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats” [ Cook Political Report ]. ” Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news… Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.” Well done, DSCC: For Senate this year, Dems nominated two weed opponents (NV, NH), corp lobbyists (PA, IN), & a trust fund kid former Republican (FL) &mdash; Lee Fang (@lhfang) November 2, 2016 The Trail “SEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia” [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? “[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that’s down 5 points from its peak last week” [ ABC ]. ” Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.” Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it’s madness to focus on individual polls; RCP’s 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. “With the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to “come home'” [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump’s attention somehow. Or Ivanka. “Donald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out” [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ].

Realignment “Will this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?” [ McClatchy ]. “Just days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline.

Democrat Email Hairball “Opinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins” [ MarketWatch ]. “[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton’s lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump’s claim that this scandal is “worse than Watergate” could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.” “U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton’s actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president” [ Beloit Daily News ]. “Johnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records ‘shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.’‘I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,’ Johnson said. ‘I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'” In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term “public records” becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn’t simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that’s exactly what she did with “her”— that is, the public’s — mail. “Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a ‘constitutional crisis’ if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, ‘I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I’m speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him” [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn’s post today .

If borne out, that forecast would indicate this year’s plunging freight rates and shrinking profits for marine carriers will only grow worse, particularly on major trade lanes across the Pacific and between Asia and Europe” [ Wall Street Journal , “More Pain Ahead for Ocean Shipping”]. “The shipping industry hasn’t adjusted to a slowdown in global trade, with shipyards churning out giant container vessels and carriers holding onto excess capacity even as rates fall. Historically, container shipping demand grew over 5% annually, often outpacing global economic growth. Between 2015 and 2020, BCG estimates container demand will rise between 2.2% and 3.8% annually.” And we’re still building out warehouses… Shipping: “Cummins shipped just 16,400 engines in North America in the quarter, down 33% from a year ago.

Well, the difference isn’t that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama’s DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the “wrong” color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework). “Want to Help the Standing Rock Sioux? Here’s Where to Donate” [ Money (!!)]. “A GoFundMe set up by protester Ho Waste Wakiya Wicasa has raised more than $1 million, which will be used for the camp’s operating expenses. “The money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn’t have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,” Wicasa told Fox News.

396,"Breakdown of the Clinton Money Machine November 12, 2016 As troubling as Donald Trump’s election may be, it carries greater hope for some positive good than the alternative of Hillary Clinton, who represented a corrupt, money-churning machine, writes John Chuckman. By John Chuckman Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations, which deserve attention and which unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons (and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment and progressivity). The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American oligarch, a self-proclaimed billionaire, a man with a lifetime’s economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ever-flowing with money for their ambitions. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo) It was the ever-flowing well of money, drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends, such as Jeffrey Epstein, that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party. It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship – although Bill, in his heyday, displayed some of both of those – that earned the Clintons their place, it was the money, the “mother’s milk of politics.” In what is euphemistically called “fund raising,” many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clinton’s efforts. Hillary Clinton fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence. She lacked Bill’s superficial charm, but she certainly more than shared his ambition. On the charm front, when she was ready to move into running for office, she adopted, perhaps under Bill’s tutelage, a kind of forced set of expressions with arched eyebrows, bugged-out eyes, and a smile as big as her lips would allow. These expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helter-skelter whenever she campaigned. Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant. These were not natural for her. They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife, both in a governor’s mansion and later in the White House, bizarre because she indulged her husband’s non-stop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politician-husband. Money Talks Anyway, Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics. She determined to build a political war chest long ago, and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view, as when running for the Senate, when sources of big money suggested another view would be more acceptable. She was anything but constant in the views that she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money, embarrassingly large amounts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30, 2012. [State Department photo] In her years of speaking engagements, she aimed at special interests that could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees. Later, in the influential, appointed post of Secretary of State – coming, as it does, into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed, big-time international schemer – she unquestionably played an aggressive “pay for play” with them all. It appears that covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about.A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading. The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time. It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks, hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like “family values,” public prayer in schools and catering to the Christian Right – along with anti-flag burning Constitutional amendments — and now it is truly out of gas. The Republican Party had been given a breather, some new life, by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He had an extremely mixed record as President, but he was popular, held in some affection, and did have a clear vision, but his effect on the party was not lasting. Trump could be seen as another Reagan, but I think the comparison is superficial. Trump literally hijacked the party. He was not deliriously crowned by its establishment. The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors, including the Whigs and Free-Soil Democrats. Parties do not last forever, and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party, a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed. In the Republican primaries, he was opposed by tired, boring men like Jeb Bush, seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency, and a dark, intensely unlikable, phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz, and it proved to be no contest. Trump’s capture of the GOP nomination was a remarkable political achievement, but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party. The press was too busy attacking Trump from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis, and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the Establishment that he represented. His most promising quality was his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the Neocon Wars that Hillary Clinton embraced and promised to expand. A Democratic Party in Trouble But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble, too. It has a great deal of internal rot, as the WikiLeaks material from the Democratic National Committee clearly shows us. Arrogance, lack of direction, ignorance of the people whom the party has always claimed to serve, bad decision-making, and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN. It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot. She has always had strong negatives in polling, always been (rightly) suspected concerning her honesty. The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts, including harsh high-level judgments of Hillary’s decision-making, resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes, and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run. And, frankly, Hillary Clinton had become for many a rather tiresome, used-up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected. But they not only blindly supported her, they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender, Bernie Sanders. Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats, but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out-of-hand. After all, there were Bill and Hillary beckoning toward their running well of money. In hindsight, it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination. He proved a weak individual in the end, giving in to just the forces that he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down. There he was, out on the hustings, supporting everything he ever opposed as personified in Hillary Clinton. Men of that nature do not stand up well to Generals and Admirals and the heads of massive corporations, a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display. Public Distrust Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat. The numbers are unmistakable. Yes, Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure, but Hillary simply did badly, not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states, again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a well-liked figure and the Party blundered badly in running her. President-elect Donald Trump But again, money talks, and the Clintons, particularly Bill, are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime. No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money. Now, to many Americans, the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution, although a revolution conducted through ballots, any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military-security state. In a way, it does represent something of a revolutionary event, owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views. And, as in any revolution, even a small one, there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes. The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come. Lyndon Johnson, life-long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War, did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president. Franklin Roosevelt, son of wealthy establishment figures, provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression, restoring hopes and dreams for millions. Change, important, change, never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties. It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality. I have some limited but important hopes for Trump. I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person, and after the experience of Barack Obama, who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing, bloody disappointment, I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician. And what was the choice anyway? Hillary Clinton was a bought-and-paid one-way ticket to hell. Trump offers two areas of some hope, and these both represent real change. The first is in reducing America’s close to out-of-control military aggressiveness abroad. This aggressiveness, reflecting momentum from what can only be called the Cheney-Rumsfeld Presidency, continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as Secretary of State. Hillary did a lot of killing during her tenure inside the federal government, advocating and promoting military interventions as First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. She along with Obama is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of men, women and children, many of them literally torn apart by bombs. Welfare of Americans The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary Americans who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades. George W. Bush’s lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina (before he was internationally shamed into some action) has become the normal pattern for America’s national government when it comes to ordinary Americans. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a press conference. Inside the Democratic Party, the truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role, and of course never did in the Republican Party. By welfare, I do not mean the kind of state assistance to the poor that Bill Clinton himself worked to end. Nothing can impress someone not familiar with America’s dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicago’s South Side, parts of New Orleans, or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes. No, I mean the people’s general well-being. Trump’s approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs. I don’t know whether he can succeed, but, just as he asked people in some of his speeches, “What do you have to lose?” Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the “deplorables” is a small gain. People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive, and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary. His record as President – apart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs – was actually pretty appalling. In his own words, he “ended welfare as we know it.” He signed legislation that would send large numbers of young black men to prison. He also signed legislation that contributed to the country’s later financial collapse under George W. Bush. He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off, leaving them dangling, when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming. His FBI conducted the assault on Waco, killing about 80 people needlessly. A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason. There were a number of scandals that were never fully explained to the public. It was his Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who answered, unblinkingly, a television interviewer’s question about a half million Iraqi children who died owing to America’s embargo, “We think the price is worth it.” He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade, including the intentional destruction of the Serb TV building. When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government, the order secretly went out to shut up about it. No effort was made to intervene in that case. No, any real change in America could never come from people like the Clintons, either one of them. John Chuckman is former chief economist for a large Canadian oil company.",1

Trump has packed his cabinet with nominees who dispute the science of global warming. He has signaled he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. He has belittled the notion of global warming and attacked policies intended to combat it. But California  —   a state that has for 50 years been a leader in environmental advocacy  —   is about to step unto the breach. In a show of defiance, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and legislative leaders said they would work directly with other nations and states to defend and strengthen what were already far and away the most aggressive policies to fight climate change in the nation. That includes a legislatively mandated target of reducing carbon emissions in California to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. “California can make a significant contribution to advancing the cause of dealing with climate change, irrespective of what goes on in Washington,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “I wouldn’t underestimate California’s resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction. Yes, we will take action. ” The prospect of California’s elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California’s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state’s vast research community  —   including two national laboratories  —   which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. “They could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,” said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. “That would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones. ” And some business leaders warned that California’s embrace of environmental regulations  —   from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors  —   could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. “If the other states pursue    policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,” said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills “impose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone’s daily lives or the fact that California’s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,” the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2. 5 trillion. “California more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,” said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. “We will not deviate from our leadership because of one election. ” The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. “This is not something that’s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,” said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science. ” Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the   industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state’s energy and climate initiatives. “But they would be fighting a very uphill battle,” she said. “Politically, it’s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down. ” California’s economy is powered by a   industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative, backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries  —   more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion  —   that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. California’s    program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on    policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. The   initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very   policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California’s economic reversal. “If the   and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,” Mr. de Leon said. “They will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G. D. P. ” Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. “Our system works better  —   our    system and other ways of addressing climate change  —   if we have more company,” said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. “The more company we have, the better. ” Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can “keep doing what we are doing, leading the way. ” “But will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that’s why it’s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,” he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an   environmental movement. “We’ve got the lawyers and we’ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,” Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. “We’re ready to win. ” Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump’s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. “In a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,” he said. “The shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world. ”",0

400,"Fifth Varshavyanka submarine joins Russia’s Navy 26 October 2016 TASS By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. Facebook submarines , russian navy , black sea fleet The fifth non-nuclear submarine of project 636.3, The Veliki Novgorod, has joined the Russian Navy, a TASS correspondent reports from the flag-hoisting ceremony at the Admiralty Shipyards in St. Petersburg, attended by the Russian Navy’s Deputy commander, Vice-Admiral Alexander Fedotenkov and the shipyards’ CEO Alexander Buzakov. ""The Veliki Novgorod submarine has been through all government certification tests. All of the previous submarines in that series built for the Black Sea Fleet have confirmed the expected parameters, too,"" Buzakov said. The Veliki Novgorod is the fifth in the group of six submarines of project 636.3 (Varshavyanka) built for the Black Sea Fleet. The first two - The Novorossiysk and The Rostov-on-Don were delivered in 2014, and another two, The Stary Oskol and The Krasnodar, in 2015. By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. The flag-hoisting ceremony is due November 25. Another six Varshavyanka subs will be built at the Admiralty shipyards for the Pacific Fleet. The contract was signed at the Army-2016 forum near Moscow. The last submarine in the second group is to be delivered in 2021. First published by TASS . ",1
401,"It may not qualify as a   eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G. E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight  —   but to what end? That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G. E. couldn’t make use of it. “We had to be more capable in software,” Mr. Immelt said he decided. Maybe G. E.  —   a maker of power turbines, jet engines, locomotives and   equipment  —   needed to think of its competitors as Amazon and IBM. Back then, G. E. was returning to its   roots and navigating the global financial crisis, shedding much of its bloated finance arm, GE Capital. That winnowing went on for years as billions of dollars in assets were sold, passing a milestone this summer when GE Capital was removed from the government’s short list of financial institutions deemed “too big to fail. ” But in 2011, G. E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif. 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay. Today one of San Ramon’s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale  —   a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G. E.’s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a “top 10 software company” by 2020. Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical. “G. E. is trying to do this the way a big company does, by throwing thousands of people and billions of dollars at it,” said Thomas M. Siebel, a technology entrepreneur who is now chief executive of C3 IoT, a   that has done work for G. E. “But they’re not software people. ” The San Ramon complex, home to GE Digital, now employs 1, 400 people. The buildings are designed to suit the   working ways of software developers:   floors, bench seating, whiteboards, couches for impromptu meetings, balconies overlooking the grounds and kitchen areas with snacks. Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G. E. a    company and the nation’s largest manufacturer, with more than 300, 000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and   habits of Silicon Valley to G. E.’s world of industrial manufacturing. G. E.’s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it “probably the most important thing I’ve worked on in my career. ” Apparently, there is no Plan B. “It’s this or bust,” he said. The march of digital technology  —   mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software  —   into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of “the internet of things” or “the industrial internet. ” It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines. It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G. E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts. So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down. The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G. E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G. E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but “business outcomes,” like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain. Yet all of this exposes G. E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of  . There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn’t changed much in generations. “The real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,” said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “G. E. has no choice but to try to do that itself. ” Recently, G. E. has lured software engineers and data scientists from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Early on, though, it struggled simply to hire. Last year it began running   television ads, featuring young hires, aimed at closing the company’s image gap of industrial giant but digital midget. (Applications at GE Digital jumped eightfold, the company says.) Until this year, Darren Haas hadn’t thought about G. E. certainly not working there. To him, G. E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. “I had no idea,” Mr. Haas said. But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of   software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G. E. and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital. That someone of Mr. Kodesh’s caliber was a G. E. convert got Mr. Haas’s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G. E. equipment plays across the economy  —   in transportation, in hospitals  —   “a whole world,” he said. “I found that really, really compelling. ” The other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G. E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the   digital assistant   Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud. At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology  —   machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing  —   to the industrial arena. “I’ve got my work cut out for me,” he said. Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G. E.’s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G. E.’s software ambitions. Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G. E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G. E. industrial businesses. But that soon felt too small. The issue was “outside disrupters,” Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging   Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that “bring greater productivity  —   but don’t own the assets they sell. ” G. E. Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate   company. The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G. E. reimagined Predix as a   operating system for industrial applications. Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. “Those companies are going to encroach on the territory,” Mr. Kodesh said. “Are we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?” The basic idea is that G. E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and   the operation of equipment like   rigs and   turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines. Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G. E. is following an   model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors  —   more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft. Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. “Some will be G. E.’s, and some will be made by   developers,” he said. G. E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high. For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software  —   “a false positive”  —   might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100, 000 mistake. “We really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,” he said. G. E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business  —   more than 90 percent of it software  —   may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now. For Predix to reach its potential, though, G. E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the   parade, but will others follow? This will be a major test. And G. E.’s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest. In late July, G. E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1, 200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation. G. E. has some   advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world’s electricity is generated on G. E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G. E. machinery. G. E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the   aviation and health care industries. G. E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software. When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a   company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be “a   journey,” he said. “We’re in the middle of that journey. ” Part of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. “If G. E. is truly going to be a   company, we can’t be separate here,” Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital “tools and habits” need to be embedded “in how people do their jobs,” he said. In its factory in Greenville, S. C. G. E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work. The   building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G. E.’s new gas turbines. It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950, 000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2, 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500, 000 households. The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G. E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology. John Lammas, the    vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a   jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G. E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company’s jet engine and power turbine divisions. “I’m an old mechanical guy,” he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings. In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G. E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part. This    routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use   computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically. This goes a step beyond   design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G. E. calls a “digital thread. ” This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner. Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. “Jobs are combining in this digital world,” Mr. Lammas said. Greenville’s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with   sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1, 000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350, 000 a year. “We can see things we never did before,” Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530, 000 hours over three years, G. E. estimates. Not all the   ideas that G. E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with “minimum viable products,” particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator. Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry. “As an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,” said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. “It’s uncomfortable. But it’s been incredibly liberating. ” The old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. “Overcoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,” he said.",0
402,"How does a former senator . .. stateswoman . .. hoping to build a financial stockpile . .. find a way to make it worth her donors’ while? “Hamilton” tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  —   and status as “event chair” on offer for $100, 000  —   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. “I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show’s signature numbers. “As Washington tells us, history’s eyes are on us,” she said at one point, invoking “History Has Its Eyes On You. ” “Let’s not throw away our shot,” she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show’s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  —   “the only thing,” President Obama has joked, “that Dick Cheney and I agree on. ” The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. “Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president. ” Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy. “It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard. ”",0

404,"Trump the GreatPaul Craig RobertsLiberals, progressives, and the left-wing (to the extent that one still exists) are aligning with the corrupt oligarchy against president-elect Trump and the American people. They are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over Trump’s “authoritarian personality and followers.” In other words, the message is: here come the fascists.Liberals and progressives wailed and whined about “an all white male cabinet,” only to be made fools by Trump’s appointment of a black male and two women, one a minority and one a Trump critic.The oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt Trump’s inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize Trump the way the paid Maidan protesters were used in Kiev to delegitimize the elected Ukrainian government.To the extent any of the Trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs, such as George Soros, military and financial interests, and global capitalists, they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause Trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence Trump by offering support.At this point we don’t know what a Trump government is going to do. If he sells out the people, he won’t be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. We do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. Trump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy’s stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary’s support is very limited.We know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime’s sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don’t know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.One possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.Another possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.Another possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.What these protesters see as a threat in Trump’s strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.Trump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: “Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don’t have your good in mind. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.”It has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump’s words are what Americans were waiting to hear.As willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.As impressive as Trump’s billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.Congress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. As powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don’t occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.It is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.As for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. If Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump’s determination and the people’s support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets. The post Trump the Great — Paul Craig Roberts appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .",1
405,"Share This Hillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded – and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. There’s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. However, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it’s not only her presidential campaign that’s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she’s convicted of “obstruction of justice” – a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves As of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase “obstruction of justice,” but that doesn’t mean the idea isn’t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. We already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and “bleachbit” her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn’t have the emails they were looking for. Of course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn – and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary’s case. Things aren’t looking so good for Hillary Clinton Why did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple – redemption. According to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: “Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,” said the source. ‘They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.” Further speculation pertaining to Comey’s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. The fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey’s dismissal of Hillary’s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars – a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.",1
406,"Having booked their flights and secured their hotels, travelers often consider rental cars among the last of their   tasks, making the unprepared more vulnerable to the    of industry fees. “Our number one advice for renters is to do their homework,” said David Solomito, vice president of marketing for North America at Kayak. “For most people, rental cars are the least considered part of trip. ” As technology has changed travel  —   consider toll roads, which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  —   so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars. “It’s not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees, it’s just that there’s more of them,” said Rick Garlick, who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at J. D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). “Ancillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability,” he said. There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location that’s not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters’ wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought. Assuming you haven’t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. “At Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with,” wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a “fuel service” charge of $16. 07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40, 000 “connected” cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility. “We carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim,” wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. “Cars aren’t getting smarter, we need to be,” said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach. “If you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. ” Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes. Most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads. But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2. 95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4. 95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19. 75 per rental month Hertz charges $24. 75 maximum per rental agreement and Payless charges $14. 75 maximum for each rental period. Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3. 95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19. 75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists) avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The   can be used in most Northeastern and   states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a  . Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesn’t take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. “It messes with their inventory and planning,” said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. “Returning a car early is considered breaking the contract. ” How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car, for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, “to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. ” Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10   fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they don’t call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Parking or traffic tickets are the driver’s responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, it’s in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Avis’s contract says offenses will be charged back to the renter’s credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation. “What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away,” Ms. Fix said. “You have to be aware. ”",0
407,"WASHINGTON  —   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate’s    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, “coup” has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil’s entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party’s leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Jucá, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, “We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ” Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  —   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges “don’t rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,” adding: “It’s not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ” This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  —   which the impeachers were indeed doing  —   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  —   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil’s economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff’s supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  —   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff’s ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  —   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. “When people talk about ‘coup mongers,’ ” said Professor Smith, “they’re often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ” But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff’s staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  —   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil’s system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.",0
408,"  Donald J. Trump on Tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises, dropping his vow to jail Hillary Clinton, expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change. But in a   hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times  —   which was scheduled, canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules  —   Mr. Trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the American presidency. He said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his White House, conceding that the Trump brand “is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ” Still, he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses, which would be run by his children. He defended Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, against charges of racism, calling him a “decent guy. ” And he mocked Republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign. In the midday meeting in the   boardroom of The Times’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Mr. Trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job. “It is a very overwhelming job, but I’m not overwhelmed by it,” he said. He displayed a jumble of impulses, many of them conflicting. He was magnanimous toward Mrs. Clinton, but boastful about his victory. He was   about some of his positions, uncompromising about others. The interview demonstrated the volatility in Mr. Trump’s positions. He said he had no interest in pressing for Mrs. Clinton’s prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the Clinton Foundation. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” he said. On the issue of torture, Mr. Trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. “He said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful,’” Mr. Trump said. He added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects: “‘Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I’ll do better. ’” “I was very impressed by that answer,” Mr. Trump said. Torture, he said, is “not going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking. ” Mr. Trump repeated that Mr. Mattis was being “seriously, seriously considered” to be secretary of defense. “I think it’s time, maybe, for a general,” he said. On climate change, Mr. Trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying, “I’m looking at it very closely. ” Despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the Paris accords, Mr. Trump said that “I have an open mind to it” and that clean air and “crystal clear water” were vitally important. He held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas. He vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, where attendees gave the Nazi salute and criticized Jews. Asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws, Mr. Trump offered no specifics but told the group, “I think you’ll be happy. ” Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the “failing New York Times,” Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called “a great, great American jewel, world jewel. ” He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that “the law’s totally on my side” when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would “like to do something” and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for    photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. “If it were up to some people,” he said, “I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. ” Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms. Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. “I might have brought it up,” Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his    Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East. “The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants, but I don’t want to do that,” Mr. Trump said. But he said that Mr. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, “could be very helpful” in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Kushner “would be very good at it” and that “he knows the region. ” “A lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible  —   you can’t do it,” Mr. Trump added. “I disagree. I think you can make peace. ” “I have reason to believe I can do it,” he added. Mr. Trump spoke only in general terms about foreign policy. He said the United States should not “be a nation builder,” repeated his line from the campaign that fighting the war in Iraq was “one of the great mistakes in the history of our country,” and said he has some “very definitive” and “strong ideas” about how to deal with the violent civil war raging in Syria. He declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so. “We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria,” he said. The   said that he had talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the election, but he did not elaborate. He said it would be “nice” if he and Mr. Putin could get along, but he rejected the idea that any warming of relations would be called a “reset,” noting the criticism that Mrs. Clinton received after her attempts at bettering relations between the countries failed. “I wouldn’t use that term after what happened,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump made a forceful defense of Mr. Bannon, whom he named as his chief strategist and who has drawn charges of racism and  . This summer, Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News, the website he led, “the platform for the ” a white nationalist movement. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon had been dismayed at the reaction to his hiring. “I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or ” he said, “I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. ” Mr. Trump added: “I think he’s having a hard time with it because it’s not him. I think he’s been treated very unfairly. ” He also defended Breitbart, which has carried racist and   content, saying it was no different from The Times, only “much more conservative. ” Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a “great   relationship” with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. “I really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot,” he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races. He said that one of them, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, would “love to have a job in the administration. ” “I said, ‘No, thank you,’” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat to Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. “She refused to vote for me. ” He also criticized Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who vacillated over supporting Mr. Trump after an    recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged in lewd terms about grabbing women without their consent. “He went down like a lead balloon,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Heck. “I said, ‘Off the record, I hope you lose. ’” He said Republican leaders felt indebted to him for his surprise victory. “Right now,” Mr. Trump said, “they’re in love with me. ”",0
409,"Stephanie Danler’s first novel, “Sweetbitter,” about a young woman in New York City’s restaurant world, is going to make a lot of people hungry. It did me, at any rate. My copy, I notice, has some grease stains in it, a few red pepper flakes, a stubby bit of mint. “Sweetbitter” will be consumed with special avidity by young food people  —   sommeliers, cheesemakers, sous chefs, managers, pastry wizards  —   who dream of making it in the big city, or at least of making it by   standards. It’s an unpretentious,     novel  —   bought by Knopf  in an     deal  —   that reads like a letter home from a   friend. In this case, that friend is named Tess, like Thomas Hardy’s heroine and Melanie Griffith’s striving secretary in “Working Girl. ” This Tess is 22 when she escapes her unnamed hometown and its “twin pillars of football and church” and drives into Manhattan. “Let’s say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at 7 a. m.,” she says, “with the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. ” Thanks to her poise and friendly good looks, Tess finds a job as an apprentice server at a restaurant that’s clearly modeled after Union Square Cafe, one of Manhattan’s best. (The author has worked at Union Square Cafe and at another cheerful restaurant, Buvette.) She finds a scuzzy apartment in a cheap section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tess falls deeply into her work and feels the city begin to unfold for her. Ms. Danler is a sensitive observer of the almost wartime camaraderie among workers at a restaurant that’s humming at full capacity, of the exhaustion, of the postshift drinking in dive bars until dawn, of the sex and other stimulants  —   the biggest one simply being young and alive and open to the animal and intellectual possibilities that New York offers. Once upon a time, this sort of aspirational, young person’s novel was written about writers and artists. Food workers are climbing the status ladder. Now these novels are about chefs or even, in this case, servers. This book has an onrushing “Bright Lights, Big City” vibe and falls into an emerging genre you might call Bright Lights, Small Plates. A restaurant, like a platoon in a war novel, allows a writer to deploy a large cast with relative ease. In “Sweetbitter” we meet a handsome if   young bartender (“He drank like he was the only person who understood beer”) an enigmatic female head server who is Tess’s mentor and tormentor a harried chef a manager who does more than ogle his favorite female employees. None feel like stereotypes. A subtle sense of melancholy hangs over these men and women. They’re happy to be where they are in fact, they feel chosen. But they’re nearly all here because of other dreams that were thwarted. They’re failed poets or academics. Tess had hoped to be a photographer. “Sweetbitter” is the story of Tess’s sentimental education. We don’t learn much about her past. But in Manhattan we watch her  —   she is vulnerable but rarely weak  —   pour herself full with books and art and music, and blossom like a daisy. Mostly she fills herself with lovely things to eat and drink. Tess isn’t a hipster (“I cared too much about the wrong things”). And Ms. Danler isn’t another Anthony Bourdain manqué, delivering a caustic exposé. She takes the reader by the hand as Tess learns dozens of lessons, from distinguishing among varieties of oysters, types of winter lettuce and appellations of Burgundy to opening wine properly to appreciating a pig’s head terrine. Tess knows she will, at some point, want more than this. But for now this punishing life feels like ravishment. When a college acquaintance comes into the restaurant one night and condescends to her, only politeness prevents her from speaking aloud: “I chose this life because it’s a constant assault of color and taste and light and it’s raw and ugly and fast and it’s mine. And you’ll never understand. Until you live it, you don’t know. ” This novel, which reads a bit like a food world version of Curtis Sittenfeld’s “Prep,” gets off to a bad start. You notice that its four sections are named after the seasons, as if they were George Winston albums. At the beginning there are gimmicky interpolated sections about things like the nature of sweet versus sour. You fear you may be headed into a genre fiction tunnel of love. Those fears are quickly dispelled. Ms. Danler is a gifted commenter (chilly autumn air in Manhattan “tasted of steel knives and filtered water”) on many things, class especially. An awareness of privilege runs through this novel like a tendon. “If you’re good at this job,” she asks, “what exactly are you good at?” “Sweetbitter” grows darker than you might expect, in terms of where Tess’s desires lead her. It’s a book about hunger of every variety, even the sort that can disturb you and make you sometimes ask yourself, as does Tess, “Was I a monster or was this what it felt like to be a person?”",0
410,"GLENDALE, Ariz.  —   Mark Few wrote the introduction for a book by his college roommate about the power of perseverance. On Saturday night, the Gonzaga men’s basketball team, which Few has built from a midmajor curiosity into a championship contender, provided him with material for a postscript. Gonzaga, making its 19th consecutive N. C. A. A. tournament appearance but its first trip to the Final Four, advanced to the national championship game with a   victory over South Carolina at University of Phoenix Stadium. In the final on Monday night, the Bulldogs will face a fellow No. 1 seed, North Carolina, which beat Oregon by   later on Saturday. Nigel   a junior guard, contributed 23 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, and his freshman roommate, Zach Collins, added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Gonzaga, a program that thrust itself into the national consciousness by reaching the round of 8 in 1999  —   but until this season had never gotten any further. This season, the Bulldogs ( ) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the national polls before being dealt their only loss, to Brigham Young, in their final game of the regular season. On Saturday night, they could barely contain their excitement at the opportunity they had given themselves to be unequivocally known as college basketball’s best. Few, who is known for his   demeanor, was so overcome with emotion that he executed a handstand in the locker room. “I felt like I stuck it,” he said with a laugh, adding: “Sometimes I worry that my guys get like, it’s a job. And we’ve been on them to show emotion. So that’s my fairly weak effort of showing emotion. ” South Carolina ( ) a seventh seed that had defied all expectation to get so far, was also making its first trip to the Final Four. The Gamecocks were led by Chris Silva, who had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sindarius Thornwell, a senior guard who had not scored fewer than 24 points in a tournament game this year, was held to a relatively quiet 15. “We played our hearts out the way we did all year,” the senior Justin McKie said, “and Gonzaga played a great game. ” It was just a matter of patience. In his book, “Water the Bamboo,” Few’s college roommate, Greg Bell, used the plant as a metaphor for success. Even with regular watering, giant timber bamboo does not appear to make any gains for the first three years of its life. But then, suddenly, it will sprout 90 feet in just two months. It took the Bulldogs considerably longer to reach their newfound height, but that only made Saturday’s result all the sweeter. Few’s South Carolina counterpart, Frank Martin, overcame a hardscrabble childhood to build a successful career in coaching, and his tailored suits cannot hide his rough edges. His intensity, embodied by his icy sideline stare, has rubbed off on his players. After   the Gonzaga players gathered in a circle, and as they were breaking apart, a few South Carolina players sauntered through the huddle, bumping a few of the Bulldogs as they passed. Then, before the opening tip, Gonzaga center Przemek Karnowski approached Thornwell, one senior to another, and extended his hand. Thornwell, the Gamecocks’ leading scorer, brushed past him, leaving Karnowski to stare quizzically at Thornwell’s back and shrug. “Maybe that’s how he is,” Karnowski said after the game. “I don’t really know him personally. ” Karnowski was happy to be on the floor at all. He missed most of last season with a   injury that required surgery. At 7 feet 1 inch and 300 pounds, Karnowski had four inches and more than 70 pounds on Silva, the sophomore forward from Gabon who was given the gargantuan task of guarding him under the basket. Fourteen minutes into the game, Silva rose to block Karnowski’s shot and made contact with Karnowski, who fell to the floor like a   Douglas fir. No foul was called, and while he writhed in pain, the Gamecocks pushed the ball up the court, with P. J. Dozier feeding McKie for a   that tied the score at  . Karnowski was helped to the sideline with a sore right elbow and a poked right eye, leaving Gonzaga, which had by then gotten 6 points and 4 rebounds from him, with a hole in the middle. Collins, a   freshman forward, filled it immediately. He contributed three rebounds, including two on the defensive end, to go with 2 points and a blocked shot in a frenetic stretch over the next 2 minutes 30 seconds to help Gonzaga to a   halftime lead. By then, Karnowski was already in the locker room. He could not open his right eye. But those missed games from last season were enough for him. He was back in the lineup at the start of the second half. “The doctor said I’m good to go, so I was just real happy about it,” he said. Twice in the tournament, South Carolina had stormed back from halftime deficits, and it would be no different against Gonzaga. The first two times, Thornwell was the spark. This time it was Silva who led the charge as the Gamecocks tied the game at   and then took the lead on two free throws by Rakym Felder. “That just showed the heart of a lion,” Few said, adding, “It took everything we had to hold on and come back. ” Cultivated though it has been, Gonzaga’s offense did have to deal with a dry spell. The Bulldogs stalled when Karnowski’s teammates tried too often to force the ball inside to him, leading to turnovers that the Gamecocks turned into points at the other end. But it was a storm the Bulldogs could weather. Karnowski had 7 points in the second half to finish with 13. His understudy, Collins, had a sensational second half, with 6 points, 7 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. “We did a really good job, I thought, of just sticking together,” Karnowski said. “That’s what we did the entire season. We don’t have 37 wins for nothing. ” As Few and a handful of his players made their way up the steps to the   dais, the moderator announced, “Gonzaga has arrived. ” It just took longer than perhaps Few would have expected. “To be playing the last game of the year is crazy cool,” he said.",0

On this weekend’s broadcast of “Sunday Morning Futures” on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump’s deputy assistant Dr. Sebastian Gorka said Trump was “not an interventionist   . ”  Gorka said, “I would like to make one thing very clear because there’s been a lot of missed reporting on this. The president is not an interventionist   . nothing has changed from November 7th 2 today. He’s been explicit. We are not invading other people’s countries. This isn’t some neoconservative   administration. Nevertheless, we have obligations to our friends in the region and on top of that, things like weapons of mass distraction, nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue regimes, chemical weapons, those will not be countenanced because they are a threat to Americans as well and that is why you see the leadership out of the White House you are seen. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
412,"  Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor   31st, 2016 Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had   and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds   And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… Florida Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . Georgia Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . North Carolina Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . Ohio No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . Colorado Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . Arizona A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . Nevada One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US   told CNN. But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. But will we get it? Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.",1
413,"Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the “Great Democratic Inversion.” What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. A key word in Edsall’s analysis is “white.” Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters–blacks and Hispanics –are poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. {snip} There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. {snip} Republicans’ constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats’ sprawling coalition. The parties won’t fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can’t trust the GOP to represent them. If it doesn’t diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip} {snip}",1

I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people’s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. ” He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were “towering judges” and Scalia was “a lion of the law. ” He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as “one of the smartest and most courageous men I’ve ever known. ” Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him “so much. ” Gorsuch further stated, “[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn’t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what’s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives.

417,"During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana. With her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her   shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break. “I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a    mother in Deltona, Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because   marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O. K. ” Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers  —   another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health. Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient  —   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  —   can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk. “There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in   pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use. In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of    said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2. 4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.) Young    were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7. 5 percent of   to    said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44. Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb. In Pittsburgh,    born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention. Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers. “Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. “Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition. ” It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I. Q. “The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ” “You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic. Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing. “I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk. ’” In a statement, C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero. “While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said. Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes. ” Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted. ” Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now. ” There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women  —   instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord  —   and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself. Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit. To find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an   at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients. Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When    admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all. Pregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture. Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of   mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant. “Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy. “If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it. ” Stacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and   and she isn’t worried about his development. She still smokes pot  —   indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now. “I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said.",0

419,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Simone Manuel woke up Friday morning to confirmation that her victory in the   freestyle a few hours earlier had not been a dream. The proof was perhaps more surreal than Thursday night’s payoff: Instagram posts from LeBron James and Serena Williams. Manuel’s friend and fellow trailblazer Lia Neal had forwarded the messages after stumbling across them on Twitter. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I wish I could see her reaction right now,’” Neal said. “She doesn’t need to hear from anyone else. Those are like her two favorite athletes. ” Manuel’s popularity got an emphatic spike after she became the first   woman to win an individual swimming event at the Olympics. Manuel, a    Texan, shared the gold medal with    Penny Oleksiak, who also made history, becoming the youngest gold medalist from Canada. James wrote that he watched the race with his daughter. Williams posted a picture of Manuel and Simone Biles, who won the gymnastics   gold medal, and called them  “amazing. ” One mother posted a photograph on Twitter of her exuberant young black daughter posing in front of a television screen that showed Manuel being interviewed. By early Friday evening, it had more than 12, 000 likes. “I saw that picture,” Neal said. “I retweeted it. I was tearing up again. ” The top of the medals podium at Olympic Aquatics Stadium was crowded Thursday night, and not because there were   medalists for the first time in the Olympics since 2000, when Anthony Ervin, whose father is   and American Indian, tied his teammate Gary Hall Jr. in the 50 freestyle. Standing on the podium with her, Manuel said, were Neal, Ervin, Maritza Correira, Cullen Jones and all the black swimmers whose success shaped Manuel’s dreams. “This medal is not just for me, it’s for some of the   that have come before me, have been inspirations and mentors to me,” Manuel said. In 2012, Neal became the second   woman to make a United States Olympic swim team, after Correia in 2004. Neal was 17 and a rising senior in high school. Neal and Correia earned medals as members of 4x100 freestyle relays in their first Olympics. Correia won a silver, Neal a bronze. On Saturday, Neal raced in the morning heat for the American 4x100 relay team, which later took the silver. Neal, a rising senior at Stanford who grew up in Brooklyn, was asked which medal she considers more precious, her silver or the gold that Manuel earned in an upset. “I think Simone’s gold,” Neal said. “I just felt more when she touched the wall and saw that she won. I knew exactly what went into winning that gold medal. ” Neal feels a sisterly bond to Manuel, who is one year behind her at Stanford. In the   to the Olympics, they often felt as if people saw their stories as being only skin deep. On the way to becoming the first two black women to grace the same United States Olympic swimming team, Neal and Manuel often compared notes after news media interviews. To their growing frustration, race was often discussed more than their races. “We talk about it and acknowledge that other people talk about it,” Neal said, “but we’re like ‘O. K. we’re here, like everyone else here we’re training toward winning, toward representing their country in the best way possible. History comes along with that. ” She added, “It’s cool because we’re not seeking to make history or change lives, we’re just doing what we love. ” Neal sat with Manuel roughly two hours before Thursday’s final. They listened to music, including the song “1, 2 Step” by Ciara and Missy Elliott. Neal’s parting words were “Pipe It Up,” from Migos. Neal said she was shaking before Manuel’s race and started crying during the last 10 meters when it dawned on her that Manuel might win. The prerace favorites were Cate Campbell of Australia, who lowered the world record to 52. 08 in July, and her sister, Bronte, who had clocked a 52. 58 in April. Manuel posted a 53. 32 in the heats, a 53. 11 in the semifinals and a 52. 70 in the final. “I was super surprised,” Manuel said after the race. “I don’t think there was a definitive point where I thought I had the race. ” How shocking was the outcome? Sarah Sjostrom, the Swede who finished third, said, “Penny and the American girl winning, I think that was the biggest surprise of the meet. ” (Never mind that “the American girl” had finished sixth, four places behind Sjostrom, in the   freestyle final at last summer’s World Championships in Kazan, Russia). After Manuel finished giving interviews in the mixed zone, she fell into the arms of Neal and another Stanford teammate, Maya DiRado. “She was just bawling,” Neal said. “She was like: ‘I’m so happy you guys are my teammates. I couldn’t have done this without you guys. I love you. ’” Manuel’s sentiments meant the world to Neal, who was disappointed when she did not qualify for these Games in an individual event. “Why I broke down in tears and why I felt so much emotion when she won was because I was there with her every step of the way,” Neal said. “I knew exactly what it took to get to that point and win a gold medal firsthand. ” How long will it take for swimming in the United States to become colorblind? Is one gold enough to change the questions Manuel and Neal face? “I think this definitely catapults us many steps forward,” Neal said, adding, “I think just that one medal will bring so many different people into the sport and inspire so many different people. ” Manuel, who on Friday qualified for Saturday’s   freestyle final, said she looked forward to the day when she is known simply as a champion. After the 100 final, she said, “I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it’s not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title ‘black swimmer’ makes it seem like I’m not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I’m not supposed to be able to break records. ”",0

422,"Phys.org Mon, 24 Oct 2016 All the known major bacterial groups are represented by wedges in this circular ‘tree of life.’ The bigger wedges are more diverse groups. Green wedges are groups that have not been genomically sampled at the Rifle site –everything else has. Black wedges are previously identified bacteria groups that have also been found at Rifle. Purple wedges are groups discovered at Rifle and announced last year. Red wedges are new groups discovered in this study. Colored dots represent important metabolic processes the new groups help mediate. One of the most detailed genomic studies of any ecosystem to date has revealed an underground world of stunning microbial diversity, and added dozens of new branches to the tree of life. The bacterial bonanza comes from scientists who reconstructed the genomes of more than 2,500 microbes from sediment and groundwater samples collected at an aquifer in Colorado. The effort was led by researchers from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley. DNA sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. As reported online October 24 in the journal Nature Communications , the scientists netted genomes from 80 percent of all known bacterial phyla, a remarkable degree of biological diversity at one location. They also discovered 47 new phylum-level bacterial groups , naming many of them after influential microbiologists and other scientists. And they learned new insights about how microbial communities work together to drive processes that are critical to the planet’s climate and life everywhere, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles. These findings shed light on one of Earth’s most important and least understood realms of life. The subterranean world hosts up to one-fifth of all biomass, but it remains a mystery. “We didn’t expect to find this incredible microbial diversity. But then again, we know little about the roles of subsurface microbes in biogeochemical processes, and more broadly, we don’t really know what’s down there,” says Jill Banfield, a Senior Faculty Scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Climate & Ecosystem Sciences Division and a UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science, and Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. UC Berkeley’s Karthik Anantharaman, the first author of the paper, adds, “To better understand what subsurface microbes are up to, our approach is to access their entire genomes. This enabled us to discover a greater interdependency among microbes than we’ve seen before.” The research is part of a Berkeley Lab-led project called Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area 2.0, which is developing a predictive understanding of terrestrial environments from the genome to the watershed scale. The project’s field research takes place at a research site near the town of Rifle, Colorado, where for the past several years scientists have conducted experiments designed to stimulate populations of subterranean microbes that are naturally present in very low numbers. The scientists sent soil and water samples from these experiments to the Joint Genome Institute for terabase-scale metagenomic sequencing. This high-throughput method isolates and purifies DNA from environmental samples, and then sequences one trillion base pairs of DNA at a time. Next, the scientists used bioinformatics tools developed in Banfield’s lab to analyze the data. Their approach has redrawn the tree of life. Between the 47 new bacterial groups reported in this work, and 35 new groups published last year (also found at the Rifle site), Banfield’s team has doubled the number of known bacterial groups. With discovery comes naming rights. The scientists named many of the new bacteria groups after Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley researchers. For example, there’s Candidatus Andersenbacteria, after phylochip inventor Gary Andersen, and there’s Candidatus Doudnabacteria, after CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna. “Berkeley now dominates the tree of life as it does the periodic table,” Banfield says, in a nod to the sixteen elements discovered at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley. Another big outcome is a deeper understanding of the roles subsurface microbes play in globally important carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles . This information will help to better represent these cycles in predictive models such as climate simulations. The scientists conducted metabolic analyses of 36 percent of the organisms detected in the aquifer system. They focused on a phenomenon called metabolic handoff, which essentially means one microbe’s waste is another microbe’s food. It’s known from lab studies that handoffs are needed in certain reactions, but these interconnected networks are widespread and vastly more complex in the real world. To understand why it’s important to represent metabolic handoffs as accurately as possible in models, consider nitrate, a groundwater contaminant from fertilizers. Subsurface microbes are the primary driver in reducing nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. There are four steps in this denitrification process, and the third step creates nitrous oxide—one of the most potent greenhouse gases. The process breaks down if microbes that carry out the fourth step are inactive when a pulse of nitrate enters the system. “If microbes aren’t there to accept the nitrous oxide handoff, then the greenhouse gas escapes into the atmosphere,” says Anantharaman. The scientists found the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles are all driven by metabolic handoffs that require an unexpectedly high degree of interdependence among microbes. The vast majority of microorganisms can’t fully reduce a compound on their own. It takes a team. There are also backup microbes ready to perform a handoff if first-string microbes are unavailable. “The combination of high microbial diversity and interconnections through metabolic handoffs likely results in high ecosystem resilience ,” says Banfield.",1

However, the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States seems to have brought some change to this dangerous situation.Trump and Putin vow to fight Islamic State together The president -elect and the Russian President Vladimir Putin have confirmed that they have had a healthy and productive conversation regarding relations between the countries and their shared purpose in tackling global terrorism. The telephone call was instigated by Putin who wanted to express his congratulations to Trump after he took the top job in American politics. During the conversation, Putin is reported to have said that he is ready to pick up a dialogue with officials from the United States “by mutual respect, non-intervention into each other’s internal affairs”.The two men agreed during their brief telephone call that they would lay the groundwork to bring in a new era of Russia-American cooperation. According to a source, Putin and Trump have agreed to “work to channel bilateral relationships into constructive cooperation, to combine efforts to tackle international terrorism and extremism, and to continue contact by telephone and to work towards meeting in person” . Trump’s office continued with this optimism and placatory stance saying: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.""In a follow-up statement, a Kremlin spokesperson said that the United States and Russia were planning to work together in both trade and economics as well as the threat posed by international terrorist organizations such as Islamic State. The fight against Islamic State may prove to be of essential importance in the coming months as top Islamic State commanders have already expressed their intention to exploit Donald Trump’s outspoken opinions on ordinary Muslims. Islamic commander Abu Omar Khorasani has said that Trump’s words have played directly into the hands of the terrorist organization. He said; ""This guy is a complete maniac. His utter hate towards Muslims will make our job much easier because we can recruit thousands."" Disclose TV SOURCE ",1

426,"ISTANBUL  —   Turkey’s quarrel with Europe worsened over the weekend after the Turkish president accused the Dutch government of Nazism, and Turkish politicians were barred or disinvited from events in two European countries, amid tensions ahead of a tight referendum on a new Turkish Constitution. Having criticized German officials for barring their Turkish counterparts from campaign events this month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan turned his ire on the Netherlands after the Dutch stopped the Turkish foreign minister from landing there for a rally on Saturday, and then escorted the Turkish family minister out of the country early on Sunday, citing risks to public order and security. It was an unusually strong reaction from the Dutch, who have generally taken an open stance toward diverse points of view, but who are in the midst of an election campaign in which immigration and integration are major topics. “When those incidents began, I said those are fascistic measures,” Mr. Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday afternoon. “I said Nazism had risen from the dead. And then I added: I thought Nazism was over, but I was wrong. ” The   remarks from Turkey inflamed tensions among the Turkish community in the Netherlands, who protested in Rotterdam until the early hours of Sunday, when they were dispersed by police officers wielding batons and water cannons. The police arrested 12 people, and seven were injured, including a policeman, whose hand was broken. Though Turkish law technically bars the practice, Turkish ministers are touring Europe to persuade the Continent’s sizable Turkish diaspora to vote yes to an expansion of Mr. Erdogan’s powers, amid fears that the “no” campaign may hold the edge in the April referendum. But this campaign has collided with closely fought local elections in the Netherlands and France, where   politicians have sought political capital from stoking tensions with the Turks. The push for votes also comes at a time of increased European alarm over Turkey’s democratic backslide and rising concerns over immigration and integration. The Dutch government said it refused to allow the Turkish foreign minister’s plane to land after the Turkish government publicly called on “Dutch nationals of Turkish origin to turn out in great numbers. ” The two countries were negotiating over finding a smaller venue like the Turkish Consulate to hold the meeting, but “before these talks had been concluded,” Turkey “publicly threatened the Netherlands with sanctions” making a “reasonable compromise” impossible, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said. Elsewhere in Europe, the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, canceled a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Binali Yildirim, in protest of Turkey’s “rhetorical attacks. ” In Sweden, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan’s party, Mehdi Eker, rearranged a campaign event after the meeting’s initial hosts backed out for safety reasons. In France, two   candidates, François Fillon and Marine Le Pen, criticized the decision to allow the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to proceed with a rally in France. Switzerland and Austria have previously made it clear that Mr. Erdogan’s campaign is unwelcome there. In the Netherlands, both the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte, and his   opponent, Geert Wilders, hoped to benefit from the dispute, though it was not immediately clear if either would see appreciable gains. The election is on Wednesday, and while it was Mr. Wilders who first elevated the issue publicly, Mr. Rutte could get credit for barring the Turkish ministers. “Rutte now has premier bonus,” said Bianca Pander, a political strategist at BKB, which works on campaign strategy, referring to his status as prime minister. “He can now show what leadership means. ” He is also benefiting from nearly constant news media coverage on the issue. “Rutte is in the picture now: He’s on every TV show, and on every newspaper,” Ms. Pander said. Mr. Rutte said the pejoratives leveled at the Dutch were “bizarre” and that the “Turkish republic is moving in the wrong direction for a democracy. ” In response, Mr. Erdogan accused the   Dutch government of playing to a domestic audience by blocking his ministers. “Holland, if you are sacrificing   relations because of the election on Wednesday, you will pay the price,” Mr. Erdogan said Sunday. Inside Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, too, was accused of trying to curry favor with the country’s voters. With the referendum result in doubt, some of the president’s critics argued that he was manufacturing fights with Europe to win the support of nationalists in Turkey who were undecided about whether to back the expansion of his mandate. “Turkish foreign policy today  —   whatever it is, wherever it is, from Syria all the way to the Netherlands and Germany  —   is related to the domestic political agenda,” said Cengiz Candar, a veteran Turkish columnist and academic. “There is no Turkish foreign policy now,” Mr. Candar added in a telephone interview. “Turkish foreign policy is related to Mr. Erdogan’s referendum campaign. ” But others supported Mr. Erdogan’s stance. The leader of the main Turkish opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is against the proposed Constitution, called on Mr. Erdogan to suspend relations with the Netherlands. A small crowd of   protesters gathered outside the Dutch Consulate in Istanbul, while an unknown intruder briefly managed to replace the consulate’s Dutch flag with a Turkish one. In a province west of the city, another crowd of protesters squeezed a series of oranges, in a theatrical gesture apparently intended to insult the Dutch, whose national color is orange. Arriving back in Turkey after her deportation, the Turkish family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, accused the Netherlands of hypocrisy for claiming to stand up for human rights while restricting her own. “We faced a very inhumane, unethical treatment,” she said at Istanbul’s main airport, according to Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. “We had a really very painful night in Holland, which talks about democracy, freedoms, freedom of speech. ” In addition to targeting wavering members of Mr. Erdogan’s own party, some analysts said the Turkish government’s movements in Europe were particularly aimed at supporters of the country’s largest nationalist movement, the Nationalist Movement Party, which is known in Turkey as the M. H. P. The M. H. P. has traditionally been wary of Mr. Erdogan, but its leadership now supports giving him more power, in the private expectation that its own cadres will subsequently be rewarded with more influence. While an estimated three million German residents are of Turkish origin, as well as about 400, 000 Dutch residents, the number of people in Germany and the Netherlands who are eligible to vote in the Turkish elections is far lower, said Alexander Clarkson, a specialist on the Turkish diaspora at King’s College London. Mr. Erdogan’s recent gestures were therefore primarily targeted at the M. H. P. ’s rank and file in Turkey, many of whom are skeptical of their leadership’s alliance with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Clarkson said. “The audience isn’t really the diaspora the audience is at home,” Mr. Clarkson said of the government’s stance toward the Netherlands and Germany. The heated language helps achieve this goal, Mr. Clarkson said, since “it enables Erdogan and the A. K. P. to say: We are out there protecting the rights of Turks abroad. ” The A. K. P. is an acronym for Mr. Erdogan’s group, the Justice and Development Party. Mr. Erdogan was accused of hypocrisy for criticizing Europe’s perceived authoritarianism while overseeing a sweeping crackdown on dissent in his country. Since a failed coup in July, Mr. Erdogan’s government has ruled mostly by decree, allowing it to suspend or fire more than 120, 000 government employees, and arrest an estimated 45, 000 people suspected of being dissidents or rebels. The detainees come from a broad section of public life and include soldiers, police officers, teachers, judges, academics, journalists and lawmakers. “He is the president of a country,” Mr. Candar said of Mr. Erdogan, “where more than 150 journalists,   writers, columnists, opinion makers are in prison. And the leaders of the   caucus in the Turkish Parliament”  —   as well as 12 other members of Parliament who belong to it  —   “are also in prison. ” Turkey, Mr. Candar argued, “has transformed into a republic of fear. ”",0

428,"One of the more interesting lessons Democrats may learn in their newfound enthusiasm for George Orwell’s Nineteen    —   which is a critique of socialism, but never mind  —   is the way that totalitarian societies destroy intimate relationships. [In the dystopian future envisioned by Orwell, children betray their parents to the Thought Police, and sex is discouraged because it creates relationships outside the state. A secret love is the most revolutionary act  —   and, ultimately, a futile one.  Today, in the United States, we are witnesses to  —   and participants in  —   the destruction of friendships and relationships over political disputes that rage uncontrollably on social media, carry over into the workplace, and even continue into the home. A few weeks ago, a   poll revealed that 39% of Americans had argued about politics with friends and family, and   had “stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election. ” True, 40% of respondents said they had not had those kinds of arguments, but that may also be because Americans are increasingly withdrawing into political camps. It is fashionable, especially in Washington, to blame these divisions on an increasingly partisan media. And that is partly true. Orwell observed  —   separately, in 1944  —   that modern innovations in communication and travel had inspired new ways to divide people, rather than bringing the world together. Of radio, for example, he observed: “It is nonsense to say that the radio puts people in touch with foreign countries   …     each national radio is a sort of totalitarian world of its own, braying propaganda night and day to people who can listen to nothing else. ” The same is true of social media and domestic politics today. Theoretically, Facebook and Twitter ought to make it easier for us to communicate with, and understand, people with different views. In practice, they encourage us to huddle with   people and sever relations with the other side. Twitter is the most brutal of social media platforms, because it allows people to bash each other from behind pseudonyms and avatars. But Facebook is even more damaging, because it takes   associations  —   families, schools, towns  —   and exposes them to the ravages of intense political debate. On Twitter, we form alliances with strangers who agree with us on Facebook, we discover the opposing political views of people with whom we may have shared close lifelong connections. Social media platforms are increasingly important sources of news. And so the new political divisions in the world of journalism are filtering into our social media, which in turn exacerbates those media divisions in a seemingly endless feedback loop. But the media are not solely responsible. The deliberate politicization of intimacy began with a specific campaign  —   namely, President Barack Obama’s 2008 run, which used social media technology to drive a political message. Obama told his supporters explicitly to approach their neighbors and “argue with them, and get in their face. ” His surrogates took that approach even further. Hollywood celebrity Sarah Silverman encouraged Obama’s Jewish supporters to travel to Florida and tell their ostensibly racist grandparents to vote for him. Later, once Obama was in office, the supposedly   Rock the Vote organization told young people to withhold sex from partners who refused to support Obamacare. The politicization of intimacy has been a Democratic campaign strategy ever since. And after the 2016 election, it has only continued. Anecdotally, conservative acquantances report that their (understandably) frustrated and (irrationally) fearful liberal Facebook friends have tried to hold them personally responsible for every perceived misstep by President Donald Trump. As much as conservatives disliked Barack Obama and his policies, that kind of behavior seemed far less common. Just recently, a friend posted on Facebook: “I got blocked by a liberal tonight. My brother. ” This quiet dissolution of American social life should worry us, for the simple reason that the intimate connections among neighbors, family, and friends are the glue that holds our otherwise individualistic society together. Alexis de Tocqueville noted in Democracy in America, nearly 200 years ago, that our system functions because of the overlapping associations we form with one another. Those are at risk. Fifteen years ago, Americans were deeply divided over the results of the 2000 presidential election and the Florida recount. It took the horrific events of September 11th, 2001 to bring the nation together. One hopes it does not take a similar event this time. This week, in addressing Congress, President Trump united the nation in applauding and comforting the widow of a fallen Navy SEAL. It was a rare moment of unity, a reminder that we can  —   and must  —   renew what we still hold in common. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

429,"From a single gust of wind, Clare Hollingworth reaped the journalistic scoop of the century. Ms. Hollingworth, the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, who died on Tuesday in Hong Kong at 105, was less than a week into her first job, as a reporter for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, on that windy day in 1939. Driving alone on the road from Gleiwitz, then in Germany, to Katowice, in Poland  —   a distance of less than 20 miles  —   she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view. Through the opening, Ms. Hollingworth saw, she later wrote, “large numbers of troops, literally hundreds of tanks, armored cars and field guns” concealed in the valley. She knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion. Hastening back across the border to the Polish side, she telephoned her editor with the news, a world exclusive. The date was Aug. 28, 1939, and her article, published the next day, would become, as the British paper The Guardian wrote in 2015, “probably the greatest scoop of modern times. ” On Sept. 1, Hitler’s forces invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II. For the next four decades, Ms. Hollingworth (who over the years contributed articles to The Telegraph, The Guardian, The International Herald Tribune and The Wall Street Journal) covered World War II from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and North Africa the Greek and Algerian civil wars hostilities between Arabs and Jews in the waning days of the British mandate in Palestine and the Vietnam War, among other conflicts. Often under fire, occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy  —   both by local governments and by the British  —   Ms. Hollingworth was friend, or foe, to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury. She obtained the first interview with Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after he became the shah of Iran in 1941, and what was very likely among the last, after he was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. In 1965, wanting to cover hostilities between India and Pakistan but discovering that reporters were barred from the front, she simply secured permission from an old acquaintance, Indira Gandhi, who was then India’s minister of information and broadcasting. Ms. Hollingworth was also one of the first Western journalists to report regularly from China, opening The Telegraph’s Beijing bureau in 1973. Her other major scoops included a 1963 article for The Guardian in which she cautiously identified the British intelligence agent Kim Philby as the   “third man” in the ring of Soviet spies then known to include the Englishmen Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. Another was a 1968 article for The Telegraph in which she reported the United States’ incipient plans for peace talks with Vietnam. (The talks opened in Paris later that year and were concluded in 1973.) Ms. Hollingworth was never so happy, she often said, as when she was roaming the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. Embedded long before the term was applied to journalists, she slept in trucks and in trenches, at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights. She once held off an armed Algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe. Had her eyesight not begun to fail some 20 years ago, it was a life, Ms. Hollingworth made clear, that she would gladly have continued to the end of her days. “I must admit that I enjoy being in a war,” she told The Telegraph in 2011, on the eve of her 100th birthday. In 1989, though nearly 80 and nominally retired, Ms. Hollingworth, attired in a safari suit, her working uniform of choice for 60 years, was spotted in Tiananmen Square shinnying up a lamppost for a bird’  view of the government’s violent crackdown against civilian protesters. She periodically slept on the floor of her home in Hong Kong well into her 90s, just to keep from going soft. Through all her travels, with all their attendant rigors, there was only one thing, Ms. Hollingworth said, that she truly could not abide. “I do not mind not washing for a week or more,” she wrote, “but I do hate getting fleas in my hair. ” Her Graham Greene existence, with its typewriter, revolver and most particularly its fleas, was a far cry from the life her conventional,   British parents had envisioned for her  —   one of quiet propriety, dutiful wifehood, charity balls and hunting. Clare Hollingworth was born on Oct. 10, 1911, in Knighton in central England, outside Leicester. As a child, she enjoyed touring the historic battlefields of England and France with her father, who ran the family’s boot and shoe factory. At her parents’ insistence, the young Ms. Hollingworth attended domestic science college in Leicester, an experience that did nothing to make the prospect of hearth and home attractive. (“Although it is useful to be able to make an omelet,” she later wrote, “my domestic science training caused me to hate having anything to do with housework. ”) Partly in deference to her upbringing, she became engaged “to a suitable young man,” though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist. “My mother thought journalism frightfully low, like a trade,” Ms. Hollingworth said in the 2011 interview with The Telegraph. “She didn’t believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen’s entrance. ” In the 1930s, Ms. Hollingworth attended the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London and afterward studied at the University of Zagreb, then in Yugoslavia. Working for the League of Nations Union, a peace and social justice group established in Britain in 1918, she was dispatched to Warsaw. There, in early 1939, she aided thousands of refugees from the Sudetenland  —   the region of Czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the Nazis in October 1938  —   arranging travel documents that would let them cross into Poland. She wrote about their plight for small publications in Britain. The Telegraph learned of Ms. Hollingworth’s work in Poland, and on Aug. 25, 1939, while she was visiting London, it hired her as a correspondent. Assigned to cover the prelude to war in the region, she flew to Warsaw the next day. From Warsaw she traveled to Katowice, commandeering an official car from the British consul general there. It was in that car, Union Jack boldly flying, that she drove over the border, past astonished Nazi guards and into Germany on Aug. 28. Ms. Hollingworth’s scoop comprised two parts. The first was her story of Aug. 29, about the advent of war. The second was her report on the start of the war itself. Awakened by explosions at dawn on Sept. 1, Ms. Hollingworth, from her quarters in Katowice, saw German bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance. She telephoned a friend at the British Embassy in Warsaw. “The war has begun!” she cried. “Are you sure, old girl?” he said. Her published article notwithstanding, Ms. Hollingworth later wrote, British officialdom persisted in thinking that war remained weeks away. She held the receiver out the window as German tanks roared outside. The embassy was persuaded and soon, too, was her editor. Ms. Hollingworth’s article on the start of hostilities appeared in The Telegraph the next day. Her work from this period is unbylined  —   few reporters were accorded bylines then  —   a state of affairs she pronounced as being for the best: It simultaneously spared her parents familial anxiety and social indignity. What followed was more than 40 years of chasing danger, for it was in the most dangerous places, Ms. Hollingworth often said, that the best stories lay. Traveling with British troops in North Africa, she was buried in the sands for the night when she awoke to the sounds of a German reconnaissance party. “A sneeze would have brought death to us all,” she later wrote. She held her breath in the darkness, and the party passed unseeing. In Vietnam, a sniper’s bullet narrowly missed her head. Ms. Hollingworth’s first husband, Vandeleur Robinson, whom she married in 1936, divorced her for desertion 15 years later. (“When I’m on a story, I’m on a story  —   to hell with husband, family, anyone else,” she told The Guardian in 2004.) Her second husband, Geoffrey Hoare, a journalist whom she married in the early 1950s, died in 1965. Her death was confirmed by Patrick Garrett, her grandnephew and her biographer. Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Hilary Sandre. Over time, some members of the British press grew alienated by what they saw as Ms. Hollingworth’s imperious manner. “Ms. Hollingworth’s snobberies are very tiring, her cozy relations with British embassies irritating,” the English journalist Robert Fisk wrote, reviewing her 1990 memoir, “Front Line. ” But she remained a widely admired, even venerated, figure, a recipient of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and a perennial fixture at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong, where she had made her home since the early 1980s. Her other books include “The Three Weeks’ War in Poland” (1940) “There’s a German Just Behind Me” (1942) “The Arabs and the West” (1952) and “Mao and the Men Against Him” (1985). As Ms. Hollingworth made clear in later interviews, though there was no dearth of wars to accompany her old age, she did not truly expect to be called upon to cover them. Yet to the end of her life she slept with her passport and a pair of shoes within easy reach, just in case.",0
430,"A black man said the police in North Miami, Fla. shot him on Monday as he tried to help a patient with autism who had run away from the group home where he works. The man, Charles Kinsey, 47, who identified himself as a caretaker of the patient, was on a city street with the patient when officers arrived, a lawyer for Mr. Kinsey said. When the officers drew their weapons, Mr. Kinsey told them there was no need for firearms, lay down in the middle of the street and tried to explain what had happened, the lawyer said. The video shows him trying to calm the patient, urging him to sit and to lie down. “All he has is a toy truck  —   a toy truck,” Mr. Kinsey said, according to video obtained by the Miami television station WSVN. “I am a behavior therapist at a group home,” he added. But then an officer opened fire, striking Mr. Kinsey in the leg. The North Miami police did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment on Thursday. The North Miami police chief, Gary Eugene, who held a news conference on Thursday, said an investigation would be led by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Chief Eugene said, “The law requires us to gather every fact and resolve every question. ” No gun was recovered at the scene, he added. On Friday, North Miami leaders identified the officer as Jonathan Aledda, a member of the SWAT team, and said he had been placed on administrative leave without pay, according to The Miami Herald. Another officer was also placed on leave for allegedly giving misleading statements during the inquiry. In a preliminary statement Tuesday, the North Miami Police Department said officers had responded to a call about “an armed male suspect threatening suicide. ” “Arriving officers attempted to negotiate with the two men on the scene, one of whom was later identified as suffering from autism,” the statement said. “At some point during the   negotiation, one of the responding officers discharged his weapon. The video shows Mr. Kinsey in a   and shorts with his back on the ground and his hands in the air. Seated next to him on a street is another man, who Mr. Kinsey says is the patient he was trying to help. Mr. Kinsey tried to defuse the situation, his lawyer, Hilton Napoleon, said. “He asked the police officer, ‘Why did you shoot me?’ He told my client, ‘I don’t know,’” Mr. Napoleon said. Clint Bower, the president and chief executive of MACtown Inc. where Mr. Kinsey works, expressed frustration at how the police responded, but praised Mr. Kinsey for his actions. “Needless to say, after viewing the video, my employee Charles Kinsey, behavioral support professional, is a hero. He saved the    young man with autism from being shot,” Mr. Bower said in an email on Wednesday. “He put his own life at risk, which is evident in the video. ” Mr. Napoleon said he met with city officials on Wednesday and had discussed the possibility of a settlement. Whatever the resolution, he said, the city should start by censuring the officer. “The best thing that the City of North Miami can do is come out and condemn the officer,” he said. . In a statement on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said: “We have to stem the tide of violence, both nationwide and here in Florida. It starts with holding people accountable for their actions. There must be a thorough and independent investigation into this shooting that covers both whether officers violated internal use of deadly force policies and whether criminal charges should be brought. ”",0
431," The Path to Total Dictatorship: America's Shadow Government and Its Silent CoupBy John W. Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state . The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government . This group is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable. Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.Say hello to Americas shadow government.A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe. COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstancesa terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdownto bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.Yet it is the second shadow government also referred to as the Deep Statethat poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government.The Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power, makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.So who or what is the Deep State?Its the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. Its the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies : the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.Its every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.These are the key players that drive the shadow government.This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.Domestic surveillance.No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether youre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alikeincluding homes. Coupled with the nations growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.Global spying.The NSAs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion  espionage empire , will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage .Roving TSA searches.The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.USA Patriot Act, NDAA.Americas so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.Militarized police state.Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, Americas law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.SWAT team raids.With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.Domestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.School-to-prison pipeline.The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.Overcriminalization.The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.Privatized Prisons.States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.Endless wars.Americas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.Are you getting the message yet?The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going on.As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue , is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.The Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater) and Silicon Valley.This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.As Lofgren concludes:[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officialselected and unelected alikeare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by Americas shadow government.Constitutional attorney and author John W.

432,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself Americans are today being given a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. According to experts, today’s vote is less an opportunity to select the leader of the free world, so much as the chance to remind Donald Trump what an arsehole they all think he is. Democratic countries around the globe are today united in telling Americans they have a unique chance to show the world that they have the ability to guide a leading nation in the direction of societal harmony, equality for all, and telling racists to go fuck themselves. US political expert, Chuck Williams, told us, “Setting the persuasive policy arguments made by the candidates to one side, the United States will wake on Wednesday morning to either of two plausible realities. “One in which the downcast misogynist billionaire leader has been roundly told to fuck the fuck off, or another in which he enjoys a prolonged, ill-tempered orgasm on the Fox News network.” Williams urged Americans to imagine a forward-looking country in which Donald Trump isn’t constantly forced to appear on the news in order to defend himself against accusation after inevitable accusation of improper behaviour, both privately and professionally. He concluded, “You can either offer a number of quiet ‘fuck you’s at him many, many times over the next four years, or you can give him one enormous one today. “Choose wisely.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

433,"Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations. On Friday, Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force, and the mayor said he would negotiate a   settlement, known as a consent decree. But that is no guarantee of results  —   and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing reports choking with outrage. Los Angeles, which was under a consent decree for 11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. “Los Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank. In Detroit, which emerged from a   consent decree last year, officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly. But Pittsburgh, the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a “pattern and practice” of misconduct, later backslid after changes in leadership, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement, the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms, underscoring some experts’ view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements. Last year, Miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision, training and internal investigations. The “pattern and practice” approach developed after the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable. A jury’s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on Mr. King incited deadly riots. Since the early attempts, Mr. Walker said, consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive. “The general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues,” he said, “but I don’t think there’s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before. ” Still, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general under   Donald J. Trump, called them “dangerous,” writing in 2008 that they “constitute an end run around the democratic process. ” At his confirmation hearing this past week, he softened that critique, saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced. But, Mr. Sessions said, lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,” he said. His critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work. But experts say that even systemic changes, like greater oversight of officers’ use of force, can be slow to yield results. “They change the ‘inputs’ through training, record keeping, community involvement and other internal reforms, but the inputs don’t necessarily translate into changes in ‘outputs’ including racial disparities, use of force, or other constitutional issues,” wrote Jeff Fagan, a Columbia University law professor, in an email. “The results have been quite variable. ” Consent decrees can span years and many of the Obama administration’s key settlements have just begun, including those in Cleveland and Albuquerque. So it would be premature to assess their success. Some reform advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees, robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change. Even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees. Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said that a consent decree would aid community relations. Charles H. Ramsey, who as Washington’s police chief invited the Justice Department to review his department, said, “The DOJ gives legitimacy to the changes that you’re making. ” Chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change, as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms. Mr. Sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy. “Such decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money,” he wrote. “Thus, the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process. ”",0

435,"BLACKPOOL, England  —   “Ramones forever!” C. J. Ramone yelled to a tightly packed crowd at the Rebellion Festival here earlier this month, and a little roar rippled through a sea of   mohawks,   spikes  —   and more than a few balding heads. It was 40 years ago this summer that the Ramones flew to London and played a July 4 concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, an event that many cite as the moment that punk rock first took flight in Britain. A month earlier, a   London group called the Sex Pistols had played a gig at Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. It has been said that there were only a few dozen people in attendance, but every one went out and started a band. “I’ve said this quote before, but I’ll say it again,” Steve Diggle of the Buzzcocks said in a recent interview over a pint of Guinness in London. “If Jesus was born in Bethlehem, British punk was born in Manchester at that gig. ” The anniversary of that summer is being celebrated in Punk London, a citywide, yearlong series of exhibitions, talks and concerts supported by the mayor’s office and the National Lottery. Proving, perhaps, that punk’s rebellious spirit hasn’t yet receded into rock’s history books, this institutional endorsement of an   movement has drawn skepticism, a little bit of ridicule and even some mild acts of resistance. “We heard our song on BBC News,” as part of the anniversary celebrations, Noel Martin, 61, of the band Menace, which formed in the   said outside the Blackpool festival grounds. The song, “G. L. C. ,” which stood for Greater London Council, took aim at the city government, whose conservative members had called for a ban on punk concerts. “BBC banned that song 40 years ago, how come they’re playing it now?” In March, Joe Corré, the son of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and the Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren, vowed to burn 5 million pounds, or about $6. 46 million, worth of punk memorabilia to protest what he saw as the   of the movement. (The event, which is planned for this fall, was promptly added by a City Hall staff member to the Punk London website). In July, the singer Viv Albertine of the band the Slits visited the British Library for a talk connected to Punk London. While there, she stopped by the institution’s punk history exhibition to scrawl over the names of prominent female punk artists in permanent marker onto to the show’s signage. “What about the women! !” she wrote on a sign, crossing out the names of male punk groups and replacing them with   acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees and   Spex. The concerts of the summer of ’76 proved a crucible: In the months that followed, punk broke into public consciousness across Britain. The Clash, the Buzzcocks and the Damned gained nationwide attention. And the Sex Pistols became tabloid sensations, both for their wild behavior and their   lyrics, particularly for “God Save the Queen,” an   screed that suggested the queen was the head of a “fascist regime. ” The reaction from the news media was swift: Sex Pistols tracks, including “Queen” and “Anarchy in the U. K.,” were banned from the BBC, and, after reports that band members had spit on and yelled at staff at Heathrow Airport, the Pistols were dropped from their record label, EMI. The Sex Pistols dissolved in spectacular fashion months later, but the Ramones soldiered on for another 20 years (C. J. Ramone joined the band in the late ’80s). Fans and musicians at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, a resort town on the Irish Sea, noted the incongruity of the establishment’s embracing of punk rock, but they said the British punk scene was vibrant and even growing. “We go to gigs every week here, Manchester, Birmingham,” Graham Norris, 51, a fan of punk, said over a hot dog on the first day of the festival. “There’s lots of good bands coming through, a lot of them,” said Mr. Norris, who carried a cane and had a single synthetic green dreadlock threaded onto his last wisp of natural hair. “Maybe their dads were punks, maybe their mothers were punks and they’ve picked up on it. ” This festival’s lineup reflected that intergenerational spirit: Early bands like Agnostic Front and the Buzzcocks split the bill with newer acts like Youth Man and Angry Itch. Outside the main venue, a group of young punk fans gathered on a stoop, smoking and swigging from liquor bottles. One young musician, Connor MacPherson, 18, whose band the Antiseptics played at Punk Weekender, a   concert series held at the Roundhouse in July to commemorate the anniversary of the Ramones concert, said that the punk spirit was particularly relevant now that conservatives control Britain’s government. Describing himself as a “socialist with anarchist tendencies,” Mr. MacPherson got a rousing response from the others when he lobbed a shot at David Cameron, the former prime minister. “We have got a government that doesn’t care about the youth, that doesn’t care about the   people,” he said. “We need punk more than ever  —   we need punk more than they needed it in 1977. ” Nella Bellinzoni, 62, was selling bags and   sweaters in the halls of the festival. With blue hair sprayed vertical and reaching about a foot above her head (she said it took her around one and a half cans of hair spray and three hours to achieve the look) Ms. Bellinzoni, who described herself as an “old punk, from the beginning,” expressed a sunny vision of punk’s future. “It’s getting more and more stronger,” Ms. Bellinzoni, a native of Italy who lives near Blackpool, said. “All the kids, when their father or mother was punk, then they’re punk as well. ” One   duo was Simon Reynolds, 50, who took a train from London to Blackpool and his    son, Oscar. Mr. Reynolds, who started listening to punk in the early ’80s, said he thought that the movement had cleaned up its act somewhat since the early years and grown a “conscience. ” Oscar, with spiky green hair and a   advertising the punk band Gnarwolves, said he became interested in punk about eight years ago, through skateboarding and through his father. He said that he appreciated the sympathy for the working classes, and also that he liked that the music was different from what his friends listened to. Asked whether he ever felt strange dabbling in the same music scene as his father, he looked briefly incredulous. “No, no,” he said with a chuckle, before his face got serious and he added, “My dad’s rad. ”",0
436,"Lukas Mikelionis, Heat Street, October 24, 2016 {snip} According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. In a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn’t picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed “we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.” “But I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative–and that narrative is about, to be blunt, it’s about theft and genocide”, the professor said. {snip} “It’s not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age . . . Certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society. They’re frequently highly educated people. They’re almost completely white,” she said. CBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: “Should we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?” To which the academic replied: “Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.” {snip} Either way, somebody should break the news to Canada’s woke Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about this. It’s 2016, after all. Thrilled to let you know we’re going to need another seat in our canoe: Sophie is pregnant! #threeisthenewtwo pic.twitter.com/gm76BwAe4p",1
437,"Email Following the surprisingly strong electoral victory of Donald Trump to the White House in this year’s presidential election, a spokesperson for a group founded to revive the rejected 2007 DREAM Atct — which would have granted amnesty to minors illegally in the United States — pledged to resist mass deportation of illegal aliens. The spokesperson also called Border Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel ""agents of racism.” In a statement quoted by the Washington Times , Cristina Jimenez, co-founder of United We Dream (which describes itself as “the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation”) said: “Immigrants are declaring a state of urgency and resilience. Over the coming weeks, our families and community members will need to tap into the incredible strength that brought us to this country and which we use to survive.” In her statement, Jimenez not only expressed dismay at the election of Trump but also castigated the agents of the federal agencies charged with protecting our borders. “All people with love in our hearts are angered and disappointed tonight and pledge to resist mass deportation,” she said. “ICE and CBP have proven themselves to be agents of racism and agents of hate.” Both the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council — the two unions that represent Border Patrol and ICE agents, respectively, had announced endorsements of Trump during the presidential campaign. We reported in our article last April that the NBPC’s leaders — including Brandon Judd, the union’s president; Kenneth Palinkas, its past president; Shawn Moran; the union’s vice president; and Chris Cabrera, a spokesperson for the NBPC’s Rio Grande Valley council — have all been vocal in criticizing the Obama administration’s lack of enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws. The NBPC issued a press release on March 30 that stated part of the reason for its endorsement of Trump: Mr. Trump is correct when he says immigration wouldn’t be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadn’t made some bold and necessary statements. And when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of a man. When the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States. The union representing the nation’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff, the ICE Council, endorsed Trump last September. Their endorsement statement noted: Donald Trump reached out to us for a meeting, sat down with me to discuss his goals for enforcement, and pledged to support ICE officers, our nation’s laws and our members. In his immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security— including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory detainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. A notice on the United We Dream website stated that when the DREAM Act failed to get 60 votes in the Senate in 2007, a “group of DREAMers, organizers, and advocates came together to reflect on the DREAM Act campaign and talk about building a movement and organization that would not hinge on votes in Congress.” President Obama, frustrated that the DREAM Act (the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) had repeatedly failed to pass, had already decided to bypass Congress by creating the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to allow youth who had brought into the country illegally by their parents as children immigrants to work legally in the United States. Critics of DACA have pointed out that the program is a means to circumvent Congress and grant amnesty to those who reside here illegally. The DACA program was created in 2012 via policy memo by then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. In 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson further expanded the DACA program by removing its age cap and extending the work authorization to three years. Subsequently a group of states challenged this executive action in the case of State of Texas, et al v United States, et al. The DACA program was brought to a halt after U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas responded to the plaintiff states by issuing an order of temporary injunction to block the federal government from implementing the Obama administration’s policy memorandums that expanded DACA and implemented the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. The Obama administration appealed Hanen’s ruing in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. After the court issued a tied 8-8 decision on the appeal, Hanen’s injunction was allowed to stand. With the election of Donald Trump, it is expected that the new president will issue an executive order of his own to reverse those issued by Obama administration officials to create DACA. It is the anticipation of this move that has groups such as United We Dream worried. Related articles:",1

In a series of tweets and ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/cdc-scientist-confirms-donald-trump-is.html Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and interviews over the past few years, the presidential candidate has stated that he strongly believes that there is a link between ""monstrous"" vaccines and autism . He has suggested that delivering vaccines in smaller doses over time could reduce autism rates among U.S. children. Despite being cast to the lunatic fringe by the mainstream media for his remarks, CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson has confirmed Trump's suspicions — namely, that   autism is real .Congressman Bill Posey from Florida helped expose the corruption of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . He recently read a statement on the House floor written by CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson.In the statement, Dr. Thompson admitted to omitting data from a study which showed that autism rates were higher among African American boys who received the MMR vaccination before the age of three.(1) ""Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about their children's health deserve to have the best information available to them. ""They should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth. For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor,"" Posey stated.(2) He then proceeded to read the statement provided by Dr. Thompson. The statement pertained to a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics. The doctor revealed that he and his colleagues intentionally destroyed data in the study which showed that African American MMR-vaccinated boys under the age of three had   for autism. According to the whistleblower, the CDC held a meeting of scientists to discuss whether they should destroy the evidence. The authors decided to scrap their findings. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved computer files and hard copies of the omitted data for legal reasons.(3) ""Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to insure that the documents that Dr. Thompson are not ignored. Therefore I will provide them to members of Congress and the House Committees upon request. ""Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted,"" Posey concluded.(2) Because the report pertains to vaccines, the mainstream media continues to ignore these revelations. Meanwhile, they continue to parade Donald Trump as a kook for suggesting that there is a link   The double standard boggles the mind and sickens the stomach.Trump hasn't backed down from the vaccine debate despite the mainstream media's backlash against his remarks. In 2015, he appeared on the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show stating: ""I've known people that had totally magnificent children, functioning a hundred percent, everything beautiful, smart as a whip, and they go for this shot and get this shot of this massive dose, of everything at one time, and they end up with horrible autism.""(4) In addition, Trump stated on a Fox News television program in 2012: ""I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.""(5) Trump made similar remarks in a series of tweets in 2014, after a CDC report revealed that autism rates in U.S. children had increased by 30 percent in the last two years.(6)The CDC report that coincided with Trump's tweets did not actually state what caused the spike in autism rates. Given Dr. Thompson's recent testimony, however, it's easy to think of at least one possibility. By S. Johnson  ",1

440,"The monster they created is running amok. Credit: VDare. These two things happened the day after Donald Trump won the election: First, a Washington Post reporter named Peter Holley called the American Renaissance office to ask–in dead seriousness–whether anyone from the Trump team had called us for policy advice. Second, Gloria Gonzalez-Garcia, a Mexican-American explained to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram what a Trump victory meant: “We were getting the message, ‘If you are not white, you don’t belong here.’ ” So what’s the connection? Let’s start with the Post ’s Mr. Holley . [ ] He is a professional newsman who attended Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism. He calls himself an “experienced reporter with a talent for uncovering compelling stories that other people overlook.” It’s his job to find out and report what is going on–and he seriously thought the victorious Trump team would check in with me for instructions. He’s not alone. The same day, a journalist from the biggest newspaper in Latin America– Folha de S. Paulo – wanted to know if I had telephoned my friend Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory. I told her I have never met him and don’t have his number. What we have here is a stupefying delusion: that Donald Trump is a secret “white supremacist,” who dances to the tune of the Alt-Right. This delusion has two sources: ignorance and maliciousness . People like Peter Holley are so deeply marinated in liberal ignorance that they can’t tell the difference between American nationalism and racial nationalism–between the desire to put American interests first and white racial consciousness. As I have explained elsewhere , the maliciousness involved looking for racial dissidents who supported Donald Trump and then arguing that since “racists” backed him, Trump must be a “racist,” too. When Mr. Trump didn’t denounce David Duke and “white supremacy” fiercely enough to suit them, they claimed this was proof he is a secret sympathizer. They were wrong. He just doesn’t like being pushed around by journalists who hates him. The pro-Hillary media therefore created a Frankenstein monster–an imaginary Donald Trump who secretly wants to make America white again. They called him a bigot, a xenophobe, a fascist, a threat to democracy and, of course, the new Hitler. They hoped this would frighten enough voters into the Hillary camp to stop Mr. Trump, but it didn’t work. And now they are stuck with a Frankenstein president elect who, they are convinced, comes running to me for policy tips. Yesterday, Senator Harry Reid issued an idiotic press release that included these lines: White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear–especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. It is because she has heard so many Frankenstein stories that poor Gloria in Fort Worth–a US citizen–thinks the real Trump message is that non-whites don’t belong in America. And she’s hardly alone. Jason Perez (right) a university student in Hawaii, writes that “the next four years will be a living nightmare for all Hispanic Americans.” Mercedes Rosales , a high school senior in Homestead, Florida, says Mr. Trump “just wants to get rid of Mexicans, or Latinos.” Maria Perez , also of Homestead, says, “Because of the example of Donald Trump . . . now they can look at you and see you are an immigrant and kill you.” Mary Rabago , a Hispanic journalist living in Arizona, explains the election results: “Hate won.” The Muslim reaction is just as nutty. Asaad Alabdulaziz, an Iraqi who recently became a US citizen , asks, “Do I have to go back?” Sahar Aziz , a professor at the Texas A&M University, says that “the general mood I am seeing among Muslims is concern that a Trump presidency will be open season on them.” No one–not once in the campaign–ever talked about deporting law-abiding legal residents. So where did people get these deranged ideas? Obviously, from media caricatures. Hispanics are no doubt getting lurid stuff from the Spanish-language press as well. Telesur , a consortium based in Venezuela, reports that under a Trump presidency, “the rights of black and brown people, immigrants and women will suffer serious setbacks.” People like Peter Holley–who created the caricature and believe in it–are on such hair-trigger alert for “racism” that they can’t conceive of a non-racial American nationalism that expresses itself in the ideas that helped Donald Trump win: Illegal immigrants should stay out. Illegals who are here should go home. There should be no sanctuary cities. Birth-right citizenship is crazy. Muslims are potentially troublesome. Legal immigration should be cut. There is nothing inherently racial about any of these ideas, and they appeal to millions of Americans who don’t think in racial terms. But current dogma demands that we thrill to the idea that every brown-skinned newcomer–whether he has a job or even speaks English–is a precious addition to our “greatest strength,” which is diversity. Anyone who supports policies that have the effect of slowing the march of diversity is a “racist,” and might as well be a dedicated AmRen reader or even a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That’s why Peter Holley thinks Donald Trump wants my advice. The notion that Mr. Trump will hurt blacks is especially wrong, but it follows the usual sloppy liberal thinking: If you want to send home illegals it can only be because you hate Hispanics, which means you hate blacks, women, homosexuals, and Jews. Donald Trump wanted Confederate flags taken down in the South, is “fine” with affirmative action , and he blasted Justice Antonin Scalia’s critique of race preferences in universities. And only the most fevered imagination could have prompted the Salon headline: “ I Am a Gay Jew in Trump’s America. And I Am Afraid for My Life .” Mr. Trump’s close professional and family connections to Jews are well known . It is the widely circulated fantasies about Donald-Trump-the-racist that explain why Mexican-Americans and Muslims who are US citizens are reportedly crying themselves to sleep at night, and why there are violent anti-Trump demonstrations all over the country. Just as reckless anti-police reporting paved the way for the murders of policemen , frothing press coverage of Donald Trump has sent thousands of ignoramuses into the streets to smash store windows and attack cops. The papers are now full of breathless reports of Trump supporters calling blacks “ni**er” and tearing hijabs off Muslim women. Some of these attacks were faked , but some are no doubt real. What do they reflect? What Donald Trump wants or what the Frankenstein wants? If loutish whites are telling Hispanics “we’ll deport you,” who gave them the idea that a modern-day Hitler is about to move into the White House? The Trump-is-a-racist idea is so firmly planted in the minds of Hillary supporters that nothing can dislodge it. But they don’t even understand what they, themselves, mean by it. Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones called me after the election to talk about the Alt-Right. I explained to him how the media have painted a dishonest picture of Donald Trump, and he conceded that he was beginning to realize that using his favorite word–“racist”–to describe the president elect and people like me might be a mistake. I congratulated him on this intellectual breakthrough, and then asked what Donald Trump has ever said or done that was “racist,” whatever that word means. “Oh, there are so many, I don’t know where to begin.” “Then just tell me one.” There was a brief silence. “He retweeted an image of himself as Pepe the frog.” “What? Is that the best you can do? You’re really straining.” “Yes, I guess I’m straining.” Mr. Harkinson later brought up Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Judge Gonazlo Curiel’s Mexican ancestry meant he could not try the Trump University case fairly. I pointed out that Judge Curiel is a member of La Raza [the race] Lawyers, which gave Mr. Trump grounds to doubt his impartiality. “Besides,” I said, “if a white police officer is in an altercation with a black criminal and ends up shooting him, you’d be the first to say the officer was biased on account of his race.” “Not the first.” “Then the second.” We live in a world of malicious fantasy. If members of that priestly class known as journalists–everyone knows they are sternly objective–call someone a “racist” that’s what he is. And once you’re a “racist,” you might as well be a sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semite, homophobe, and who knows what else. This is what we get when reporters slant the news and then believe what they read in the papers. And the media can’t understand why no one trusts them anymore.

442,"Donald J. Trump’s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media, the banks and the government.   Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word: globalism. It is a word that conjures many images, none of them good: shuttered factories, unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that, believers say, controls the economy and the media. Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the  . They say it carries multiple meanings  —   from benign to sinister  —   and often serves as a “dog whistle” for racist,   and antigovernment conspiracy theorists. “Globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States,” said Ryan Lenz, the editor of Hatewatch, a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “It is the enemy, ultimately. ” Globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization, the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions, environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But for the far right, the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism, xenophobia and   according to Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League. Lauren Southern, a host on the   Canadian media site Rebel Media, explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September. She said the word meant rule by autocrats  —   such as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and the United Nations  —   who value “the false flag of diversity” and “unchecked immigration from the third world. ” “Globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition, disdain national culture, laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third world,” she added. “They want open borders, cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions, and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it. ” Breitbart News, the   website run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s newly appointed chief White House strategist, frequently attacked globalism and   “globalist elites” during Mr. Bannon’s tenure there. But no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than Alex Jones, a   radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his Infowars media empire. He has been called “the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among his claims: the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Conn. was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job. Mr. Jones posted his own definition of globalism to YouTube in 2014. In his trademark shout, he described it as a “global digital panopticon control system” engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites. He called it “the total form of slavery. ” The host, who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump, hailed the Republican as a “George  ” historical figure. Mr. Trump, who appeared on his show last year, has in turn heaped praise upon Mr. Jones. “Your reputation is amazing,” Mr. Trump said. “I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we’ll be speaking a lot. ” So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism? His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, provided a definition in an email before the election last week:   groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War, when it replaced communism as an idea that was an   danger to the nation, Mr. Pitcavage said. They have also referred to it as the New World Order, and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere. The shape of that conspiracy had distinctly   overtones, in part because many of communism’s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism, Mr. Pitcavage said. Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the businessman and philanthropist George Soros. Those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former President George Bush celebrated the end of the Cold War in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a “new world order. ” His use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot. “It was very easy for them, especially because he was the one who said it, to take that ball and run with it,” Mr. Pitcavage said. “From that point on, the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory. ” The term’s multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool, and Mr. Trump’s and his allies’ frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience. “  is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right” from the mainstream to the extreme, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Professor Levin called globalism “the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right” but said it had also “become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in. ” Globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of Mr. Trump’s campaign, for example, when he told  a rally in Florida in October that his opponent for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, had sat at the heart of a   conspiracy with international bankers “to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty. ” The   League criticized the speech for “evoking classic   themes. ” Conspiratorial talk has continued after the election. Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday, when he complained on Twitter that   protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters. Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News, later accused Mr. Soros of “inciting riots. ” Many on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump’s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy. Last Friday, Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon. Ms. Hicks, the Trump campaign’s spokeswoman, did not reply to an email seeking comment late Sunday night. Mr. Jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important: the coming destruction of “the globalists that hijacked the country,” primarily the news media and international business people. Soon they would be destroyed once and for all, he suggested. “This is America battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains,” he said. “There’s not gonna be any détente. We know you’re scum, and we’re just here to let you know you’re scum. ”",0
443,"ATLANTA  —   With local television programming interrupted and a camera trained on the defendant’s emotionless face, an   father was convicted of murder on Monday for causing the death of his young son by deliberately leaving him in a hot car more than two years ago. A jury in southeast Georgia, where the case was tried because of intense pretrial publicity here, returned guilty verdicts against the man, Justin Ross Harris, 35, on eight counts, including malice murder and cruelty to children. Mr. Harris, who sometimes glanced downward as the verdict was read in Brunswick, could be sentenced to life in prison for the death of his    son, Cooper. The verdict, announced on the jury’s fourth day of deliberations, ended the suspense of a trial that began on Oct. 3, and it capped nearly 29 months of sordid allegations and scrambled loyalties. The cause of Cooper’s death was undisputed  —   Mr. Harris left him in a Hyundai Tucson while he worked as a software engineer at Home Depot on June 18, 2014  —   but it fell to jurors to decide whether he had been malicious or merely  . The manner of Cooper’s death is a heartbreakingly familiar one: At least 39 children in the United States have died of “vehicular heatstroke” this year, according to statistics compiled by a San Jose State University researcher. But the case against Mr. Harris was striking because of the severity of the charges and the state’s argument that he was eager to end his responsibilities to his family. “This killer’s heart abandoned this child long before he died,” Charles P. Boring, an assistant district attorney, said during his closing argument. “This defendant’s heart abandoned this child when he left him to die a terrible death in that car. ” In a statement after the verdict, the district attorney’s office noted a message that Mr. Harris sent minutes before he left his vehicle, Cooper still in his car seat: “I love my son and all, but we both need escapes. ” But near the end of a trial in which Mr. Harris was vilified as a   man with a compromised marriage, one of his lawyers, H. Maddox Kilgore, argued that moral failings did not make a motive for murder. “There is no evidence of any kind of hatred or bad feelings or anger,” Mr. Kilgore said. “Whatever term you want to come up with, any term you come up with, there’s no evidence that Ross expressed that toward his son. ” In the end, Mr. Harris was convicted on all eight counts for which he was indicted. Three of the charges were not connected to Cooper’s death and instead focused on Mr. Harris’s electronic communications with at least one underage girl. He will be sentenced next month. Although Mr. Harris’s former wife, Leanna Taylor, filed for divorce after Cooper’s death, she testified in her husband’s defense. Ms. Taylor’s lawyer, Lawrence J. Zimmerman, said she was “deeply disappointed” by the verdict.",0
444,"Richard N. Bolles, a former Harvard physics major, Episcopal minister and career counselor whose own twisting vocational path led to his writing “What Color Is Your Parachute?”  —   the most popular  ’s manual of the 1970s and beyond  —   died on Friday in San Ramon, Calif. He was 90. His son Gary said he died in San Ramon Regional Medical Center. Mr. Bolles lived nearby in Danville, Calif. Mr. Bolles (pronounced bowls) originally   his manual in 1970 as a photocopied   booklet for unemployed Protestant ministers. In 1972, he recast it to appeal to a wider audience and found an independent publisher in Berkeley, Calif. willing to print small batches so that it could be frequently updated. Since then, “Parachute” has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print. In 1995, the Library of Congress placed Mr. Bolles’s book squarely within the canon of classic American   literature by including it, along with Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and the “The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,” in “25 Books That Have Shaped Readers’ Lives,” a list compiled as part of a nationwide   program. The book’s unconventional yet pragmatic advice, whimsical narrative style and vintage graphics  —   reminiscent of “The Whole Earth Catalog,” another   survivors’ manual of the time  —   earned it respectful reviews for its reliable research and an early    following among career counselors and personnel directors. It also found a fan base among   attracted to Mr. Bolles’s homespun style  —   a fusion of boot camp rigor (  should spend at least 40 hours a week hunting) practical advice (“If you’re being interviewed over lunch, never  —   never  —   order a drink . .. Don’t . .. do . .. it! . .. Even if they do it”) and muted spirituality.   was an art form, more like dating than like selling a used car, he told readers. “You may never understand why things sometimes work, and sometimes don’t,” he wrote. With that in mind, Mr. Bolles said, “What Color Is Your Parachute? ,” subtitled “A Practical Manual for   and Career Changers,” was framed less as a guide to the job market than as a guide to help readers understand themselves  —   to help them figure out what they really liked doing so that they could find the job that would let them do it. “You need firm ground to stand on,” Mr. Bolles told an interviewer in 2000. “From there you can deal with the change. ” Mr. Bolles, an ordained Episcopal minister until 2004, when he left the ministry, said the title of his book came from an   discussion he had in the 1960s with parishioners who were unhappy in their jobs. They would say they were thinking of bailing out. “And I always thought of an airplane when I heard that phrase,” he said. “So I would respond, ‘What color is your parachute?’ ” “Parachute” climbed   rankings slowly but steadily throughout the decade. In 1979, it reached the New York Times   list, where it remained for more than a decade, returning intermittently for years afterward. Mr. Bolles was well qualified to write a handbook on changing direction he had changed his own several times, from planning a career in the chemical industry to becoming a minister and then, at 41, experiencing being fired and enduring the anxiety of unemployment at a time when he and his wife then, the former Janet Price, had four small children. It had never entered his mind, though, that he would write a blockbuster. “I was just trying to help people be better prepared than I was when I was fired and started looking for a job,” he said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. Yet whether he knew it or not, Mr. Bolles had anticipated a sea change in the relationship between workers and employers in the United States, said Micki McGee, an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University and the author of “  Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life,” a 2005 examination of   literature that includes an analysis of Mr. Bolles’s book. She said “Parachute” had come along at the beginning of a historic shift, when corporate strategies like outsourcing, subcontracting, downsizing and mergers were starting to erode traditional notions of job security. The idea that you could stay in one job for a lifetime began coming undone in the early 1970s, and “Parachute’s” perennial sales reflected, at least in part, this new reality. Mr. Bolles said he had come to acknowledge that connection over time, but, he added wryly, the success of “Parachute” had also reflected the fact that it was a pretty good book. Richard Nelson Bolles was born on March 19, 1927, in Milwaukee, the first of three children of Donald Clinton Bolles, an editor for The Associated Press, and the former Frances Fifield, a homemaker. His brother, Donald Jr. who followed his father into journalism, was killed in 1976 in Phoenix when a bomb detonated under his car. Don Bolles was then working as an investigative reporter for The Arizona Republic, and the killing was widely believed to be linked to a series of exposés he had been writing about corporate and organized crime in the state. The assassination resulted in the prosecution of one person but remained largely unsolved. After serving in the Navy at the tail end of World War II, Richard Bolles studied chemical engineering for two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then transferred to Harvard, where he earned his bachelor’s degree cum laude with a major in physics. While still an undergraduate, he was moved by a sermon he heard one Sunday at church about a critical shortage of ministers. After graduation, instead of accepting a lucrative job offer in the chemical industry, he decided to become an Episcopal minister. He attended General Theological Seminary in New York, where he received a master’s degree in New Testament studies and was ordained in 1953. He served as a rector at several churches in northern New Jersey, including St. John’s in Passaic, where he often counseled teenagers on sex and drug use. After participating in the 1963 March on Washington led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. he reached out to an   church in Passaic and, with its pastor, the Rev. Avery Johnson, led the integration of their churches, despite the opposition of some parishioners. Mr. Bolles had been a clergyman for 18 years when a combination of budget problems and philosophical differences with superiors led to the elimination of his job and his dismissal in 1968 as a pastor at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, the flagship church of the Episcopal Diocese of California. After six months of anxious searching, he landed a job in 1969 with United Ministries in Higher Education, an interdenominational church organization that had long been involved in recruiting and supporting college chaplains across the country. But college chaplains were increasingly being laid off, leaving Mr. Bolles a new mission: to help chaplains at campuses in seven Western states find new careers. That effort led him into research that inspired him to write the   manual that evolved into “What Color Is Your Parachute?” Among his other books was “The Three Boxes of Life and How to Get Out of Them,” on balancing work and personal life. Besides his son Gary, he is survived by his wife, Marci Mendoza Bolles two other children from his first marriage, Stephen and Sharon Bolles and 10 grandchildren. A third son, Mark, died in 2012. In the 2014 interview, Mr. Bolles said he hoped his franchise would continue after he was gone. His son Gary, he said, had asked him about updating future editions of “Parachute” and finding other   experts who might provide new advice. “I told him to make sure to find people who were funny, have a lightheartedness about them,” Mr. Bolles said. “When you are out of work and on the ropes, that is so important. ”",0
445,"Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon delivered a powerhouse presentation along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus at CPAC on Thursday, in which one of Bannon’s main messages was that the media’s daily war against the Trump administration will continue unabated. [As Bannon explained to the CPAC audience:  [President Trump] is going to continue to press his agenda as economic conditions get better, as jobs get better, [and] they are going to continue to fight. If you think they are going to give you your country back without a fight, you are mistaken. Every day, it is going to be a fight. Bannon also clearly and bluntly stated the reason that the media onslaught will continue, saying, “The corporatist, globalist media is adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has. ” Bannon’s message is solidly based in fact, and a deeper understanding of what he means by the “corporatist, globalist media” goes a long way toward explaining why the establishment media will be battling Trump tooth and nail. For one thing, the “corporatist, globalist media” is really a very small number of companies  —   something that Steve Bannon understands well given his background in both media and on Wall Street. As Business Insider reported five years ago, six corporations control 90% of the media in America, which puts a huge amount of power in the hands of a very few people. That number is down from 50 companies back in 1983. Who runs things? A ranking of the world’s largest media companies of 2015 says that Comcast Corporation is the largest media conglomerate in the U. S. with The Walt Disney Company,   Century Fox, and Time Warner in the second, third, and fourth slots. The members of the media, the “opposition party at the back of the room,” are really just cogs in this machine  —   the   foot soldiers who’ve been put through a rigorous program of indoctrination in journalism school. These members of the progressive left not only face corporate pressure to conform to certain narratives, but members of the modern American media have also been taught that they possess a moral superiority and are on a mission to help make the world a better place. This combination of corporate overlords and leftist propaganda is what allows the media to avoid the inherent contradictions in the system that they defend. It’s why the media can spread the message of “open societies” and a world based on “love, not hate” that is being directed by billionaire funders like George Soros and his multimillionaire allies like the Clintons. Now add in the internationalist factor at an ownership level, even with fundamentalist Muslim countries like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As Forbes reported, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and the company Kingdom Holding have stakes in media ventures like Twitter and even the parent of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. The Saudi Prince owns about 1% of the company, plus 6. 6% shareholding in 21st Century Fox Inc. worth about $1. 7 billion. Kingdom Holdings also has substantial shareholding in Time Warner, the parent of CNN. This is just one small example of the complex world of globalist media that the Trump administration is facing and part of the reason that more and more people are turning to new media upstarts like Breitbart News to get real information. As former executive chairman of Breitbart, it’s a world that Steve Bannon sees clearly.",0

447,"  Carol Adl in News , UK // 0 Comments A Tory councillor believes that homeless people in Bradford city centre should be ‘grabbed by scruff of the neck’ and ‘dealt with’. The comments by David Heseltine, a Conservative Party Councillor in Bradford caused outrage during a meeting of the Council’s regeneration overview and scrutiny committee. He said : “The tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said they’d go into Bradford if they were eliminated.” He claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. So what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless “by the scruff of the neck” and eliminating them? EvolvePolitics reports: Why Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towards providing people with homes, opportunities for employment, improving mental health services and providing interventions for alcohol and drug addiction. The ‘Nasty Party’ Councillor said that he had spoken to people who claimed that they would not visit Bradford city centre due to the number of drinkers and beggars. Heseltine is correct in his assertion that Bradford council – like many other councils – places the town centre aesthetic above the needs of those that live in and around them. However, his suggestions for dealing with the problem of homelessness are utterly reprehensible. These are people, not dogs or vermin to be disposed of to make your town look just a little better. Most people are never more than three paychecks away from being homeless. Our elected representatives would be well advised to remember that.",1
448,"In late July, The American Conservative ran an interview with J. D. Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine’s website. The interviewer’s last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance’s publishing debut, “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. ” Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10. After reading “Hillbilly Elegy,” you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we’re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he’s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. Imagine that. On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant. But his profile is misleading. His people  —   hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view)  —   didn’t step off the Mayflower and become part of America’s ascendant class. “Poverty is the family tradition,” he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers  —   all     occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security. Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a   steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw  —   in newscaster English, that’s grandma and grandpa  —   who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a   life (house, car) they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life. Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, “a violent nondrunk,” was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance’s mother was an empress of instability  —   violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn’t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she’d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands. The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin,   as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don’t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds. “Hillbilly Elegy,” in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells  —   most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life  —   and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes? In Mr. Vance’s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he’s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community’s problems the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he’s also convinced that it “increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. ” His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line. He could not afford a cellphone. “Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,” Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. “I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about. ” Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the “Obama economy. ” Or with a former   at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant. Squint, and you’ll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance’s argument. It’s always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can  —   just as President Obama can say to fellow   “brothers should pull up their pants,” as he did on MTV. The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view. Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his   confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn’t laziness that’s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls “learned helplessness”  —   the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot. What he’s really writing about is despair. Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He’s plumped with hope his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. “There was something almost spiritual,” he writes, “about the cynicism of the community at large. ” His friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel “rigged” and inaccessible job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck? Mr. Vance doesn’t have all the answers. But he’s advancing the conversation.",0

All Governments Lie, The Movie By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 A Film About Liars and the Journalists That Expose Them By David Swanson Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media’s choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” That’s the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone . The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there’s a good deal of overlap — enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. I’d have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I’m tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky’s analysis of how the media system is “rigged” without those doing the rigging believing they’ve done anything at all. It’s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It’s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it’s an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone’s tradition. One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I’d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. Stone’s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn’t believe it. Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone’s work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We’ve learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.

451,"Trump and Brexit Defeat Globalism, for Now Anyway   14, 2016 Trumpism as a stress test for democracy …. A series of populist anti-globalism shocks is a test for Western democracies. Trump’s stunning ascent to the White House is the clearest signal yet of an anti-establishment revolt unfolding in major democracies, stretching across the Atlantic. – Swiss Info Tech Was Trump’s victory actually created by the very globalist elites that Trump is supposed to have overcome? There are some who believe the elites are actually splintered into numerous groups and that domestic US elites have positioned themselves against the banking elites in London’s City. We see no fundamental evidence of this. The world’s real elites in our view may have substantive histories in the hundreds and thousands of years. US elites are basically in the employ of a handful of families, individuals and institutions in our view. It is confusing because it is hard to tell if Hillary, for instance, is operating on her own accord or at the behest of higher and more powerful authorities. It is probably a combination of both but at root those who control central banks are managing the world’s move towards globalism. History easily shows us who these groups are – and they are not located in America. This is a cynical perspective to be sure, and certainly doesn’t remove the impact of Trump’s victory or his courage in waging his election campaign despite what must surely be death threats to himself and his family.. But if true, this perspective corresponds to predictions that we’ve been making for nearly a decade now, suggesting that sooner or later elites – especially those in London’s City – would have to “take a step back.” More: The vote to propel Trump to the US presidency reflects a profound backlash against open markets and borders, and the simmering anger of millions of blue-collar white and working-class people who blame their economic woes on globalisation and multiculturalism. “There are a few parallels to Switzerland – that the losers of globalisation find somebody who is listening to them,” said Swiss professor and lawyer Wolf Linder, a former director of the University of Bern’s political science institute. “Trump is doing his business with the losers of globalisation in the US, like the Swiss People’s Party is doing in Switzerland,” he said. “It is a phenomenon which touches all European nations.” Again, this article presumes that Trump has “won” and that he intends to attack the larger globalist enterprise and the bankers funding it. On the other hand, it could be that both Trump and Brexit have been engineered to look as if the tide is turning against globalism when it is not. Why would those in charge want to portray this point of view when it may not be so? Because of what we call the “Internet Reformation” that has blasted open the secretive manipulations of the globalist elite in the past decade or so. It is almost impossible for globalists to promote internationalist memes in this environment. Yet it is the secretive injection of internationalist memes into the body politic that moves society toward the globalist enterprise. As we have suggested before, it is perfectly possible that a decision has been made to pretend to grant the larger society a “victory” over internationalism. Following this analysis, certain trends would be identified and encouraged that would seem to portray globalism as falling back on its metaphorical heels. In truth, if this analysis is correct, globalism’s retreat is a kind of pretense that will steer society less obviously in a globalist direction. One way this could happen is by ensuring the splintering of Europe – but not in a way that actually reduces control from Brussels. It will APPEAR to be so but won’t actually happen. The same thing could take place in the USA under Trump. Again, this is not to say that Trump is party to this plot or even approves of it. But the idea that Trump is part of a co-option is certainly a feasible alternative to an alternative analysis that takes what is happening at face value. Nonetheless, even if an alternative elite strategy has been decided on to realize globalism in another fashion, it ought to be pointed out that things have changed. And the Internet and its revelations are surely responsible. This is a very big deal and it is one that ought to be emphasized repeatedly. Brexit and Trump could be, somehow, the result of a different elite approach – but the approach HAS changed nonetheless. Think of it this way: Hillary represented the blunt approach toward the realization of further globalism. Her way included an aggressively expanded war and the pursuit of other globalist trends. Trump, rhetorically anyway, has a different approach in mind that would gut many internationalist trends. If Trump follows through on his rhetoric, the trend toward an internationalist world will be reduced. And while there is controversy over Trump’s recent staff appointments we should also bear in mind that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both seem to be failing now. If indeed Trump’s election has damped the progress of TPP, and TTIP, this is a huge event. As we’ve pointed out, both agreements effectively substituted technocratic corporatism for the current sociopolitical model of “democracy.” The elites were trying to move toward a new model of world control with these two agreements. This is similar to what happened after the advent of the Gutenberg Press when the elites of the day moved away from royal control and apparently swapped in democracy. It seems evident that internationalism is now going to take a longer time to realize than we thought. However, this observation may not be entirely accurate if Trump turns out to be something other than his rhetoric suggests – or if Brexit is denied in Europe. Additionally, one of the elite’s most powerful, operative memes today is “populism vs. globalism” that seeks to contrast the potentially freedom-oriented events of Trump and Brexit to the discarded wisdom of globalism. See here and here. The reality of these two events, the victories of both Trump and Brexit, stand as signal proof that elite stratagems have been defeated, at least temporarily. Though whether these defeats have been self-inflicted as part of a change in tactics remains to be seen. Conclusion: But the change has come. One way or another the Internet and tens of millions or people talking, writing and acting has forced new trends. This can be hardly be emphasized enough. Globalism has been at least temporarily redirected",1
452,"WASHINGTON  —   It must have been uncomfortable for Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the United States Olympic Committee, to sit between two gymnasts during the congressional hearing about sexual abuse on Tuesday. To his right, Jamie Dantzscher started crying during her testimony. She described how she was molested by the former U. S. A. Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar when she was a teenager. Dantzscher, 34 and a former Olympian, said Nassar abused her “all over the world. ” “In my own room, in my own bed, in my hotel room in Sydney at the Olympic Games,” she said, through tears. “I thought I was the only one. ” To Adams’s left, Jessica Howard, a former national champion in rhythmic gymnastics, testified that Nassar began assaulting her when she was 15, during what he called therapy for a hip injury. “He began to massage my legs, and then quickly moved inwards on my thighs,” she said. “He then massaged his way into me. ” Give these women credit for telling their stories. They’re a main reason Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, decided to introduce a bill that would make it mandatory for national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police. It would be a federal crime not to report abuse. Give Adams credit, too. In the past, the Olympic committee had failed to prioritize the issue of sexual assault and appeared to turn a blind eye to the issue by handing it off to the governing bodies of each Olympic sport. But on Tuesday, finally, Adams said something that was a long time coming. He said sorry. “The Olympic community failed the people it was supposed to protect,” said Adams, the head of organizational development for the national governing sports bodies, which exist under the umbrella of the United States Olympic Committee. “We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse. ” Nassar was fired by U. S. A. Gymnastics in 2015 and is currently in jail in Michigan, where he is facing multiple sexual assault charges and federal child pornography charges. He has denied any wrongdoing. You would think U. S. A. Gymnastics would also go out of its way to apologize for its role in a scandal that has shaken Olympic sports and caused the ouster of its president, Steve Penny. More than 80 athletes have accused Nassar of abusing them. But the gymnastics organization did not even have a representative in that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room. Feinstein had asked U. S. A. Gymnastics to testify, and said its board chairman, Paul Parilla, was thinking about it but backed out. Instead, Parilla provided a statement. It said that the board of directors offered “our sincere and heartfelt regrets and sympathies” to any athlete harmed and that U. S. A. Gymnastics was “appalled that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in the manner alleged. ” No apologies. Court documents released this month showed U. S. A. Gymnastics had complaint files on 54 coaches regarding sex abuse claims from 1996 to 2006. No apologies, even for its lack of a backbone and for sending only a lobbyist to the hearing. That lobbyist first identified himself as working for U. S. A. Gymnastics  —   which I figured, considering he was holding a file folder that said, “USAG 50 copies” on it. A few minutes later, he said, no, he was actually there for U. S. A. Hockey. The federation has had no shame, either. When the sex abuse bill was introduced, Penny and others from U. S. A. Gymnastics met with Feinstein about the federation’s sexual assault policies. How about this for a   stunt: Tagging along was Mary Lou Retton, the smiling, bubbly sweetheart from the 1984 Games, as they said that the federation’s policies were solid and that gymnastics was a happy, safe place. On Tuesday, Feinstein and her fellow senators weren’t thrilled that the gymnastics federation had ditched them this time. “If they really cared, they would be here,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said as he looked at Dantzscher and Howard, the abused gymnasts who testified. “They have to answer for what happened to you. ” At a news conference later, Blumenthal called for an investigation into “who knew what and when. ” Feinstein said she would like to see the gymnastics board of directors change and for its replacement to be people who make the sexual assault issue a priority. The U. S. O. C. should hasten that change. It can do so by decertifying U. S. A. Gymnastics, which would basically kick the federation out as the national governing body for the sport of gymnastics in the United States. To let U. S. A. Gymnastics back into the family, the Olympic committee could demand that the federation clean house and start new with fresh faces. The committee has used this power with other federations, and it used its influence to push out Penny when the Nassar case exploded into one of the biggest abuse scandals in sports history. It might as well go a step further, if only to show athletes and other federations that it won’t tolerate sexual abuse on its watch. When asked if U. S. A. Gymnastics knew about the abuse of gymnasts at the hands of Nassar, Feinstein said: “Do I believe they knew about it? Absolutely, yes, I do. ” But they didn’t report it, she said, and that’s the culture of the sport. If Feinstein’s bill passes, it would help change that culture. The new U. S. Center for SafeSport  —   a nonprofit formed to prevent and handle abuse in Olympic sports  —   should help, too, if it ever gets going the way it should. Last week, after many delays, including a struggle by the Olympic committee to find funding, the center finally opened for business. There should be a hotline for athletes and others to anonymously report abuse in Olympic sports. Good luck finding it on the center’s website. Feinstein said the Olympic committee should easily find money to fund the site and keep it running, whether it’s through raising money from the private sector or using its own cash. “The Olympic committee has money, so they can use it the way they want to use it,” she said. Mattie Larson was sitting in the public seats at the hearing on Tuesday. She is 24 now, but I first met Larson, a senior at U. C. L. A. when she was 15, sometime before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was quiet, and a rising star. She said she was being molested by Nassar around that time. So many years later, in 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published an article about a gymnast who accused Nassar of abusing her, Larson’s former teammate on the national team called her and said, “Read the story and tell me what you think. ” The two said they realized that Nassar had abused them. It had never occurred to them that his   “intravaginal treatment” was sexual assault. After all, he was the head doctor for U. S. A. Gymnastics. If the federation trusted him, they should, too. Now Larson replays the abuse in her head, again and again. What could she have done to stop it? What should U. S. A. Gymnastics have done to stop it? “I’m mad at myself for not knowing,” she said of the abuse. “On so many levels, it was complete betrayal. “You’d think in a sport with young girls, with young girls wearing leotards, prancing around with their legs flying all over the place, that U. S. A. Gymnastics would educate gymnasts and coaches and parents about sexual abuse. But they didn’t. And they knew they should have. ” Larson said it could have saved her and others, countless others, if the U. S. Center for SafeSport had existed when she was competing. “There are so many more victims who haven’t come forward yet,” she said. “I know them. They’re national team members, Olympians. ” At the very least, U. S. A. Gymnastics or the United States Olympic Committee could have mandated sexual abuse awareness training for athletes and their parents. The committee didn’t require its national governing bodies to run abuse education programs, or even conduct criminal background checks, until 2014. When Adams was asked why so many years had passed with no independent entity like the SafeSport center, his answer was vague. “It took too long to happen,” he said.",0
453,"Airbnb has capitulated to the demands of lawmakers over its operations in New York City, the company’s largest market in the United States, agreeing to drop a lawsuit in which it was pushing back against a newly passed state law that it said could have hurt its business. The   home rental service on Friday settled the lawsuit that it filed against New York City two months ago. The suit challenged a New York law that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in October. That law called for fines of as much as $7, 500 for illegally listing a property on a rental platform such as Airbnb. The company had said the large fines could have deterred hosts and impaired its revenue in New York City. Hosts in the city generated about $1 billion in revenue last year, and the company took a cut of that in fees. But Airbnb on Friday agreed that it would drop the suit as long as New York City enforces the new law only against hosts and does not fine Airbnb. The settlement takes effect on Monday. The agreement is a victory for opponents of Airbnb. The company and New York authorities have battled for years over the legality of offering   lodging through the service, and the relationship has long been inconsistent. Since 2010, it has been illegal in New York to rent out a whole apartment on Airbnb for fewer than 30 days. In October, Airbnb said it was willing to crack down on people in New York City who rent out multiple homes, bowing to pressure from politicians and tenants’ rights groups who said the company had made it harder to find affordable housing in the city. “This is an astounding   on the part of Airbnb, which clearly recognized that this was a foolhardy and frivolous lawsuit,” Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who wrote the law that Airbnb opposed, said of the settlement on Friday. In a statement, Airbnb said the settlement was “a material step forward for our hosts. ” Airbnb has been fighting with local governments around the globe that are displeased with the effects of the online rental service. Cities such as Amsterdam, Miami Beach and New Orleans have been closely watching the New York case. “I expect the city will now get down to the important business of enforcing the law against the serial lawbreakers on the site” who turn affordable housing into illegal hotels, Ms. Rosenthal said in her statement. “This is a win for everyone. ”",0

455,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia  —   Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with   populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers. Yet 140 miles of   roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest. Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America. “Vancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,” Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. “We should make the most of those cultural commonalities. ” Whether their grand vision of a “Cascadia innovation corridor”  —   which borrows its name from the region’s Cascade mountain range  —   ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada’s smoother immigration process. For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies. One serious obstacle to Vancouver’s tech ambitions is its   housing costs. The median price for a detached home in the metropolitan area in August was 1. 4 million Canadian dollars (about $1. 06 million) a 27. 8 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, the median single family home price was about $848, 000, according to Zillow. But while median pay for   jobs is $112, 000 a year in the San Francisco Bay Area, it is just under $49, 000 in Vancouver, according to an analysis by PayScale, a compensation data firm. (Some of that discrepancy is due to a drop in the value of Canada’s currency relative to the United States dollar.) “We have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,” said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region’s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand). Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city. Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country’s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere. Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate’s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States. “Right now, there’s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,” Mr. Smith said. Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea. At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates,   of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education. One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a   rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project  —   which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more  —   have not been worked out. A group of Seattle techies proposed a cheaper alternative: a dedicated lane for autonomous vehicles on Interstate 5, the highway connecting Seattle to the Canadian border. The plan  —   which relies on autonomous vehicles that still need a lot of work  —   would not shave much time off the commute between the cities, but could make the ride less tedious by letting travelers work or watch a movie, said Tom Alberg, a managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture capital firm, and an author of the proposal. With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver’s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech “unicorn”  —   a   valued at over $1 billion  —   in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools. But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1. 78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech   in the last decade, compared with about $8. 9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates. Still, the city’s   tech boom may hit a wall if it cannot address its    issues, which are by some standards more acute than those plaguing other thriving cities. Vancouver was ranked the third most unaffordable city in the world, after Hong Kong and Sydney, in a study published this year by Demographia, a consulting firm. Mr. Yan has spent years analyzing his hometown’s soaring real estate values and concluded that a surge in foreign capital, primarily from mainland China, has decoupled Vancouver home prices from the local economy. British Columbia recently imposed a 15 percent tax on new home purchases in the Vancouver area by foreign buyers, a move now facing legal challenges. The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when   get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver. “Companies tend to run into scaling issues,” he said. “You end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons. ”",0
456,"Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now they’ve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as   of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M. I. T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year, they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts. But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses   data  —   and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  —   especially   men without college degrees. “The conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and it’s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover,” Mr. Acemoglu said. “If you’ve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you don’t have the skills to go into health care,” he said. “The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change. ” The paper’s evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who said at an Axios event last week that artificial intelligence’s displacement of human jobs was “not even on our radar screen,” and “50 to 100 more years” away. (Not all robots use artificial intelligence, but a panel of experts  —   polled by the M. I. T. Initiative on the Digital Economy in reaction to Mr. Mnuchin’s comments  —   expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement.) The paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists: why, if machines are replacing human workers, productivity hasn’t been increasing. In manufacturing, productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  —   and now we see evidence of it in the employment data, too. The study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670, 000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple. The paper adds to the evidence that automation, more than other factors like trade and offshoring that President Trump campaigned on, has been the bigger   threat to   jobs. The researchers said the findings  —   “large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages”  —   remained strong even after controlling for imports, offshoring, software that displaces jobs, worker demographics and the type of industry. Robots affected both men’s and women’s jobs, the researchers found, but the effect on male employment was up to twice as big. The data doesn’t explain why, but Mr. Acemoglu had a guess: Women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a   field. The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6. 2 workers and wages by 0. 7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places. Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0. 25 percent. The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans. David Autor, a collaborator of Mr. Acemoglu’s at M. I. T. has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans, and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy. “I don’t think that this paper is the last word on its subject, but it’s an exceedingly carefully constructed and   first word,” he said. Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. “I still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today,” he said. “But the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots. ” In addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  —   mostly in the Midwest, South and East  —   and Western Europe added 1. 6. The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies. The next question is whether the coming wave of technologies  —   like machine learning, drones and driverless cars  —   will have similar effects, but on many more people.",0
457,"Email An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)—and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. With Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates—including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton’s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City—and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon’s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company’s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line—and that caused JP Morgan’s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the “massive bribery scheme” that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup—and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present—bringing Hillary Clinton’s total “cash grab” from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million—all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton’s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS. To what Jamie Dimon said to Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this “megabanks” master plan to save itself had “serious deficiencies” that could “pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States”. Two months after the FDIC’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically “sounded a warning” that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “someone is going to get hurt”. Unbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse—and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that “this market is scary”, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a “Red Alert” warning all of its clients warning them to “prepare for a severe market crash”. With one of the first casualties of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is “nearing its doom” and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe—who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers. As Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the “Clinton Crime Story of the Century”, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.",1
458,"We had made it to Tete, Mozambique. The sun was sinking behind the Zambezi River like a scoop of orange sherbet as we sat on the motel’s deck taking in the quiet close of another long day on the road. But we avoided one another’s eyes. The table in front of us was cluttered with maps, notebooks, competing spreadsheets and empty beer bottles. “I don’t know, man,” Robert said. “Mozambique’s interesting, but it kind of reminds me of Spain in the ’80s. Maybe we should go our separate ways. ” For days, tensions had been building. It was hard traveling with another family, facing the endless   of a road trip, especially this one. Robert and his wife, two Dutch friends whose children are about the same age as ours, were hankering to go west to see Botswana’s Kalahari Desert and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. I had promised our two boys, Apollo, 6, and Asa, 4, that we would hit the beach in Mozambique, fabled for its pristine coastline. But this wasn’t just a quibble over the route, which, in the spirit of this trip, we had always intended to be flexible. We were getting on one another’s nerves. No. That’s too soft. We were annoying the bejesus out of one another. We were locking horns over everything  —   when to stop and fill up the jerrycans, which little guesthouse to sleep in, whether to get chicken and chips or omelets, again, for dinner, great chunks of silence sitting between us at meals. And now as we contemplated the nuclear option, breaking up, we were staring down the most treacherous road of the entire trip: Mozambique’s Tete corridor, where a conflict that had claimed thousands of lives was reawakening. Some people had just been ambushed, the motel manager told us. “By who?” I asked. He just shrugged. “Bandits? Rebels? Rogue police officers?” It was all the same to him. “And from Inchope to Save,” he said offhandedly, mentioning two towns on our map. “Meu Deus,” he said, closing his eyes. “That’s even worse. ” The next morning my wife, Courtenay, and our sons jumped into our truck. “Roll ’em up, lock ’em up,” I said as we swung out of the parking lot. We headed down a long, bright highway by ourselves. I’d told Robert that we would meet him in Cape Town, though who knew if either of us would actually make it. Cape Town was still nearly 2, 000 miles away. This odyssey  —   driving across the bottom half of Africa, without any firm plans  —   started out as a lark. We were at a birthday party at Robert’s house at the time, (which was late last year) we all lived in Nairobi, Kenya. During the festivities, Robert abruptly turned down the music and called everyone outside. He has worked all over the world for the United Nations and other international organizations and speaks about 38 languages. You know what military officers call “command presence”? Well, Robert has it in spades: tall, handsome, confident, topped by a wicked crest of pure white hair. He also has an awesome smile. The instant he told everyone to go outside, I knew what he was up to. He was going to give his wife a car, and I could tell from the glint in his eye that this was as much a selfie gift as anything. Stepping into the driveway, everyone gasped and started laughing: He had bought her an old green Land Rover Defender, the ultimate safari vehicle, and wrapped it in Christmas lights adorned with Chinese lanterns. Maybe we had all had a little too much to drink, but in the glow of the moment I swung my arm around Robert’s back and mumbled, with Champagne breath: “With a car like that, you can’t just drive to the mall. Hey, man. Why don’t we drive to Cape Town?” Of course, we could have flown to Cape Town. But we were all hopelessly smitten by the historical, romantic and mystical experience of traveling Africa overland: covering all of that beautiful countryside, savoring the long distances, losing time, not just passing through landscapes but being absorbed by them. I think each of us was also a bit worn down by the rigors of our jobs and of being mommies and daddies to young children. We believed, perhaps naïvely, that turning our Christmas vacation into a challenge could rejuvenate us. It was the most ambitious road trip any of us had ever planned: 4, 250 miles one way, 16 days, six countries, five young children, four hardheaded adults and two questionable trucks. “Sounds like a bad Christmas carol,” Courtenay muttered. To be honest, she was never into it. Most areas we intended to pass through in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa were relatively safe for drivers, northern Mozambique being the one question mark. But it wasn’t as though we had AAA for back up. You break down in rural Malawi or back roads Tanzania, where there aren’t any spare parts or much transport, and you might as well get comfortable for a week. And our truck was no spring chicken. It was a Nissan Patrol, sturdy as heck but 11 years old and with more than 100, 000 miles and a few rattles. This all might sound risky, maybe even reckless, but I’ve lived in East Africa for more than a decade and felt comfortable traveling here, knowing the region was more accessible than most people appreciate. As the   date approached, our mountain of gear stupidly grew. (When you take a road trip, you’re the worst packer. You think: “Oh, yeah. We’ll have all the room in the world.) Soon we were running out of space in our operational staging area. Our guest room was heaped with mosquito nets, tarps, sleeping bags, bed rolls, tin dishes, flats of water, a monstrous medical kit containing everything from malaria prophylaxis to Tums, copies of our passports, visas and this thing called a “Carnet de Passages,” a very   customs document that allows you to cross borders in your own vehicle. We’d also packed too many clothes, a satellite transmitter, spark plugs, granola, nuts, fuses, boxed milk, an air pump, a tow rope and seven packages of Huggies, for the long rides. Little did we know that within a few days, in Malawi, we would enter the dominion of Shoprite, a South African chain, where we could have bought many of these supplies if we had actually needed them. As we pulled out of our driveway, car stuffed, I looked up to see dark clouds and bright sunshine, the dramatic, schizophrenic lighting that often illuminates Nairobi’s equatorial skies. We passed zebras in Kajiado, an area that used to be rural but in the frenzied urbanization of Nairobi in the last 10 years is now more like a suburb. By midday, we reached the Tanzanian border. We spent the next hour and a half waiting in lines, to get our passports stamped, to get our yellow fever cards checked, to show our Carnet de Passages. Then we were free, out on the road again chugging past trucks with inspirational messages emblazoned on their backsides such as “Love Your Enemies. ” We crossed into Tanzania that same day, and the landscape immediately opened up: lush, green savanna unrolling from the sides of the highway. We passed through a string of villages, each specializing in a particular commodity. In the first, everyone along the road sold chickens. In the next, eggs. The village after that, oranges. We motored through spiky sisal fields that ran for miles and miles and ended in a town where dozens of people were selling wooden   stools  —   they were actually carving them along the road, flakes of wood shavings littering the highway’s shoulders  —   being gently stirred by the wind of our passing wheels. In rural Africa the economy isn’t hidden, as it is in the United States. You drive right through it. Robert was right behind me as I took a curve, perhaps a little fast. Ahead, I saw a man in a white uniform step out from under a mango tree into the road. Shoot. A police officer. He had his arm up, which meant stop. In eastern Africa, most traffic officers don’t have guns, radios or cars. You could blow past them and probably never get in trouble. It’s essentially an honor system: You stop because it’s the right thing to do. The officer sauntered up to my window with a black plastic object that I could have sworn was an old hair dryer. It was actually a radar gun, one that looked like it belonged in “Smokey and the Bandit. ” I had been speeding, he said. I don’t think the radar gun even had batteries, but I knew the game. In East Africa, it’s called “kitu kidogo,” “a little something” in Swahili  —   a euphemism for a bribe. You have to always let them make the first move. “Do you know the fine?” the officer asked. Earnestly, I told him I did not. “Twenty thousand shillings,” he said. “But,” he smiled, “if you don’t need a receipt, I make it 10. ” Who was I to argue? Soon we were whizzing past baboons shrieking from trees. Our boys kept a running tally of all the animals we saw: monkeys, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, gazelles, antelope, warthogs, even elephants. Tanzania is rightly celebrated for its wildlife. If we’d had the time  —   which we didn’t  —   we could have gone from national park to national park and made our drive one endless safari. We did camp one night next to Mikumi National Park, home to all the big wildlife species. The   Lodge was perfect: a clean spot for tents, showers and a nearby restaurant, $7 for each adult, free for children. A few bites into dinner, I could tell that the food  —   burgers, chips and roast chicken  —   was fresh and had been made with care. As we bedded down, I heard lions grunting in the distance. Or maybe it was just Robert snoring in the tent next to me. “Man, never in my life did I think I’d be here,” Robert said, smiling in the doorway of a border town barbershop where we went looking to change money. “Malawi was always distant in my memory, like this little country lost in the middle of Africa. ” One of the most pleasant African countries, Malawi is also one that Western tourists rarely visit. It is small, green, landlocked and friendly. Never aggressively colonized like Kenya or South Africa, its raison d’être is the lake. Lake Malawi is home to a thousand kinds of fish, more than any other lake in the world. It’s a beautiful place to swim and snorkel, with little industry or pollution. Scientists say you can catch bilharzia, an infection caused by a parasitic worm, but the risks are minimal along isolated beaches, where most tourists tend to go. As soon as we crested a hill and for the first time spotted Lake Malawi sunning itself, Courtenay said: “Can I sit in a beach chair just once on this trip? Is that asking too much?” Robert and company supplied the answer: Butterfly Space, a small   on Nkhata Bay. It sounded amazing, from the guidebooks: “spacious beachfront,” “picturesque beauty,” an “oasis. ” We booked it from the road, calling just a few hours ahead. We did that a lot, conducting a little internet research the night before or flicking through a guidebook, which gave us flexibility, because we didn’t know how far we would get each day. We rolled in at night, always a   in the dark it’s hard to tell what you’re getting. A guard steered us to a campsite that smelled of dog poop. As I was helping Robert set up his tent, I noticed garbage strewed everywhere. But I didn’t want to sound negative about a place he had picked, so I kept my mouth shut. “Hey, mon. ” It was a voice from the bushes. “Uh, yeah?” I answered, looking around. A young man stepped out, dreadlocked and  . “Name’s Happy. ” “Happy what?” Robert growled. Robert and I hadn’t eaten for hours, and the two of us were dangerously crabby. We just wanted to get the tents up and find some food. “Happy Coconut, mon,” the young man answered. “Happy Coconut. I’m soooo happy. ” Robert shook his head and whispered, “I think the guy writing the guidebook was high when he passed through here. ” Butterfly Space slithered with tattooed travelers smelling of patchouli oil and Malawi Gold (the cheap and potent local ganja). We weren’t prudes, but it didn’t seem to be the ideal family spot. The next morning we hit the road. We tended to drive about 10 hours a day, starting around 8 a. m. and by dusk we would find a small hotel or guesthouse, usually for no more than $50, sometimes for as little as $10. Road trips are as much about what is happening inside the car as out. Our collective brood, all boys between ages 4 and 7, did surprisingly well, napping, looking out the windows and pulling each other’s hair only occasionally. The roads were tarmac all through Malawi and Tanzania. The only problem was gas. Malawi has few fuel stations, and I ran out twice, rescued by Robert. I think our best day of the entire trip was shortly before we split up. We had treated ourselves to a classy old whitewashed hotel, the Sunbird Livingstonia Beach Hotel, on Salima Bay. It wasn’t even that expensive, around 90, 000 Kwacha a night, or about $125, and we took the day off from driving to swim in the   lake and get tossed around by the waves. I didn’t want to leave. But Robert and his team hadn’t signed up for a beach holiday, and driving all the way to Cape Town had been my great idea, after all. When we told the room steward that we had to go, he shook his head wistfully. “It’d be great to see other countries, see how other people live,” he said, folding a sheet. “In Malawi, everyone’s born in Malawi. They live in Malawi. They die in Malawi. They don’t see anything else. ” The instant we crossed the border, it felt as though we were in a different place. This is a huge benefit of arriving in a new country by land. You immediately get a sense of its development, its atmosphere, its spirit, which is hard to do in an antiseptic international airport. One of the few former Portuguese colonies in Africa (most of the continent was grabbed up by France or England) Mozambique has a palpable Latin vibe. The storefront colors were zanier, the clothes tighter, the music louder. As we cruised through a tiny village blasting salsa, Courtenay turned to me and asked, “Is this country deaf?” We were without comrades now. We had emerged unscathed from the scorched wastes of Tete and were flying downhill toward the legendary Praia do Bilene beach, on Mozambique’s southern coast. When we pulled in, I couldn’t even hear Courtenay’s yelling which way to go because of the roar of motorcycle engines. Young South Africans raced around on Ninja bikes, shirtless or in bikinis. We discovered that Mozambique during Christmas is a bit of a South African colony. After getting the keys to a rundown rondoval at a seaside hotel, we scampered to the beach, to sand that sparkled  —   but not in the way you might imagine. It was the day after New Year’s. Thousands of beer bottles lay at the water’s edge, as though they had been vomited up by the sea. The place was a pigsty, but our boys loved it, collecting dozens of dirty bottles and making giant bottle castles. In Kenya, you’d never see that. Poor people would have been all over that beach, scooping up the empties to make money from recycling. Courtenay and I found the whole scene depressing and consoled ourselves with heaping plates of rice, pãozinho (Portuguese rolls) and shrimp so succulent and tasty that even the boys  —   who usually flee at the sight of anything unusual on their plates, especially if that unusual thing has eyes  —   gobbled it up. But our clock was ticking. Robert was somewhere out there, chugging his way south. Though we’d had our disagreements, I missed seeing that dark green Land Rover behind me. As we hustled toward the Swaziland border, a wall of brown, stubbly mountains rising before us, I guess I started to zone out. I didn’t see her until it was too late. A corpulent police officer stepped out from under a tree. That was always their strategy: Hang out in the shade and wait for a victim. It was the equivalent of the American patrol officer on a motorcycle hiding behind a billboard. She walked into the road, arm up. When I pulled over, she fanned her face. “Que calor, que calor,” she said. (How hot.) “Indeed,” I responded. She asked for my license. I gave it to her. She asked for my insurance. I gave her that as well (a special Mozambican policy covering who knows what that I had spent $60 on at the border). She frowned. The boys stirred in the back seat, as she made a leisurely loop around the truck. She returned to my window. “You pay fine,” she said. “For what?” I asked. Her eyes darted around. “Baby no have seatbelt. ” “What? He just took it off. We’ve been stopped for three minutes. ” “Baby no seatbelt. We go police station Matola. ” “Matola?” I said incredulously. “Isn’t that an hour away?” “Then pay fine here,” she said, staring into my face. “Three hundred meticals. ” After I handed it over, she waved happily goodbye. The Kingdom of Swaziland is a strange little place: population 1. 4 million per capita income $8, 500, not bad by   standards and one of the world’s lowest life expectancies, at 52 years. AIDS destroyed this place, possibly because it is a country in between. In Africa, transit points have become H. I. V. hot zones   truckers are some of the worst culprits for spreading the virus. Swaziland’s roads were good, its landscape barren and windswept. We drove end to end in 2 hours 48 minutes 7 seconds. By the time we reached South Africa, we had six days of vacation left and more than 1, 000 miles to go. I had visited South Africa nearly a dozen times, but I had never driven the country. The landscape was dreamy: rippling green hills, tall trees and miles and miles of farms and vineyards stocked with grapes so plump and juicy, you just wanted to pull over and pluck them. I found myself asking: “How did this happen? How did South Africa get all the good land?” We caught one of the most beautiful sunsets I’d ever seen. Over the west side of the N2 highway, fingers of light reached into a cool, dark forest. We made three stops on the way to Cape Town, our favorite being St. Lucia, a   town sporting carpets of crab grass for front lawns. It felt like Boca Raton, Fla. except for the   hippos lumbering through the neat little streets at night. Set in a large estuary filled with life, St. Lucia is a great place for a boat tour to see hippos and crocodiles, which we enjoyed, booking through Hornbill House, the    where we stayed. We were all eager to get to Cape Town, arguably one of the world’s most stunning cities. Our boys were excited to see the penguins at the Simon’s Town penguin colony. I was ready to stop driving. Courtenay just wanted the trip to end. As we curved around a mountain near the penguins, bubbling with the sense of triumph at having made it, a familiar green Land Rover hurtled toward us. I tooted madly. We pulled over and hugged, a lot, in a parking lot. It was great to see Robert, his wife and their children, and we were sorry that we hadn’t been able to stay together the whole time. But we had adventures to share and the children were talking fast: “We saw crocodiles!” “Well, we saw a castle!” I wished I had seen more. Driving across Africa was far more doable than I expected: The roads were safe, the border crossings not too hellish, and it was no sweat booking hotels by cellphone on the fly. But we should have taken two months, not two weeks. Then we could have explored more wildlife parks, slipped off the main roads and lingered in small, charming towns, as opposed to getting up at the crack of dawn and strapping in again. Robert, God bless him, arranged for two couples to fly to Cape Town and drive our vehicles back to Nairobi, because they wanted to have the same road trip experience. On that final Sunday, we loaded into our trucks one last time and drove to the airport, his truck right behind mine. Then eight hours later, we were all back home.",0

460,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  —   It was Nov. 12, and Bill Maher was about to begin his comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when he did something he hadn’t done in many years. He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie (tequila). “And boy did I miss it,” he joked with me last week. “What an idiot all those years  —   drinking’s fun. You hear that, kids? Drinking’s fun!” Actually, that’s not why he did it, he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking  —   and, in his case, a wee bit of pot smoking  —   that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge (oh, the indignities of this job). He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional. But that night, so soon after the election, he needed something to calm his nerves. Donald J. Trump, who Mr. Maher said “lives for vengeance,” had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government, like the Justice Department, and, more to the point, the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that “no one’s been meaner to him than me. ” Mr. Maher has a unique perspective. He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion, dodging traffic from left and right. He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth. But first, a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a   totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his   ABC show, “Politically Incorrect. ” He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldn’t be called “cowards,” especially when the United States’ preferred method of attack at the time  —   before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  —   was to lob cruise missiles from afar (“That’s cowardly,” he said). The White House criticized him, sponsors fled and, a few months later, ABC canceled his show. Whatever you might think of his argument, the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse. It could have been a   too, if HBO hadn’t provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show, “Real Time,” which has an audience of about 4. 5 million viewers. Yet, Mr. Maher puts that episode within “the normal parameters of awful. ” He says he’s more worried about our new era, when no one knows what “normal” is going to look like. It’s amazing how much anxiety Mr. Trump’s imminent inauguration is stirring in the   business  —   but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press, his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him. No one knows whether a year from now, we’ll see today’s fears as overblown, underblown, or on point. Mr. Maher is taking the    approach based on his own experience in the Trumpian combat caldron in 2013. That was when Mr. Maher launched a “birther” —   or, “ ”  —   campaign about Mr. Trump, to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President Obama’s citizenship. Appearing on “The Tonight Show,’’ he joked that Mr. Trump was the product of   crossbreeding it was the only thing, he said, that would explain the “color of his hair. ” He said he would donate $5 million to a charity of Mr. Trump’s choice if he could prove this wasn’t the case. (Mr. Maher pledged $1 million in 2012 to a “super PAC” supporting Obama.) Mr. Trump’s lawyers replied with a copy of his   birth certificate and a demand for the money, which Mr. Maher ignored. Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere. “It was worth it in comedy material,” Mr. Maher told me, taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head (a gift from a friend) as we stood by the bar in his   living room. “But you definitely spent money. ” That is, Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford. He takes it as a harbinger. “No one knows what this man is capable of,” Mr. Maher said. “I never, ever, ever felt worried  —   it never crossed my mind  —   that George Bush would do something crazy, even though I knew he hated me. He never sued me for a joke. ” Mr. Maher was particularly focused on reports that several F. B. I. agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton, which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump. (The Justice Department’s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. ’s   performance.) “It is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized,” he said. “When the internal police department is politicized, that’s a place I don’t want to be on the wrong side of  —   I mean, that’s fascism. ” You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia, and it’s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism. But with so many sharing similar worries (at least among those who didn’t support Mr. Trump) and with Mr. Trump’s continued cage rattling, I turned to Mr. Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for a response. It seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of Mr. Maher’s, dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the   trail on Comedy Central. Given Mr. Trump’s preference for Twitter, Ms. Conway joked, using the F. B. I. would be “so last century  —   it’s so bureaucratic and paperwork laden. ” Turning more serious, she said, “He’s not going to use the ‘tools of state,’” repeating the wording of my question. I noted that there are, of course, guidelines, professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a president’s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon, and she agreed, saying “This is America. ” Ms. Conway acknowledged, though, that Mr. Maher’s fears were widely held, especially in Hollywood  —   witness Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes address. “Talk about a Hollywood story  —   folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable,” she said. She described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by “the elites” to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks. “Where’s the respect  —   open ear and open mind? ’’ she said. “The same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets,” she said. It was time, she said, to “take the poison out of the pen and keyboard. ” Mr. Maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day, Jan. 20 (his birthday, and Ms. Conway’s). But he shares Ms. Conway’s view of the cultural stakes in the election. “We’re the losers now, so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more,” he said. Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. Streep’s  —   calling actors, screenwriters and the news media to arms  —   weren’t going to solve anything. “It looks very insular,” he said. “Just the liberals talking to themselves, which they are very good at doing. ” Still the bane of conservatives, Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism, for which he says liberals have too much tolerance. That’s part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left. At the same time, his restaurant selection, the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel, came in defiance of a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. To join the boycott, Mr. Maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby, would be to submit to an ineffectual form of “tokenism. ” “As if the sultan of Brunei is up there looking at the receipts  —   we only sold two soups? Is Stallone still coming in?” he said. “But Sultan, your harem awaits  —   ‘I’m sorry, I’m still going over the receipts. ’” With that, we took our seats and the waiter approached. Surprised to see Mr. Maher, he asked “You’re not in hiding?” That got Mr. Maher all worked up again. “I can be scared,” he said, “and never pull a punch. ”",0
461,"Lydia Ko could win her second consecutive ANA Inspiration title this week, or be eclipsed by Michelle Wie winning her first in her 13th career start, and it would still be   for the women in one respect. As the top golfers on the L. P. G. A. Tour compete in their first major tournament of the year, they will be   to ignore the storm clouds gathering in advance of their third, the United States Women’s Open, to be held in July at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Before Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he was the Daddy Warbucks of women’s golf, hosting the top players every year at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. during the L. P. G. A.’s   ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. In 2006, the tournament’s   prize was $1 million, a milestone that the men had reached seven years earlier. In his prepolitics life as a real estate mogul, Trump dispensed business advice to the L. P. G. A. players and invited them to his courses for informal rounds of golf. The women generally accepted his invitations for the same reason they play   events every year with dozens of other golfers, including those who harbor different political and personal beliefs: These people, usually men, sustain the Tour with their support. “Having played in the ADT Championship when it was held at his course in West Palm Beach, I have experienced nothing but good things from him and his golf course,” said Karen Stupples, a reporter for the Golf Channel and NBC who competed in the event in 2004 and 2008. “And I think the L. P. G. A. in general feels that same way, that he was very respectful to the L. P. G. A. to the tournament. ” The picture that L. P. G. A. golfers paint of Trump as a respectful supporter of women stands in stark contrast to the leering,   man caught conversing with Billy Bush during a taping of a 2005 segment for “Access Hollywood” in a video that surfaced shortly before the election. Since Trump became the putative leader of the free world, he has often been seen on the golf course, and for some of those outings, he has reached out to some of the best players in the game to accompany him. The top men and women have accepted invitations to play with him with their eyes wide open. They know that what they see as a social outing will be spun as a political statement  —   and they seem largely not to care. In an anonymous survey I conducted in February of 56 players on the PGA Tour, 50 (or 89 percent) said they would play with Trump if extended an invitation. Three said they would not, and three declined to answer. How would the best women, whose ranks cut across more cultures than the men’s, respond? At the Founders Cup in   the first L. P. G. A. event of the year held in the United States, I conducted an anonymous survey of 40 players.   (or 60 percent) said they would play with Trump, nine said they would not and seven declined to comment. A   joked, “I want to stay in the country so I’ll say yes. ” The women, who ranged in age from under 20 to over 50, represented 12 countries and make their homes in 11 states, including four that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election. One player, Natalie Gulbis, spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Another, the Floridian Lexi Thompson, has played golf with Trump since the election. Ko, the women’s No. 1 from New Zealand, has not played a round with Trump  —   but only because she hasn’t received an invitation. “He’s the leader of one of the biggest countries in the whole entire world,” Ko said, “and it would be an honor if I got that call. ” Ryann O’Toole, an American who was raised in California, said, “I didn’t vote for him and I’ll still play with him. ” Ko is 19. Thompson is 22. O’Toole is 30. Stupples is 43 and the mother of a    son. It is unfair, Stupples said, to expect a consensus on any political issue from a tour membership that includes women under 20 and over 40 and Americans and foreigners. “Lydia and Lexi have both led a very sheltered life,” Stupples said. “They’ve played golf and that’s it. They probably haven’t seen much of what goes on outside of the golf course and a hotel. ” She added: “Would I play golf with him? Probably not. But then that’s me. That’s because I’ve been around the block a few times and seen a few other things. But it’s only because of my life experience that I feel like I can make a good judgment on what I want to do personally. ” The United States Golf Association awarded its flagship women’s event to Trump’s Bedminster course in 2012, when his reputation as an opportunistic outsider came from supporting golf when the economy was cratering and other benefactors were bailing. “He was such a huge fan of the L. P. G. A. and of golf in general,” said Gulbis, who has known Trump since she qualified for her first ADT Championship in 2005. Throughout the years, she said, he has counseled her to fight for the same pay as PGA Tour members for public appearances or sponsorships. “These were constant conversations that I saw him have not just with me, but with lots of people in our organization,” Gulbis said. The United States Women’s Open will not be the first golf major played at a Trump course. The Women’s British Open in 2015 was held at Turnberry, a Scottish resort that Trump bought in 2014, after the tournament had been awarded. In the past few years, some other top golf events have been given to   courses. This year’s Senior P. G. A. Championship will be at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, and the 2022 P. G. A. Championship will be hosted by his Bedminster club. Shaunna Thomas, the   of UltraViolet, a national group assembled to fight sexism and expand women’s rights, said her organization failed to see the upside of any professional women’s sports league aligning itself with Trump. “I’ve been playing golf all my life, I’m very familiar with how deeply ingrained sexism is in the game,” Thomas said in a telephone interview. “It’s upsetting. People who aren’t fans think it’s such an easy decision for the U. S. G. A. and the L. P. G. A. to make to avoid controversy. ” She added: “The question really is, do the U. S. G. A. and L. P. G. A. want to be on the right side of history? If the U. S. G. A. wants to stay relevant to a younger generation of golfers, they’re going to have to take a look at their decision. This is an opportunity to send a clear signal to women, people of color and people with disabilities that they stand on the side of inclusiveness. ” UltraViolet staged a protest on the third day of the Founders Cup, calling for the Women’s Open to be moved from Bedminster or, barring that, for the players to boycott the event. Roughly a dozen people gathered outside the public entrance to Wildfire Golf Club, the tournament site on a Marriott property in Phoenix, and handed out items including “Dump Trump” golf balls before being escorted away by hotel security. The organization also commissioned a plane to fly over the tournament grounds with a banner that read: “LPGA: Take a Mulligan. Dump Sexist Trump. ” On the eve of the protest, the L. P. G. A. one of the world’s oldest women’s professional sports organizations, released a statement that described its mission as creating opportunities “for the best female golfers in the world to showcase their talent” and said, “As a global tour and membership, we try not to let politics get in the way” of such opportunities. The organization added that the U. S. G. A. owns and operates the United States Women’s Open and “we respect and support the decisions made by the U. S. G. A. on this matter. ” The statement did not sit well with Thomas, who grew up in Los Angeles and played golf with her father at Rolling Hills Country Club and Riviera Country Club. Many of the courses she frequented were about as integrated as Trump’s cabinet, which has a smaller percentage of women and minorities than the first cabinets of his four immediate predecessors. “The ladies that play golf shouldn’t be forced to build up the Trump brand in any way,” she said. Judy Rankin, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, is discomfited by the notion that the players should allow politics to play through in the most prestigious women’s tournament in the United States. “Back in the dark ages, I did not agree with everything Gerald Ford did,” said Rankin, whose most successful season, 1976, coincided with Ford’s last full year as president. She won six tournaments that year and became the first L. P. G. A. player to surpass $100, 000 in yearly earnings. “I found him to be the most wonderful man, and I certainly played golf with him,” Rankin added. “Because you play golf with them does not necessarily mean you support every single thing they do. But they hold the highest office in the land. And I’m not sure that an invitation to play golf should be answered with a political statement. ”",0
462,"56 Views November 14, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News As the bond market continues to melt down, interest rates rise and the Dollar Index surges above 100, legend Art Cashin gave one of his most important interviews ever to King World News about a Trump presidency, the New World Order, gold, Brexit, the Great Depression, and why we will see panic before the end of the year. Eric King: “In Trump’s acceptance speech he said that we are going to have massive infrastructure spending. Is that bearish for gold? I don’t think so.” Gold Market Hit As Druckenmiller Sells Art Cashin: “No. That on the face of it would not be a reason to sell gold. One of the things that may have concerned Druckenmiller was not so much your scenario of fiscal spending and building roads and highways, but the fact that despite what the Fed has been doing, the money supply has not been showing any velocity. That’s a topic you and I have discussed time and time again and it’s one of the holdups to gold because if it gets no velocity that’s deflationary. In fact, the largest growth in money stock is in cash — green pictures of dead presidents — and that is deflationary because that does not have a lending factor that money in a bank would have. So those are two deflationary trends in money and that tends to weigh a little bit on gold and doesn’t allow it to fulfill its promise that you would expect in a somewhat inflationary period.” Eric King: “Victor Sperandeo, a former associate of George Sorors, said to me this will be ‘pure money printing.’ That we are going to print trillions of dollars and build infrastructure — talk about how you view that. Obviously there are going to be jobs created and it will be great for infrastructure, so it will juice the economy, but what are the longer-term ramifications?” Art Cashin: “On the face of it, it looks good. As you said, there will be jobs created and there will be improvements in roads and airports and so on. However, the other shoe to fall is that Mr. Trump is also committed to revamping the tax code. And those two things should lead to a massive increase in the deficit. And we are already deeply in debt, so people like Rosenberg and others feel like it will have virtually no impact. On the face of it the stimulus program should be great for the economy, but because you are in such a high level of debt it might not work out that way. He and others point out that if fiscal stimulus were the answer then Japan would be the king of the world with all of those bridges to nowhere that they built. Japan spent a lot of money, built up their deficit, and their economy never really turned around.” Eric King: “Going back even further than that and looking at the Great Depression, the United States was struggling and then FDR devalued the dollar by revaluing the price of gold higher. Those public works projects then got underway, the massive public works projects that built so much of the infrastructure here in the United States, Art. And that did turn the stock market around. It turned many things around — commodities, etc — but then it rolled over by 1937-1938 and then the war came. Is this infrastructure spending program something that can look good for a little while and then it will just roll over like we saw in 1937-1938?” Art Cashin: “It can. And the problem (during the Great Depression) was that the thing didn’t click, as it were. It didn’t lead to the next step. You hire people, you do the road projects, you do whatever, and then you want to see them go out and spend and business begin to borrow and banks to lend. And in ’37 and ’38 that never fully kicked in. U.S. Experiences Second Stock Market Collapse From 1937 To 1938 You had high government officials, in frustration, go to Congress and testify: “We couldn’t get it started. We just couldn’t get it started.” For all of the deficit spending, for all of the government programs, it never fully worked. That’s the fear. Again, if you go back to Japan, clearly they spent trillions of Japanese yen in massive building projects and it never kicked in, it never took over. The people continued to worry and hold onto their money. A Worried Public Is Hoarding Cash As I’ve told you before, this whole thing about helicopter money and whatnot, if Bernanke flew over your house and dropped a million dollars in brand new money, and you were so worried that you got up and hid it in the garage until you figured out what the economy was going to do…And that is virtually what has happened to us for the past seven years. They have tried all kinds of increases in money supply but it has never kicked in and people are so terrified that they are not spending, and basically, as I said, the large amount of growth was in cash. So they are putting it in the mattress, not even in the bank.” Eric King: “Art, for so many years on King World News you have been talking about this lending and spending not kicking in, and you have used that Bernanke analogy over and over again. It’s not normal for you to beat up on a point as much as you have. But earlier you brought up Japan, and then when we covered the Great Depression you discussed 1937-1938, and the the testimonies before Congress from people saying, ‘We just couldn’t get it started.’ Did you know all along that it was going to unfold this way to some degree with the lack of lending and spending? Did you know that from history?” Art Cashin: “I had a fear of it and it became pretty evident after some of the first things they (central planners) did. It is not a very difficult game. Every week the Federal Reserve reports the Money Supply and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis reports the Monetary Stock, which is the amount of raw money that the Fed adds in. “We Just Couldn’t Get It Started” – Monetary Stock Plunging “That Shouldn’t Be” For a year now, despite all the things you have heard, despite all the programs and ‘pump-priming’ and Yellen and all the doves, the Monetary Stock has not increased all year. That shouldn’t be. 60-Year Velocity Of Money Stock Hitting New Lows If money has velocity, then you can see the economy begin to move up. If it gets too much velocity, then you get to see inflation. But so far we are not getting a high dose of either. Although, if you ask somebody standing in the supermarket if they have inflation they might give you a bit of an argument. But by government standards it’s not quite there yet.” Eric King: “Along those same lines, Art, you’ve warned repeatedly about Weimar Germany and the experience of the 1920s. This idea that there can be no inflation and then suddenly it just kicks in and then all hell breaks loose. You’ve warned so many time about that. Is that what’s in front of us?” Art Cashin: “You will begin to know it. Everybody talks about the Weimar Republic where they actually printed cash money and flooded the system. It wasn’t just the bank reserves — they actually flooded the system with paper money. And amazingly, amazingly, it was a while before that actually kicked in in an inflationary manner. And as you alluded to, I’ve said this time and time again, it’s one of those things like spontaneous combustion — it’s there and it’s there and it’s there and suddenly it bursts into flames. And when it bursts into flames it consumes everything about it. And that’s when you can have a runaway inflation. But so far it has not burst into flames. And that is why to even some degree the Fed is frustrated, hoping to get inflation up above 2 percent. And they may be in a position where, be careful what you wish for. Because if they get 2 percent and above it could suddenly combust and things could begin to move rather rapidly.” Eric King: “Art, let me ask you this about the Trump presidency. It seems like for those people out there who, as he said, felt lost, the lost Americans, and for those out there who really felt like they were having globalism shoved down their throats in Europe and in the United States, this seemed to be a moment in time where there was going to be some backtracking. The borders were going to be closed, there would be some protectionism — we all know the plusses and minuses of that — but how did you view this Trump election and him becoming president, the idea that the elite got sand kicked in their face and that this New World Order would be slowed down, if only for a moment?” Donald Trump’s Shocker And Why Brexit Is Nowhere Near Over Art Cashin: “I view it as yet one more extension of what looks to be a populist revolt that is sweeping the world. You saw the beginning of it with Brexit, and you have too many pundits on TV saying, ‘Well, that ended quickly in reverse.’ Brexit is nowhere near over. But the reason that markets didn’t continue to spiral (downward) is that they realized that Brexit has basically been postponed. They haven’t gone in and declared Article 50. Once they start the process in motion, the consequences of Brexit are going to be there and they are going to be drastic. Now, if you take Trump’s election as the second leg of populism, the next thing you look for is the December 4th referendum in Italy. And there’s a good chance that will cause the government to fail and Italy will be right back in the middle of a major European crisis, and we’ll be right back where we were with Greece (only much larger in scale). So this game is far from over and we could see further panic as we head into the end of the year.” Eric King: “Ahead of what’s going to happen in Italy, because I think that will unfold as you just predicted, Art, a Trump America going forward and this idea that the elites have been pushing globalism down everybody’s throats with NAFTA and so many things that have happened around the world. The globalism and the push to eliminate national boundaries, we’ve seen that in Europe and of course they had talked about combining Canada, the United States and Mexico into one regional unit. This idea that globalism has taken a huge blow here, is that true? Or did it just slow it down? What will a Trump presidency mean in that sense?” “You’re Fired!” Art Cashin: “We’ve got a lot of things to see. Over the next week or two you are going to see whom he appoints to the cabinet and who holds him under their sway. It would appear, however, because of the size of his commitment, he’s got to address globalization and global trade. He’s got to go back and revisit even NAFTA. I think some of his early attempts will be reasonably good. He will do some fiscal stimulus, some building and repairing, hopefully getting the tax structure in better order. But that will not be the end of it. He can pivot a bit but he can’t completely abandon it (his campaign promises). People will have to watch what he does. Now, he may cleverly hire some people and put burdens on their shoulders. If after six months things don’t work out, he can revert to his TV personality and say, ‘You’re fired,’ to show the American people that he’s staying on top.

463,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Polk County, FL Sheriff Grady Judd stated that illegal immigrants committing felonies is a phenomenon that is at an epidemic level “across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. ”  Judd was asked about his prior comments that illegal immigrants committing felonies are an “epidemic. ” He said, “It is at that level across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. And they’re committing felonies, violent felonies, and they’re trafficking in narcotics. And if that’s not enough, we deport them, they come back, and pick up doing the same thing again. ” He added, “We’re seeing a total[ly] different attitude by Immigration and Customs already. And what we have to do is pick them up, keep them locked up until they’re deported to their home country of origin. And I can tell you this, the community will be safer, less drugs will flow on our streets, and there will be less weapons violence. Every day my detectives go out, and they seek out and arrest people for violating the drug laws. Many of those folks are illegal aliens, here, with guns, posing a specific danger to our deputies, to our law enforcement officers, and to the community. But I have a simple question for those who think there’s a problem with that: Why don’t you take them home with you? Why don’t you rent them a home next door to you? Because you know they’re living next door to somebody in our community, and they’re terrorizing them. ” Judd also stated that he didn’t think what he proposed would result in economic losses, and “The people we arrest, they’re not harvesting any vegetables, or any citrus. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

465,"Bill Herz, the last surviving crew member of Orson Welles’s mock “War of the Worlds” newscast, which terrified American radio listeners in 1938 with vivid bulletins warning Newark residents to evacuate as invading Martians incinerated central New Jersey, died on May 10 in Manhattan. He was 99. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Bill Kux, a cousin. Mr. Herz, who worked on other radio and theater productions as stage manager and casting director for Welles’s Mercury Theater company, staked one additional claim to fame. Until about six months ago, he had been a regular customer at Sardi’s restaurant, the   gathering place for celebrities and   tourists in the theater district, for some 82 years  —   beginning in 1933, just six years after it opened. That longevity alone distinguished him as a bon vivant in a shrinking cadre of original Broadway personalties. But he was also singled out periodically in the wider world as a relic of a bygone era, when a bogus radio news broadcast could provoke panic as war was brewing in Europe  —   however much that hysteria may have been overstated then and since. Welles’s CBS show “The Mercury Theater on the Air” presented an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel “The War of the Worlds” for its Halloween episode on Sunday, Oct. 30, 1938. The live hourlong program began with an updated prelude to the original novel eerily warning that superintelligent beings had been coveting “this Earth with envious eyes. ” Then music, a weather report and other regular features were interrupted by simulated news bulletins and fake feeds from   operators in the field. Mr. Herz, playing Operators Three and Five, took part in this exchange: Operator Three: This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     Warning! Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes. Reaches South Street. Gas masks useless. Urge population to move into open spaces.   …     Automobiles use Routes 7, 23, 24.   …     Avoid congested areas. Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.   …     Operator Four: 2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling 8X3R   …     Come in, please.   …     Operator Five: This is 8X3R   …     coming back at 2X2L. Operator Four: How’s reception? How’s reception? K, please. (Pause.) Where are you, 8X3R? What’s the matter? Where are you? John Houseman, Welles’s producer, wrote in his 1972 memoir, “ ”: “Our actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than 40 minutes. During that time men traveled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted it  —   emotionally if not logically. ” (Mr. Houseman went on to a distinguished career in theater and Hollywood.) Mr. Herz also read Welles’s part, that of a Professor Pierson at a New Jersey observatory, during rehearsals. He said he was surprised by the public’s response to the radio show. “During the broadcast, outside, policemen were coming,” he told CBS News in 2013. “They were told on the radio that the Martians were coming, the Martians were coming!” (Later scholarship about the incident suggested that the broadcast provoked far less fear among the public than has been popularly portrayed.) In a 2010 profile in The New York Times, Mr. Herz was quoted as saying: “I had done Orson’s part in the dress rehearsal, and after I did it, I thought to myself, ‘Nobody’s going to believe this in a million years.’ Boy, was I wrong. ” William Herz Jr. was born in Detroit on Aug. 2, 1916, the son of Harold William Herz, a girdle salesman, and the former Fannie Lichtig. (Bill Herz called himself Jr. even though he wasn’t one.) He graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh before moving to New York. He was briefly married to Susanne Guettel, whose brother Henry was a producer and film executive. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Herz had met Welles in Pittsburgh, where Welles, a young director at the time, had stopped while touring with a production of “Romeo and Juliet. ” They discovered that they had a common acquaintance in the actress Edith Meiser, a friend of Mr. Herz’s parents. Mr. Herz started working for Welles as a gofer. He later moved into Welles’s Manhattan home  —   Mr. Herz had been living with an aunt in Brooklyn  —   so that he could constantly be on call. They worked together on “Julius Caesar,” “The Cradle Will Rock” and “Too Much Johnson. ” Mr. Herz joined the Army Air Forces during World War II, managed a summer theater in Connecticut and produced and managed several plays in New York (including a few flops, one inauspiciously titled “The Strangler Fig”). After one failure, Vincent Sardi Sr. the founder of Sardi’s, generously invited him to keep an open tab in good times and bad. Another advantage to eating there was that Mackey’s Ticket Agency next door, where Mr. Herz later worked, had no restroom. Ivan Lesica, Sardi’s maître d’hôtel, said on Thursday that Mr. Herz would eat there once or twice a week and sit at Table Four, to the left of the dining room entrance, under his caricature. He would have coffee delivered in his own white mug, and typically order the chicken potpie or, appropriately enough for an habitué whom his cousin described as a confirmed curmudgeon, the crab meat sandwich.",0
466,"Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, drew a parallel on Wednesday between the Syrian government’s targeting of noncombatants in that nation’s civil war and the accidental bombing of civilians by United   forces. Attacking Hillary Clinton over what he criticized as her overly interventionist instincts, Mr. Johnson pointed to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians killed by forces loyal to President Bashar   as well as civilian deaths caused by the   coalition, and said Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, bore at least partial responsibility. But when pressed four times on whether he saw a moral equivalence between deaths caused by the United States, directly or indirectly, and mass killings of civilians by Mr. Assad and his allies, Mr. Johnson made clear that he did. “Well no, of course not  —   we’re so much better than all that,” Mr. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said sarcastically. “We’re so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital. ” The remarks by Mr. Johnson came in an interview with The New York Times after a string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs. After failing to recognize the   Syrian city of Aleppo during a television interview Sept. 8, Mr. Johnson had another difficult moment on Sept. 28, when he vainly tried to name a foreign leader whom he admired. In the Times interview on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson conspicuously sought to avoid another misstep. Asked if he knew the name of North Korea’s leader, Mr. Johnson replied, “I do. ” “You want me to name” the person, he said, then paused, before adding dryly, “Really. ” But he declined to supply the name. Mr. Johnson complained that Mrs. Clinton was being judged on her base of knowledge rather than her interventionist instincts. “Because Hillary Clinton can dot the i’s and cross the t’s on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders,” he said, “the underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside. ” He charged that Mrs. Clinton “bears responsibility for what’s happened, shared responsibility for what’s happened in Syria. I would not have put us in that situation from the  . ” More than 400, 000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, according to the United Nations. But Mr. Johnson complained that presidential candidates were expected to talk tough about dealing with dictators like Mr. Assad or risk losing support. “This is what happens in this country right now  —   unless you’re willing to say that you’re going to get tough on this stuff, on these atrocities  —   and these atrocities are horrible  —   but unless you as a politician are willing to do something about these atrocities then we’re not going to elect you,” Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson speculated about the deals or promises that the Obama administration may have dangled before   forces, but then said at other points that he was at a disadvantage discussing world events because he has not received the classified briefings that the Democratic and Republican nominees for president have been given. Mr. Johnson also declined to say whether his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, had warned him of his intention to change course and spend the remainder of the presidential campaign attacking Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, as unqualified. Mr. Weld revealed those plans in an interview with The Boston Globe on Tuesday. “That may be his primary mission,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Weld’s plans. “We’re not scripted at all. And so I guess my role will be Hillary and his role will be Donald Trump. ” But he insisted that Mr. Weld would not drop out at any point and endorse Mrs. Clinton. “Absolutely,” Mr. Johnson said when asked if Mr. Weld would fight on until Nov. 8. Mr. Johnson said that the idea of hunkering down and trying to make an aggressive play to win his home state of New Mexico, where polls show him in contention, had crossed his mind. But he conceded that his chances of winning outright were all but gone. “Right now it’s a Hail Mary, not being in the presidential debates,” he said.",0
467,"On Thursday, Republican Senators Ted Cruz ( ) and Lindsey Graham ( ) introduced legislation that would defund the United Nations over the Security Council’s passage of UN Resolution 2334, which calls Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “illegal. ”[The “Safeguard Israel Act” states that the U. S. government will be prohibited from giving any money to the UN, or any of its affiliates, until President Barack Obama confirms the UN resolution has been repealed and can certify that he has done so. America provides the UN with 22 percent of its budget, contributing $8 billion to the largely   organization annually.  “United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 falsely claims that Israel’s sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and Jewish communities in the West Bank are illegal under international law, and that the Old City of Jerusalem, along with the Temple Mount, the holiest site for the Jewish people, and the Western Wall are ‘occupied Palestinian territory,’” the Safeguard Israel Act states. The  December 23   resolution 2334 passed nearly unanimously despite the Obama administration’s decision to break with tradition and abstain from voting instead of vetoing it. Because the United States is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, an American veto would have automatically stopped the resolution and prevented it from passing. “President Obama betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by permitting the passage of a biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally,” Sen. Cruz said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Thursday morning. “The Security Council’s resolution is only the latest example of the UN’s long history of obsessive hostility towards Israel. ” Sen. Graham said, “I begged the UN months before, don’t put me in this box. I think most Americans believe the United Nations has become more   more  . ” He added, “I’m a big internationalist, but we’re gonna stop the money until we get this fixed. ” The Safeguard Israel Act also notes that during his final address to the UNSC on December 16, outgoing UN   Ban   admitted UN bias against Israel when he stated, “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports, and conferences criticizing Israel. ” The legislation adds, the “United Nations passes more resolutions condemning Israel than any other country in the world. ” Last week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on a   vote objecting to the Security Council vote. Despite strong bipartisan support for the measure, at least 75 Democrats and four Republicans voted against it many of the opposing Democrats accused Republicans of introducing HR 11 to attack Obama unfairly in the last two weeks of his presidency. Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( ) Rep. David Price ( ) and Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) were among Democrats to vote against HR 11. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz,  ",0

469,"Rose Evansky, a British hairdresser who liberated women from the prison of the   domed dryer when she invented   styling at her London salon in the early 1960s, died on Nov. 21. She was 94. Her death was reported only recently by the British news media. There was no information on where she died. Mrs. Evansky, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, set up as a hairstylist soon after World War II. She and her hairdresser husband, Albert, opened a small shop in Hendon, a London suburb, and did so well that, in 1954, they moved to Mayfair, where the city’s elite paid top money for    styling. One day in 1962, as she faced a tedious morning of chemical   and tight curling, tasks she disliked, inspiration struck. “I’d been wandering past a barbershop in Brook Street around the corner from our salon in North Audley Street, and I saw the barber drying the front of a man’s hair with a brush and a   dryer,” she told W magazine in 2012. “And this image  —   of the barber with the dryer  —   flashed through my mind and I thought, ‘Why not for women? ’” She experimented on one of her clients, a Mrs. Hay. “I picked up a spiky plastic hairbrush and a hand dryer and started rolling a wet section of her hair around the brush, followed by warm air from the hand dryer held in my left hand,” she wrote in a memoir, “In Paris We Sang” (2013). “The more sections of wet hair I rolled over the brush, the easier it became, and soon part of Mrs. Hay’s curly hair looked smooth, as if it had been brushed through from a set. Exciting!” One day by chance, Lady Clare Rendlesham, the editor of the British edition of Vogue, dropped by the salon and, witnessing a   in progress, stopped dead in her tracks. “What are you doing, Rose?” Mrs. Evansky recalled her shouting. Lady Clare immediately tipped off her friend Barbara Griggs, the fashion editor of The Evening Standard, who came in to behold the soft and flowing   style. That afternoon, the newspaper trumpeted the news of “the blow wave” to its readers. “This instantly earned her a reputation as one of the top hairdressers in London and went on to become the norm in hair drying,” Hairdressers Journal International wrote in 2012, celebrating the industry’s pioneers. Mrs. Evansky took quiet pride in getting women out from under the sizzling heat of the dome, and in the durability of her invention. “I always look at the prices of hairdressers now, and I say, my God, it’s still there: ‘’” she told an interviewer for the beauty brand Space NK in 2013. “How wonderful, 50 years later. ” She was born Rosel Lerner on May 30, 1922, in Worms, south of Frankfurt. Her parents were immigrants from Poland. In 1938, when the family was living in Ludwigshafen, her father was arrested and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Speaking only German and Yiddish, she was sent to Britain on one of the last Kindertransport trains that carried Jewish children out of Germany. She lived briefly with a family in Dudley, in the West Midlands, before moving to London, just in time for the Blitz. There, she apprenticed for a barber in Whitechapel, and distinguished herself with her zeal. “I worked and practiced till late at night on anyone who’d let me get at their hair,” she wrote in her memoir. As World War II raged, she embarked on her career, finding work at a salon near Regent Street. In 1943, she married Albert Evansky. When their marriage ended in divorce, her husband bought her share of the business. He sold it in the early 1980s. What Florence was to painting and sculpture during the Renaissance, Mayfair was to the art of hairstyling in the 1950s and ’60s. Mrs. Evansky sat atop the heap, the lone woman in a field monopolized by men. In “Vidal: The Autobiography,” Vidal Sassoon called her “without question the top female stylist in the country and the equal of any man. ” Her protégés included Leonard Lewis, known professionally as Leonard of Mayfair, who died on Nov. 30. Mrs. Evansky was in the forefront of the Mayfair style, which emphasized “freedom and movement, rather than contrived waves and curls,” Kim Smith of the University of East London wrote in her doctoral dissertation on West London hair salons. The Mayfair look led directly to the internationally celebrated styles associated with Swinging London and the likes of Jean Shrimpton, Julie Christie and Twiggy, who was a client of Mr. Lewis. In 1965, soon after leaving her husband, Mrs. Evansky married the playwright Denis Cannan, took his last name and moved with him to the countryside in East Sussex. He died in 2011. She is survived by two stepsons, Alexander and Nicholas Cannan a stepdaughter, Crescy Cannan and two  . Her own hair was naturally  . “My hair is best described as ‘windswept,’ as I live near the sea,” she told W magazine. “I’ve never colored it, and I cut it myself. Why would I let anyone else when I can do it myself?”",0

472,"Saturated Fat and Heart Disease: “The Greatest Scam in the History of Medicine” by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Dr. Malcom Kendrick is a Scottish doctor and author of the book The Great Cholesterol Con . Recently he wrote a blog post on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease. He commented on how the science actually proves the opposite conclusion from what is commonly believed about saturated fats: To be honest, I have studied saturated fat consumption many, many… many, many, times. The one thing that has always stood out, most starkly, is the complete lack of any real evidence to support the idea that it causes cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, evidence contradicting it arrives on an almost daily basis. Kendrick goes on to quote from a recently published study which showed, in Kendrick’s words: The more saturated fat you eat, the lower your risk of dying of cardiovascular disease, and vice-versa. So why is this hypothesis about saturated fat and heart disease so entrenched in medical circles? Kendrick draws an interesting parallel between the recent attacks against Dr. Waney Squier and her exposure of the theory of “Shaken Baby Syndrome” as having no scientific merit. My thoughts were drawn to this issue by something seemingly unconnected. Which is a legal hearing in the UK concerning shaken baby syndrome. Most experts in paediatrics are absolutely convinced that there is such a thing. It is quoted in textbooks as an undisputed fact. Many parents, and other adults, have been convicted, and sent to jail, for shaking their babies so hard that it caused the ‘triad’ of shaken baby syndrome: subdural hematoma, retinal bleeding, and brain swelling On the other hand, we have Dr. Waney Squier, a paediatrician who used to provide expert opinion on child abuse cases in the UK. She was struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC) for, well the exact judgement is, as per Derrida, impossible to understand. Leaving the machinations of the GMC aside, the main issue is simple. Dr. Waney Squier does not believe that shaken baby syndrome exists. Of course she knows that the triad of subdural haematoma, retinal bleeding and brain swelling exists. But she believes there could be other explanations. Including, perish the very thought, an accidental fall. Because she does not believe in shaken baby syndrome, she has presented evidence in court which has tended to undermine the prosecution case against parents and carers, accused of shaking a baby and causing severe brain damage. Much to the annoyance of the police, and they then, for it was indeed them, reported Dr. Squier to the GMC. Now, I know what most of you are thinking. Surely ‘shaken baby syndrome’ exists. This must have been proven. Well, it has not. If you think about it, how could it be proven? How do you think a study on shaken baby syndrome could ever be done? Get five hundred children, shake them forcefully and see what happens to their brains. I suspect you might find gaining ethical approval for a such a study might be tricky. Shaken Baby Syndrome: Saturated Fat Consumption Kendrick goes on to explain what he sees as the rationale in both scientific theories that seem to have very little evidence to support, and yet is widely held in medical circles. Regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome: On the fact of it shaken baby syndrome and saturated fat consumption have very little in common. However, from another perspective the parallels are clear. Both are seductively simple ideas that appeal to common sense. That most deadly of all senses. Most people can clearly see how a small, vulnerable, baby will suffer significant brain injury if it is shaken too hard. Close your eyes and you can virtually see it happening. If you can bear having that image in your head for any length of time. Most parents, I think, can almost see themselves doing it, or having done it – when their child will ‘just not dammed well stop crying.’ In short, shaken baby syndrome can easily be visualised, and it triggers a kind of visceral horror. We can easily see how a feckless parent may lack the self-control required to stop themselves doing it. ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up….’ And that, dear reader, is as scientific as shaken baby syndrome gets. A hypothesis based on visceral fear, prejudice, and knee-jerk judgement. This makes it almost perfectly resistant to any contradictory evidence. Try to argue against it, and you will meet anger and bluster and the idée fixe. Regarding Saturated Fats causing Heart Disease: The ‘saturated fat causing heart disease hypothesis’ comes from a very similar place called – well, it’s obvious isn’t it, just common sense. Heart disease is basically a build up of fat in the arteries, isn’t it? Where can that possibly come from? Fat in the diet. Especially the thick, sticky, gooey stuff that you get on a pork chop, or suchlike. That’s got to be it hasn’t it? The thick horrible squidgy gooey fat that you eat, ends up as thick horrible squidgy gooey fat in your arteries. Serves you right for eating fat, and McDonald’s, and suchlike. There rests the entire scientific argument against saturated fat. As such it is difficult to argue against. Facts simply bounce off. Comment on this article at CoconutOil.com.

474,"Lisa Tanner October 31, 2016 Four Common Mistakes When Burning Wood Do you heat your house with wood heat? Wood stoves are a great way to provide heat even when the power goes out. They help lower your heat bill . But, burning wood takes a little preparation. You need to make sure your stove is ready to burn safely throughout the winter months. You’ll have to put up a supply of firewood to see you through the season. Here are some major mistakes people make when burning wood, and how you can avoid them. 1. Not Inspecting & Cleaning Your Stove Before you start burning around the clock, make sure your stove and chimney are ready for the season. As part of this inspection, you’ll want to examine your firebrick lining and see if any of it needs replaced. The brick reflects heat, keeping the body of the stove from overheating. You’ll also want to make sure the chimney is cleaned. You can either get it cleaned professionally, or do it yourself, whichever you are most comfortable with. This will prevent chimney fires, and help your fire burn more efficiently. If any of your stovepipe leading to the chimney has a sharp turn, you’ll want to give that section extra attention during cleaning. Creosote can build up quickly in a bend. When your stove is cool, disconnect the pipe if you can and take it outside to ensure its thoroughly cleaned. While you’re checking your stove, be sure to check the seal around the door. You want a tight seal to keep smoke from getting into your house. The braid cord that’s around the door in many stove models may occasionally need replaced. Once everything is in good working order, you’ll be all set to use your stove all winter long. Neglecting these steps can lead to a chimney or house fire. 2. Not Having Enough Wood You don’t want to run out of wood in the middle of winter. It’s always best to have too much wood on hand rather than too little. How much you’ll need depends on many factors, such as: Whether your family is home all day How large your house is How much insulation your house has How low the temperatures drop in your area The type of wood you’ll be burning How hot you like your fires How much of the year you’ll burn I live in a large, old home without much insulation in the rooms we haven’t yet renovated. Most windows are still single-paned. And the kids and I are home all day long. We burn a lot more wood than my parents who live across the street. Their home is insulated well, has updated windows, and they work out of the house so they just bank their fire before they leave. Ten cord of wood is what we try to have on hand at the start of winter. We don’t typically burn it all, but if the temperatures drop below zero, we go through wood at an alarming rate. We also don’t just burn in the “winter” months. To keep the house comfortable, we usually burn September through May. It’s a lot of wood, but I’d much rather end the burning season with a head start on next winter’s supply than be caught short. We did that once when we first moved here, and falling dead trees with three feet of snow on the ground in the freezing weather wasn’t fun. When you make your estimate for firewood usage, estimate high, especially if it’s your first year. You’ll be able to get a better idea of how much wood you used in the spring. That’ll make future estimates easier. 3. Not Storing Your Wood Properly Once you have your firewood cut, it’s time to split it and stack it . You want to make sure it’s not going to get wet over the winter, so store it somewhere dry. It’s best to store your wood off the ground a bit, like on a pallet. That way the air can circulate throughout the pile and keep everything dry. You can stack your wood in a woodshed, an old barn, a lean-to, or pallets in the yard with a tarp on top. You’ll want to ensure a couple sides of your woodpile are opened to allow air to circulate. Since wood is flammable and can attract pests, it’s best not to store large quantities of it touching your house or in your basement. Properly storing your firewood will help protect your supply . That way you always have seasoned wood ready to go when you need it. If you don’t take care of your woodpile, it’ll get exposed to the elements and won’t dry out. 4. Not Having a Backup Plan What would happen if your wood supply gets stolen or compromised? What if you underestimated how much you’d need and now you’re out? If you need to heat your home and you’re out of wood, there are some alternatives to burn in your stove. Some will burn quickly, while others will smolder for quite a while. You should think through a worst-case scenario before winter hits, and examine some of your options. Rolled Jean Logs Do you have old jeans that no longer fit or are so full of holes you can’t wear them? You can roll each pair into a tight log, tie it with string or twine, and then let it burn. The tighter you roll it, the longer it’ll take to burn. That’s because you’re keeping the air from circulating through it as quickly. To make a jean roll, you’ll need a pair of jeans and a couple of feet of string. Here’s the way I found to be the easiest. Stretch the jeans out in front of you, with the legs closest to your body. Begin rolling one leg. Roll it as tight as you can, jellyroll style. Once you get to the crotch, take a section of string and tie it around the rolled leg to keep it in place. You’ll want the string to run across the long end of the roll rather than the short end. Now, repeat with the other leg. When both legs are secure, grab onto both sections. Slowly begin rolling the leg rolls up into the waist of the pants. It’ll be bulky, so you’ll have to keep pressure on it to keep it tight. The waist section should completely cover the individual leg rolls and wrap around it a couple of times. Once you’ve reached the top of the jeans, it’s best if you have some help to tie it. That way you can ensure it stays tightly wound. Wrap string all the way around it and secure tightly. Repeat in three more places. Now your jean logs are ready for the fireplace. Rolled Paper Logs Do you have a large supply of newspapers on hand? What about books, magazines, or a couple of phone books? This paper can all be used to create rolled paper logs to burn. You’ll need to stack up your paper before you roll it. You want your finished log to be about three inches in diameter, so you might need to experiment with how much you stack to see how thick your finished product turns out. As with the jeans, you’ll want to roll the paper as tightly as possible. It’ll take a while to get the first couple of logs rolled, but once you get the hang of it, the process will go more quickly. Once the paper is rolled, use string, twine, or rubber bands to hold it tightly. You don’t want it to unroll on you. Video first seen on New and Lost Crafts . Green Wood If you have access to green wood, you can cut it down and it’ll burn. Are there any shrubs, bushes, or trees in your yard that you could get to safely? When going this route, keep in mind that green wood burns differently than seasoned wood. It’s harder to start, and may require a propane torch instead of just a match. Unseasoned wood also puts more creosote into your chimney, so you’ll want to ensure you check the chimney frequently for any build up. If you notice build up, let your fire go out and clean the chimney before you use it again. You don’t want to start a chimney fire! An Emergency Tree We usually pick out one or two emergency trees at the start of each fire burning season. These are standing dead trees on the property that’ll be accessible by tractor even in the middle of winter. If our wood supply is ever compromised, we know that we can get a couple loads from those trees. If you have your own wooded land, you might consider leaving an emergency tree too. Twisted Straw Sticks You can take a page out of a Little House book and use the method Laura and Pa did in The Long Winter. When the Ingalls family ran out of wood to burn, they started twisting hay into long sticks. It was time consuming, but kept the family warm through the long winter. If you have a surplus of hay or straw, you can make your own sticks to burn. You’ll want to ensure the sticks are tightly wound so they burn longer. Broken Furniture and Wood Scraps Do you have any broken wood furniture around your homestead? How about wood scraps from building projects? Both can be burned. What other wood burning mistakes can you add? These are four common mistakes that people burning with wood make. Can you add others to the list? How do you best prepare for your wood burning season?   Lisa Tanner for Survivopedia. 7 total views, 7 views today",1
475,"Now that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers’ online data. States have other ideas. As on climate change, immigration and a host of other issues, some state legislatures may prove to be a counterweight to Washington by enacting new regulations to increase consumers’ privacy rights. Illinois legislators are considering a “right to know” bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates. Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers’ locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in   devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois  —   because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of   and   features to localize their effects. Congress is pushing to overturn regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration that limit the collection of data by broadband providers like ATT and Comcast. The Senate approved the rollback last week, and the House is expected to follow this week. Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation. Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction. California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees’ social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants. “More and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,” said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and   Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said. States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle. In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them. But federal blockage can create local opportunities. “What you’re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts  —   not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s consumer protection bureau. “So what’s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it’s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy. ” In Illinois, the “right to know” legislation recently cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, paving the way for a full vote sometime in the next few weeks. Technology companies and their trade organizations are lobbying fiercely against it. “I think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,” said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure. Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation. In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers. “Hiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service  —   that will be a real burden for small businesses,” he said. Illinois also has another dimension:   lawyers. Almost a decade ago the state passed a trailblazing law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, that regulates the collection of things like facial scans, voice data and thumbprints. This has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against Facebook, Google and others. Last year, lobbyists for Facebook failed in a push for an amendment that would have weakened the biometric law by exempting   technologies that are now commonly used on social media. In the interim, however, lawyers at Edelson PC, a     firm that has become notorious among tech companies for its prolific filing of privacy suits, have gone on offense with a lobbying campaign of their own. Firm lawyers have also helped found a new nonprofit group, the Digital Privacy Alliance, as an advocate for privacy legislation in Illinois and elsewhere. “We were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,” said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. “It’s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general. ”",0

477,"WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt on Friday to run the Environmental Protection Agency, putting a seasoned legal opponent of the agency at the helm of President Trump’s efforts to dismantle major regulations on climate change and clean water  —   and to cut the size and authority of the government’s environmental enforcer. Senators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E. P. A. ’s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency’s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from   states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him. Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general’s office is under order to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep. Democrats, environmental groups and even current E. P. A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt’s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate. Both opponents and supporters of Mr. Pruitt’s say he is well positioned to carry out Mr. Trump’s campaign trail promises to dismantle the agency and slash its ranks of employees. Mr. Trump vowed to “get rid” of the agency “in almost every form. ” A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors. Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E. P. A. regulations. Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships. “I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them  —   and shame on us if we didn’t,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. “Mr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a   and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E. P. A. ,” Mr. Carper said. “Like many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, ‘Did he mean it?’ With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it’s clear he did. ” For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt’s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president’s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E. P. A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting   power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell’s   state. Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about   global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules. “Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E. P. A. ,” Mr. McConnell said. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the   consequences of E. P. A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the  . ” Mr. McConnell added: “We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years. ” Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House’s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the   to   legal process of withdrawing the   climate rules and replacing them with looser, more   rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate   greenhouse gases in the first place. Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress’s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.",0
478,"Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “You can’t make this stuff up. ” So, so wrong. It turns out the subway cricket lady was a prank. The   subway riders? Flimflam. Even, it seems, that      New Yorker the Pizza Rat may have been schooled and rehearsed for the camera. Is no crazy thing sacred, or at least genuine? The subway cricket lady, for those not paying attention, was videotaped last week on the D train as she was supposedly trying to sell crickets and worms out of a bucket. As the story went, a group of teenagers bumped into her and she flew off the handle and dumped the crickets and worms into the train. “Straphangers Go Berserk After Woman Tosses Bugs in Subway Car,” The New York Post reported. The emergency brake was pulled  —   a truly useless maneuver, bringing the train to a dead stop on the Manhattan Bridge. The first reports of this were accompanied by a cellphone video of the chaos. Then another video surfaced and the   reporters Rafi Schwartz and Soraya Auger of Vox noticed that it was quite a polished bit of filmmaking. Through advanced interrogation techniques, they extracted an admission of responsibility from the woman who posted it. She declared herself to be the   and said she was engaged in performance art having something to do with homelessness. The bucket of bugs was knocked out of her hands by another member of her troupe. Who knows how many other passengers were part of the staging or just fated to be along for the ride. Eventually, the brakes were reset and the train moved off the bridge. On Tuesday, having been exposed, she was arrested on a charge of reckless endangerment by the police, who had previously been willing to let her slide. So actually, you can make this stuff up, and be believed. But why bother? The implausible is the daily bread of the subway, served without irony. Real events: Trysts. Preachers. Makeup artists. The “    ” acrobats. Buckets of dead crabs, as Gothamist reported, and a condom tied to a pole on the F train, apparently for weeks, and seemingly, we regret to say,  . All manner of live creatures: chickens, frogs, goldfish, cats, a monkey. And of course, microbes, by the kajillion. (The Central Intelligence Agency took it upon itself in 1966 to see how quickly germs would be propelled through the tunnels via the piston effect of moving trains. At strategic spots, the C. I. A. people dropped light bulbs filled with what they termed innocuous bacteria, then measured how far they traveled.) Then there is the snake guy. “He wasn’t talking at all,” Conor C. Walsh remembered. “He had an intern, a young kid helper, and a duffel bag filled with five or six snakes. ” It was Halloween night two years ago, and Mr. Walsh and some friends were on a train that was moseying to Williamsburg. At first, the man draped the snakes on an overhead handrail. Then he walked through the car with them. “Unless you really protested, he was putting them on people,” Mr. Walsh, 28, said. “There was a   woman shrieking and screaming. He wasn’t going to put it on her. ” Some of the passengers seemed thrilled about having a snake coiled around their bodies. “I don’t like them at all,” Mr. Walsh said. “It’s my one thing. I kept him away, at all times. I was just imagining his apartment, or his warehouse, wherever he kept them. ” Although the man did not speak, he appeared to be marketing the snakes. “He had business cards that he passed out,” Mr. Walsh said, “but no one was walking away with a snake. ” Mr. Walsh, who grew up in New York and teaches high school in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, is also a singer and guitarist with the indie band  . He has put subway exotica to excellent use in his music. “There are days when you hate the subways and days when you meet some awesome people,” he said. “I sat down next to this guy one time, and we got talking, so I asked him what he did. He said: ‘I’m a shaman. I’m an actual shaman. I help my clients speak to the spirits.’ He was a nice kid, 26. Had gone to Hampshire, that college in Massachusetts. ” Mr. Walsh turned his encounter with the young shaman into a brisk, fun pop tune, “Shaman,” which begins: “I met a shaman who grew up in Queens   On the D train his knees touching me. ” After all, there’s magical realism to spare.",0
479,"WASHINGTON  —   Known as a     prosecutor, Rod J. Rosenstein was expected to sail through Senate confirmation to be the Justice Department’s   . But that process has become enmeshed in the drama surrounding questions about President Trump’s campaign ties to Russia. Mr. Rosenstein faces the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday as the president’s nominee for deputy attorney general. In that post, he would oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, because Attorney General Jeff Sessions removed himself from any such cases after the disclosure last week that he had misled Congress about meeting twice with the Russian ambassador. Democrats who have otherwise expressed confidence in Mr. Rosenstein’s prosecutorial skills said they were skeptical that he  —   or anyone besides an independent outside counsel  —   would not be subject to political pressure while overseeing such an investigation. “Rosenstein has a good reputation as a career prosecutor, but this is going to test him, and I worry about the integrity of the Justice Department,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a telephone interview Monday. Through his office, Mr. Rosenstein declined to comment. The F. B. I. which is overseen by the Justice Department, is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. The House Intelligence Committee has also opened an inquiry into whether Russia tried to influence the election. Mr. Rosenstein, who received his law degree from Harvard, is nothing if not a survivor after nearly 12 years as the United States attorney for Maryland under both Republican and Democratic presidents. He was one of only three United States attorneys appointed by the administration of President George W. Bush to be kept in the job by President Barack Obama in 2009  —   and the only one to last all eight years of Mr. Obama’s administration. His supporters say he has been willing to take on politically charged cases throughout his career. Two decades ago, Mr. Rosenstein worked on Kenneth Starr’s independent counsel investigation into the Whitewater affair, earning three convictions related to President Bill Clinton’s business dealings in Arkansas. In a   leak case last year, Mr. Rosenstein extracted a guilty plea from James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, a retired   Marine general and a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had asked Mr. Rosenstein and another prosecutor to handle the investigation after accusations the Obama administration was behind leaks related to a cyberattack and drone strikes. Just last week, Mr. Rosenstein announced the indictments of seven Baltimore police officers on conspiracy and racketeering charges. “He has a reputation for being a straight shooter who plays it right down the middle, and those are important qualities for a deputy attorney general,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, who was the top aide to former Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates and is now in private practice in Washington at the Linklaters law firm. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as the acting attorney general five weeks ago after she refused to defend the initial version of his travel ban in court because she said she was uncertain it was legal. Mr. Leahy, the Vermont senator, said that her firing made the debate over Mr. Rosenstein’s nomination even more important, with “that kind of precedent” hanging over him. Douglas F. Gansler, a former Maryland attorney general, said on Monday, “Rod is about as apolitical a person as you can imagine, which is why he could survive eight years in a Democratic administration after being named by a Republican. ” “Would he stand up to the political winds of President Trump?” he said. “I’d think yes. ” The Justice Department said Monday that if Mr. Rosenstein was confirmed, he would oversee any investigations related not only to the Trump campaign, but also to the president’s transition after the Nov. 8 election. In announcing on Thursday that he would remove himself from such a case, Mr. Sessions had left open the possibility that he might still oversee matters related to the transition period. But in a letter to leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee late on Monday, he said that his recusal “would include any such matters,” as well. That question is important because Michael T. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month, admitted that he had contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, during the transition. Some Democrats have said that those contacts  —   which helped force Mr. Flynn’s resignation  —   might have been illegal. Mr. Sessions also spoke at least twice with Mr. Kislyak: once at the Republican National Convention in July, and again at his Senate office in September, two months before the election. When asked at his confirmation hearing in January about a news article about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, Mr. Sessions responded, “I didn’t have, did not have communications with the Russians. ” Democrats accused him of lying to the committee by not disclosing his conversations with the ambassador, and they called for the Justice Department to open a perjury investigation. In his letter on Monday, Mr. Sessions said that “my answer was correct,” because he said his conversations with the ambassador were not political in nature. In answering the question, Mr. Sessions wrote, “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian ambassador over the years, because the question did not ask about them. ” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, said he was satisfied with the attorney general’s explanation. “I appreciate Attorney General Sessions’s quick action to clear up confusion about his statement,” Mr. Grassley said Monday.",0
480,"LOS ANGELES  —     anthropomorphic food. Meryl Streep as a clueless opera singer. A furry, folksy Disney dragon. Bank robbers in   West Texas. It was a weekend of unusually   new offerings at North American theaters, and it worked out well for Hollywood  —   for the most part. As expected, “Suicide Squad” (Warner) led the box office pack for a second weekend, taking in an estimated $43. 8 million, for a new domestic total of $222. 9 million, according to comScore. But the film also   dropping 67 percent weekend to weekend, as its Rotten Tomatoes grade from critics caught up to it and the fanboy audience turned toward the   animated “Sausage Party. ” Backed by a crackerjack marketing campaign, “Sausage Party” (Sony) collected about $33. 6 million, beating the prerelease expectations of some box office analysts and proving once again that audiences respond to original concepts. “Sausage Party,” with character voices provided by Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig, was also relatively cheap: Sony and Annapurna Pictures split the $19 million in production expenses. “Pete’s Dragon” (Disney) was third. Ticket sales totaled $21. 5 million, a bit less than anticipated. This   remake charmed most critics, but its crowd appeal was limited. Disney said on Sunday that 33 percent of the   audience was under the age of 12. “Pete’s Dragon” cost about $65 million to make. Playing in less than half as many theaters, the Meryl Streep vehicle “Florence Foster Jenkins” (Paramount) began its run with $6. 6 million in ticket sales, on par with expectations for a period film aimed at older women. (Paramount said on Sunday that 97 percent of the audience was over the age of 25.) While Ms. Streep has lost some of her box office sizzle in recent years, she continues to be adored by critics, receiving strong enough reviews in this modestly budgeted film to spark early awards buzz. Also of note: “Hell or High Water” (Lionsgate and CBS Films) a $12 million Texas heist thriller that has received euphoric reviews and stars Jeff Bridges, began a slow,   rollout, arriving in 32 theaters and collecting $592, 000, for a hefty   average of $18, 500.",0
481,"Several health insurers will raise premiums by roughly 20 percent on plans sold through Obamacare exchanges. [The biggest Obamacare rate hikes will take place in Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, which will ask for premiums on average higher than 30 percent in 2018. In Maryland, the average premium from CareFirst will rise by at least 50 percent. Oregon, North Carolina, and Maine health insurers will raise premiums by 20 percent or higher.  The health insurers’ rate hikes reflect the continuing collapse of Obamacare, as many state Obamacare exchanges continue to experience insurers exiting the Obamacare exchanges. Insurers also remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s potential decision to discontinue subsidies for health insurers to lower the cost of premiums. Conservatives argue that the Obamacare subsidies amount to handouts to large health conglomerates. Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan, said, “It’s still a very volatile market. There are so many uncertainties. ” Notter argues that the individual health care market continues to experience turbulence through the uncertainty that comes out of D. C. Republicans, who passed a health care bill through the House, point to insurers’ rate hikes and withdrawals from Obamacare exchanges as fundamental problems with the Affordable Care Act. “The laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars,” a White House official said. Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) argues that Republicans’ attempt to repeal Obamacare, as well as President Trump’s threat to remove subsidies to health insurers, created the health insurance rate hikes. Kaine said, “These actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition. ” Kevin Lewis, the chief executive at Maine Community Health Options, said that its 19. 6 percent increase in 2018 arises from healthy people exiting the Obamacare markets. “It’s the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market,” Lewis said. “It’s a bit of a   prophecy. ” President Donald Trump, citing that two million Americans have withdrawn from their Obamacare plans since signing up in January, declared that Obamacare is in a “ . ” 2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare.

482,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama, dedicating the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, said it would tell an American story, one of “suffering and delight, one of fear, but also of hope, of wandering in the wilderness, and then seeing, out on the horizon, a glimmer of the Promised Land. ” Speaking to dignitaries and thousands of people watching from the National Mall, Mr. Obama said the museum would document the stories of Americans who are often overlooked in history books  —   “the president but also the slave, the industrialist but also the porter, the keeper of the status quo, but also the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo. ” On a day rich in symbolism, under a gray sky that seemed to capture the ambiguity of the black American experience, Mr. Obama warned that the museum would not be a panacea for the nation’s racial struggles, which, even today, inflame the streets of cities like Charlotte, N. C. “A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city,” he said. “It won’t eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind. ” But Mr. Obama said the museum’s exhibits would put those problems into a larger context, allowing people to see the progress as well as the shortcomings in American society. He said he hoped it would encourage a dialogue among Americans on difficult issues like the systemic racism in law enforcement or the violence toward police officers. “Hopefully,” the president said, “this museum can help us talk to each other, and more importantly listen to each other, and most importantly see each other. ” “Perhaps they can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of a demonstrator in Ferguson and Charlotte,” Mr. Obama said. And perhaps, he said, it could help a black visitor see the efforts of police officers who, “in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing. ” Acts of protest, Mr. Obama said, are acts of patriotism, whether it was sitting at a lunch counter in the South in the 1960s or wearing a   emblazoned with the words “I can’t breathe,” as Eric Garner, gasping facedown on a sidewalk in Staten Island, said before he died. Mr. Obama has articulated these themes before, most notably in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the protest march in Selma, Ala. But on Saturday, his tone was less anguished or exhortatory than it has been in the past. He was clearly rejoicing in the glorious history contained in this newest outpost of the Smithsonian Institution. “We’ve shown the world we can float like butterflies and sting like bees,” Mr. Obama said, not even needing to mention the author of that boast, Muhammad Ali, who died three months ago.   he said, can “rock like Jimi” and “stir the pot like Richard Pryor. ” “We’re not a burden on America or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America,” the president added. “We’re America. ” Mr. Obama officially opened the museum by ringing a large bell from an   black church in Virginia, in an echo of bells rung to mark the emancipation of the slaves. He spoke against the majestic bronze backdrop of the museum, a kind of inverted ziggurat not far from the Washington Monument. In its shadow, viewers were spread across the lawn and pressed against a fence, listening intently to the president. His speech was the centerpiece of a solemn, yet quietly jubilant, ceremony featuring the civil rights leader John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder, who joked of the museum, “I haven’t seen it yet, but I’m going to. ” Ms. LaBelle got a huge roar from the crowd when, at the end of her emotional rendition of the civil rights anthem “A Change Is Gonna Come,” she added the words, “Hillary Clinton. ” There was a panoply of dignitaries, including George W. Bush, who signed the legislation authorizing the building of the museum, and his wife, Laura, who spoke of her early brainstorming discussions with the museum’s director, Lonnie Bunch. Bill Clinton watched from the front row, sitting alongside Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson sat nearby. “This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the principles of liberty held thousands in chains,” Mr. Bush declared. “Even today, the journey towards justice is not compete. But this museum will inspire us to go farther and get there faster. ” The museum, Mr. Bush said, celebrated several of his heroes, including the musician Chuck Berry, the baseball player Willie Mays and the Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. spoke of the legacy of racism, enshrined in Jim Crow laws, and how the fight for justice flowed through  —   and was sometimes set back by  —   landmark court rulings, from the Dred Scott case to Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. To understand the real Dred Scott, Chief Justice Roberts said, one should visit this museum. Donna Sampson Rawlings, 59, of Ashton, Md. who watched the ceremony on a screen on the Mall, said the event brought back memories of her father, and of “all the people who weren’t here who did things to get us here. ” She said she had toured the museum last week during a special program. Many of the visitors were older, she said, and “I had to step back and think, ‘This is their lives. ’” “If you’re 80 years old, you went through so much of this,” she added. “Seeing it is, for them, emotional. It’s something they never thought they’d see. ” “These are the stories that we talk about that nobody knows,” she said. Johnnie Wilson, of Springfield, Va. said he had fought in Vietnam “for the nation’s rights, knowing that back home we didn’t have the rights. ” He said the museum compensated for what he believed was a sanitized version of history taught in schools. “Throughout the time we’ve been on these shores, we’ve made major contributions to America,” he said. “We’re really part of an American history that isn’t told like it should be in classrooms. ” Mr. Obama, who was given a sneak peek of the museum recently with his family, spoke during his speech of a stone slaver’s block on exhibit, marked only as the site of a speech by Andrew Jackson in 1830. It was, the president said, “a stone where day after day for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle, on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet. ” The museum, Mr. Obama said, would make visitors face uncomfortable truths. But it would also capture the essential greatness of the United States  —   the perpetual struggle to live up to its highest ideals. Mr. Obama spoke emotionally of his many flights on Marine One across the Mall, past the alabaster spire of the Washington Monument and the lighted figure of Abraham Lincoln, sheltered in his memorial. He said he had watched the museum rise from the ground and thought of the days when he and his family would return to visit it as private citizens. “We’ll walk away that much more in love with this country,” he said, “the only place on earth where this story could have unfolded. ”",0
483,"An organization partnered with   groups that calls itself the Revolutionary Love Project distributed an actual script with   talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess. [The script provides    language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. ”  It asks activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing President Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.  The script is entitled, “#NoBanNoWallNoRaids Talking Points for Congressional Townhalls. ” It ends with contact information for activists from two groups heavily financed by billionaire George Soros  —   Avideh Moussavian at the National Immigration Law Center and Deepa Iyer at the Center for Social Inclusion. Contacted by Breitbart News, Moussavian confirmed his group “contributed” to the script “in response to overwhelming concern and fear stemming from the January 27th executive order that sought to ban the entry of refugees and Muslims and in response to mounting questions from community members about how to express these concerns to policy makers. ” Despite Moussavian’s claims, Trump’s executive order did not seek to ban Muslims from entering the U. S. It temporarily halted the refugee program while the flawed security screening process could be reworked. The   script for activists is meant to aid a project driven by the George   MoveOn. org group declaring the week of February     —   the first congressional recess of the 115th Congress  —   to be “Resistance Recess. ” The project called on activists to show up at “elected officials’ events, town halls, and other public appearances to make it clear to those who represent us in Congress, as well as to the media, that tolerance of the Trump Administration’s hurtful policies is intolerable, that indifference or idleness is not acceptable, that complacency is politically toxic. ” A blast email from the Revolutionary Love Project urged supporters to use the talking points “script” to “voice your concern” when meeting last week with constituents during the Congressional recess. The actual script recommends that activists say the following in stages: Stage 1: Who You Are. My name is ______ and I’m a resident of _______. Add a description of your connection to the community. Stage 2: Your Concerns. I am particularly concerned about the Administration’s efforts to  target and criminalize immigrants, refugees and people entering our country from   countries. I want you as a representative of our district to understand the impact of Trump’s executive orders and to take action. The script provides talking points and urges activists to use the language to “buttress your concerns. ” The talking points deploy key words like “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia” as suggested descriptions of Trump’s temporary refugee halt as well as the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Here are some talking points provided: *Trump’s executive orders to deport undocumented immigrants, to punish   sanctuary cities for defending the Constitution, to ban people from seven   countries, and to shut the door on refugees all have one thing in common: they are rooted in hate, bigotry and a desire to instill fear rather than promote unity. We call this xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. *Each of these executive orders is based on the false premise that immigrants pose a threat to us. They are hateful attacks not only on those newly arriving or seeking entry into the U. S. but to those of us, including U. S. citizens, who have raised families here, paid taxes for years and who have made enormous sacrifices and contributions. *The policy changes called for in the executive orders are extremist, costly and ineffective, and they will not make us safer. They have wreaked havoc and confusion in airports across the globe and at home, in our schools, workplaces, and backyards. *We are witnessing a massive militarization of our deportation force, and a supersizing of interior and border patrol agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are occurring in homes and workplaces, and the climate of fear as a result of rumored and reported raids are paralyzing our communities. Parents are afraid to send their children to school. Pregnant mothers are afraid to get basic nutrition assistance and prenatal care. We are separating families, hurting our economy and targeting the most vulnerable, without accountability from our federal government that is causing this devastation. The script asks representatives to “forcefully condemn” Trump’s immigration and border security agendas and to “support legislation in Congress that would block implementation and nullify the effects of these orders and prevent any funding for them. ” The National Immigration Law Center, which is listed on the talking points memo, was party to a lawsuit last month that temporarily blocked Trump’s original executive order. The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society earmarked for general support. The second group listed on the talking points memo, the Center for Social Inclusion, is also the recipient of numerous Open Society grants. The Revolutionary Love Project, which distributed the script, is partnered with numerous   groups, including T’ruah and Trinity United Church of Christ, which was formerly led by Jeremiah Wright Jr. Barack Obama’s infamous radical pastor for nearly twenty years. The Project is partnered with the organizers of last month’s Women’s March. Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

484,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump’s latest meeting with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, went smoothly. They pledged cooperation on trade, investment and border security. And, joined by Ivanka Trump, they met with female executives and announced an initiative to assist women in business. In private talks, Mr. Trudeau was expected to welcome the prospect of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that could test his commitment to internationalist principles. _____ 2. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was greeted with higher approval ratings when he returned home from his weekend golf outing with Mr. Trump in Florida. But there was surprise in the United States as it became clear that the two leaders discussed their response to North Korea’s missile test in full view of diners at Mr. Trump’s    resort, with aides pointing the lights from their smartphones at briefing documents. North Korea claims its launch shows progress toward   capabilities. The National Security Council, normally the president’s main arm to develop foreign policy, is in turmoil from top to bottom. Michael Flynn was said to have resigned as national security adviser following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russia. _____ 3. On the homefront, Mr. Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, the financier Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed by the Senate. And Republicans are hitting a roadblock in their quest to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act: Constituents upset that there is no plan to replace it have made themselves heard at public meetings in California, Utah and Wisconsin. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who faced a frustrated crowd on Saturday. _____ 4. Inside Trump Tower, the president’s sons talked to The Times about pressing on with global deals  —   and rebutting waves of criticism over ethical concerns. “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric Trump said during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” _____ 5. More harrowing details about the suffering of civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo: Canisters of chlorine gas, a banned weapon, were dumped on residential areas at least eight times in the final weeks of the battle to retake the city from rebels, Human Rights Watch reported. And a separate analysis drawing on satellite images, security videos, social media and TV footage indicates that Russia, contrary to its repeated claims, bombed a major hospital in the city multiple times. _____ 6. A California dam’s spillway appears to have stabilized, but evacuation orders remain in place for more than 180, 000 people as state authorities try to make emergency repairs before more rains come. Emergency shelters filled with residents while workers and experts swarmed the Oroville Dam, the tallest in the United States. “The big fear, again, is that potential for catastrophic failure,” one official said. _____ 7. Modern goddesses ruled the Grammys: Adele and Beyoncé brought dramatic spectacles. The big story after the show, though, was the   of Beyoncé in the top categories. “It was #GrammysSoWhite come to life,” our critic writes. We rounded up the best and worst of the performances, and here’s the red carpet. _____ 8. The American College of Physicians offers a new way to take care of your lower back pain: Wait it out. Take some aspirin if you really need it. Concerned about the epidemic of opioid addiction, the group says patients should try exercise, acupuncture, massage or yoga before resorting to prescription drugs. _____ 9. The dairy industry wants us to call almond, soy and coconut milk   …     something else. Dairy farmers are calling on Congress to stop makers of increasingly popular   alternatives from labeling them yogurt, milk or cheese, saying consumers could mistakenly equate their nutritional profiles. Our reporter wonders: “What about other nondairy products with dairy names? Will milk of magnesia, cocoa butter, cream of wheat and peanut butter have to change their names as well?” _____ 10. Finally, a reminder you may not need: Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day. We’d like to draw your attention to one of our most popular articles ever: “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love. ” In our latest Modern Love podcast, the actor David Oyelowo reads “Seeing the World Through My Wife’s Eyes,” about a man whose spouse helps him cope when he loses his sight. And our “Committed” series explores the   history of wedding announcements in The Times, with updates on noteworthy couples, milestones like the first gay wedding announcements and some pretty amazing wedding fashions, like those big pouffy ’80s gowns. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

485,"On Monday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” host Katy Tur asked Senator Deb Fischer ( ) asked if she thought President Trump was heading down “a dangerous path” because Trump has avoided criticizing Vladimir Putin, Putin has killed journalists, and “Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and his distaste for any news that doesn’t agree with him here. ”  Tur asked, “Why  —   what is your sense of why this president is going above and beyond, bending over backwards, if you will, to stay away from criticizing the Russian president? And it’s almost  —   give him an excuse. As we know, there’s, since 2000, been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia who came out against the government there.

487,"The Los Angeles Times reported early Sunday morning that Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic leaders in the state legislature made $1 billion in side deals to ensure the passage of a   hike in the state gasoline tax last week. [The Times said:    …     Brown and legislative dealers promised nearly $1 billion for the pet projects of lawmakers who had been sitting on the fence before they were persuaded to vote for the bill. The funding “arrangements,” as Brown called them, helped the governor and legislators break a   Sacramento stalemate on transportation funding. Some legislators said the   taints the legislative process, but Brown defended the deals as justified, a moderate investment compared with the payoff of a bill that will generate $5. 2 billion annually in the first 10 years for road repairs, and billions more in future years. One of the more prominent deals was the one that secured the vote of State Sen. Anthony Canella ( ) who was the only Republican in either chamber to support the measure, which includes raised fees at the Department of Motor Vehicles. That side deal turns out to have been the costliest of all, amounting to $400 million in pork for “the extension of the Altamont Corridor Express, a commuter rail line between the Bay Area and Central Valley. ” Canella’s vote was crucial, because moderate State Sen. Steve Glazer ( ) opposed the gas tax, explaining in a statement published by the East Bay Times that it was unnecessary to raise taxes rather than   spending from the costly   rail project. Canella was unrepentant, telling the Los Angeles Times: “I got the things I asked for, so apparently I made the most compelling case. ” Despite the pork for his home district, Cannella seemed to realize that his vote would be unpopular, tweeting on April 6 that he was avoiding social media.

488,"MONTGOMERY, Ala.  —   Gov. Robert Bentley resigned Monday, his power and popularity diminished by a sex scandal that staggered the state, brought him to the brink of impeachment and prompted a series of criminal investigations. Ellen Brooks, a special prosecutor, said Mr. Bentley quit in connection with a plea agreement on two misdemeanor charges: failing to file a major contribution report and knowingly converting campaign contributions to personal use. He pleaded guilty Monday afternoon. It was a stunning downfall for the governor, a Republican who acknowledged in March 2016 that he had made sexually charged remarks to his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. “I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama’s governor,” Mr. Bentley said at the State Capitol. He did not mention the charges to which he pleaded guilty, or the deal with prosecutors that mandated his resignation. His exit from government and guilty pleas followed mounting calls for his resignation, especially after a report that was made public on Friday said he had fostered “an atmosphere of intimidation” and compelled state employees to help him cover up his relationship with Ms. Mason. Impeachment hearings  —   the first in Alabama in more than a century  —   began Monday morning, when the State House was consumed by rumors that the governor would soon quit. Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey succeeded Mr. Bentley. A former state treasurer, she is the second woman to hold the office. She is a graduate of Auburn University and was a high school teacher and a bank officer before working for the Legislature. “The Ivey administration will be open, it will be transparent and it will be honest,” Ms. Ivey said. Mr. Bentley, 74, repeatedly denied having a physical relationship with Ms. Mason and long insisted that he had not broken any laws, but he was a subject of multiple investigations, including reviews by the F. B. I. and the Alabama attorney general’s office. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission said it had probable cause to find that Mr. Bentley had committed felonies, and it asked a district attorney to consider prosecuting him. Two days later, a lawyer hired by the Alabama House of Representatives released a report portraying Mr. Bentley as deceitful and desperate before his relationship with Ms. Mason made him a punch line. The   report said Mr. Bentley had offered little cooperation to legislative investigators, and it alleged that the governor’s critics had been subjected to coercion, including harassing messages and the threat of prosecution. The report described how Mr. Bentley tried to use a member of his security detail to break up with Ms. Mason on his behalf and how he demanded that Ms. Mason be allowed to travel in official vehicles after she left the state’s payroll. It also explored Mr. Bentley’s efforts to keep audio recordings of suggestive conversations with Ms. Mason from the public. In one such conversation, which rippled across the internet last year, the governor described embracing Ms. Mason and placing his hands on her breasts. By the weekend, legislative leaders had demanded that the governor quit, echoing a faction of    members in his own party who spent months vocally opposing him. On Sunday night, the steering committee of the Alabama Republican Party made a similar call. And by sunset Monday, Mr. Bentley was out of power. In court documents, the Alabama attorney general’s office said Mr. Bentley had failed to disclose a $50, 000 personal loan to his campaign account. The office also said Mr. Bentley had allowed nearly $9, 000 of campaign money to be used for Ms. Mason’s lawyers. Mr. Bentley was sentenced to a suspended jail term, fined $7, 000, placed on probation and ordered to complete community service. In an email on Monday, Ms. Mason declined to comment. Yet until Mr. Bentley’s court appearance, it was unclear that he would actually abandon the job to which he was easily   in 2014. Hours before the special counsel’s report became public on Friday, Mr. Bentley repeated his familiar pledge not to resign, and he pleaded for an end to the debate that stemmed from his personal conduct. “The people of this state have never asked to be told of or shown the intimate and embarrassing details of my personal life and my personal struggles,” the governor said outside the Capitol. “Those who are taking pleasure in humiliating and in shaming me, shaming my family, shaming my friends, well, I really don’t understand why they want to do that. ” Within days, Mr. Bentley resigned. The decision punctuated a sordid drama that exploded last year, prompting renewed scrutiny of his 2015 divorce from Dianne Bentley, his wife of 50 years. Mr. Bentley’s complaints and apologies over more than a year did little to quell public outrage in Alabama, where he had cultivated a reputation as an ethically sound public official. Now, he is the first Alabama governor to quit since 1837, when Clement Comer Clay left Montgomery to become a United States senator. (In 1993, Guy Hunt was automatically removed from office after being convicted of an ethics charge he was later pardoned.) Mr. Bentley’s resignation is the third major transfer of power in Alabama government since June, when the House speaker, Michael G. Hubbard, was convicted of ethics charges and forced from office. Later in the year, Chief Justice Roy S. Moore was suspended for the balance of his term for violating judicial ethics standards. Mr. Bentley, a dermatologist, was a legislative backbencher until he stunned Alabama with his successful campaign for governor in 2010. In the early months of his tenure, he was widely praised for his response to a tornado outbreak that devastated much of the state. His policy legacy, at least among many Republicans, will be mixed. He opposed   marriage and, within months of taking office, approved what was then one of the country’s most aggressive immigration laws. But he also called for higher taxes and, in 2015, surprised many people when he unilaterally ordered four Confederate flags lowered on the grounds of the State Capitol. He also refused to endorse Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign. But Mr. Bentley’s personal conduct placed some of the greatest stress on his ties to members of his own party, and those conflicts worsened as he clung to power. “It’s sad watching anyone fall,” State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican, said Monday. “I hate that it all happened, but I’m thankful that the governor stepped aside. We can begin to put this behind us. ”",0
489,"The FBI arrested the wife of Omar Mateen, the jihadi responsible for a massacre at Orlando’s Pulse night club last year, on Monday morning in San Francisco on charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting the attempted provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization. [Salman will make a court appearance on Tuesday, her lawyer told ABC News. She was indicted in Tampa, Florida and is expected to relocate there to face charges in the case.  Mateen killed 49 people at an Orlando, Florida nightclub on June 12, 2016 and left more than 50 others injured. During the prolonged attack on the Pulse nightclub, Mateen called    pledged allegiance to ISIS and spoke of the Boston Marathon Islamic terrorist bombers. Mateen was eventually shot and killed in a standoff with law enforcement. After the attack, reports revealed allegations that Mateen attended the Islamic Center Fort Pierce for 13 years or more. Salman had told the Washington Post that her husband “wasn’t very religious. ” A Florida gun shop owner had also alerted the FBI after a suspicious man came in inquiring about body armor, which the owner refused to sell it to him. The FBI had investigated Mateen in the past as a potential terrorist. Media reports initially put heavy emphasis on reporting that Mateen may have been mentally ill or harbored repressed homosexual tendencies. The FBI found no evidence of the latter, instead finding evidence he may have had a romantic relationship with a woman other than his wife. Authorities eventually released the seventeen pages of    transcripts from Mateen’s phone call on the night of the massacre, which revealed that he ranted about America’s fight against the Islamic State. Breitbart News previously reported on these transcripts and specific motives Mateen spelled out in his    rant. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0

492,"Can nuclear war break out on the Korean Peninsula? 02.11.2016 Print version Font Size Does China support Pyongyang? Can the Chinese intervene in a possible conflict between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States? Senior officer at the Center for Korean Studies at the Institute of the Far East, Yevgeny Kim, gave an interview to Pravda.Ru, in which we spoke about North Korea's nuclear program and the possibility of the denuclearization of South-East Asia. ""North Korea is a closed and little known country in many ways. Yet, who raised the question of a nuclear threat? After all, there are American atomic bombs in South Korea."" ""China has been involved in this actively during the recent years, but one should not attach much importance to it. The mandate of the six-party talks was about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The question is not only about the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea . One should remove US nuclear bombs from South Korea and exclude a possibility for any type of nuclear weapons to appear on the Korean Peninsula on the whole. ""US nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear weapons, US aircraft carriers with nuclear weapons and US aircraft with nuclear weapons violate the regime of the nuclear-free zone in South Korea. Look at the Goa Declaration that was signed by the leaders of Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa. There are more than one hundred articles in this lengthy declaration, but it contains no word about the North Korean nuclear issue.""Last year's BRICS declaration did not mention anything about the the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the leaders of the five countries do not believe that North Korea is guilty of this problem."" ""Vladimir Putin said once that no one will touch a country if this country has a nuclear bomb. If it does not have a nuclear bomb, this country may experience the fate of Libya. What is Russia's stance on North Korea? Does Russia recognize the right of North Korea to have a nuclear bomb?"" ""The Americans would have shipped air defense systems to South Korea regardless of what kind of weapons North Korea would have had - nuclear or not. Russia is one of the great powers that has nuclear weapons, but Russia is not interested in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Of course, Russia would not like to see the emergence of new nuclear powers in the world. ""At the same time, Russia understands why other countries have nuclear weapons. Russia always says that all countries should proceed from the interests of equal security. Why should the USA be worried about the presence of nuclear weapons in North Korea? North Korea cannot attack the USA. Even if North Korea has launched missiles into space , it does not mean that those missiles can carry nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons have to be delivered to the territory of another state, and a missile has to reenter the atmosphere, where plasma can destroy it, but the missile has to remain guidable in such conditions to deliver its nuclear weapons to the target. North Korea does not have the technology."" ""Why does China keep silence?"" ""China understands the reason, for which North Korea has to develop its nuclear weapons. The Chinese realize that the Americans deploy air defense complexes to contain China and Russia, not North Korea. The Americans do not even hide the fact that they have another nuclear warhead to be delivered to Germany. Nowadays, one can test and further improve nuclear weapons without a physical explosion, and North Korea would need to switch to methods of mathematical analysis."" ""What will determine the economic development of North Korea - Sangun or reforms?"" ""Reforms, definitely. Sangun - the policy of the supremacy of the army - appeared in the mid-1990s, when the country was in dire straits. The country was forced to unite as a military camp and create the mobilization economy. Sangun made it possible to overcome a very difficult period in the history of North Korea, and the country continued its development, where rigid military control was not required. Now they conduct reforms."" ""Do you think a nuclear war may break out on the Korean Peninsula?"" ""No, a nuclear war will not break out on the Korean peninsula, as North Korea will not use military weapons first. The Americans have a theory of pre-emptive nuclear strike on North Korea, and Russia too, by the way. North Korea does not have such a theory.""

493,"Antidoping officials from at least 10 nations and 20 athlete groups are preparing the extraordinary step of requesting that the entire Russian delegation be barred from the Summer Olympics over allegations of a   doping program, according to email correspondence obtained by The New York Times. The antidoping officials and athletes were expected to pressure Olympic leaders on the matter as soon as Monday  —   less than three weeks before the opening ceremony in Rio. They were waiting for the results of an investigation into claims published in The Times of a   doping program conducted by Russian officials at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia’s former antidoping lab director, told The Times in May that he followed government orders to cover up the widespread use of   drugs by dozens of Russian Olympians at the Sochi Games. At least 15 of them won medals, he said. Russian officials have dismissed allegations of a   doping program as a Western conspiracy intended to smear Russia. The country’s track and field team has already been barred from the Rio Games for doping violations calls for sanctions against Russian athletes in every sport would be unprecedented and would likely escalate the geopolitical debate. At least 10 national antidoping organizations  —   including those in the United States, Germany, Spain, Japan, Switzerland and Canada  —   and more than 20 athlete groups representing Olympians from around the world have banded together as they anticipate validation of Dr. Rodchenkov’s claims. The chief executive of the Institute of National   Organizations, a trade group to which dozens of nations’ antidoping agencies belong, urged all members to sign on to the request on Friday, according to an email reviewed by The Times. “It seems very likely that the Report will confirm what will be one of the biggest doping scandals in history, implicating the Russian Government in a massive conspiracy against the clean athletes of the world,” wrote Joseph de Pencier, the chief executive of the national antidoping trade association. “This will be a ‘watershed moment’ for clean sport. ” In an interview on Saturday, Travis Tygart, head of the United States   Agency, said: “We’re not asking for the worst, and obviously we hope there’s no doping going on by states. But if we’re not preparing for all potential outcomes, then we’re not fulfilling our promise to clean athletes. ” Reuters first reported on Saturday that United States and Canadian antidoping officials were planning to call for a wider ban of Russian athletes at the Rio Games. Mr. Tygart and other antidoping officials said they had not seen the report, which was commissioned by the World   Agency and prepared by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren. It is expected to be released on Monday morning in Toronto. Mr. McLaren has indicated that his inquiry will prove true what Dr. Rodchenkov told The Times last spring. Last month, Mr. McLaren delivered a preliminary report to global track and field officials as they were scrutinizing Russia he called Dr. Rodchenkov’s detailed account of swapping out   urine at Sochi with the help of Russia’s intelligence service “credible and verifiable,” adding that he had evidence to confirm that “the ministry of sport was involved in instructing the laboratory to not report positive sample results. ” After that report, track and field’s governing body barred Russian athletes from the Games, leaving a “narrow crack in the door” for Russian athletes who had been subjected to rigorous   outside Russia to petition to compete in Rio, but under a neutral flag. So far, two Russian athletes have been given dispensation. One of them, Yuliya Stepanova, fled Russia in 2014 after alleging widespread doping. President Vladimir V. Putin has called her a “Judas” for betraying the country. “If McLaren produces clear, convincing, irrefutable evidence that there has been systemic   doping in Russian sport,” said Paul Melia, Canada’s top antidoping official, “the appropriate sanction would be for the I. O. C. to ban the Russian Olympic Committee from taking a team to Rio. ” Anticipating confirmation of Dr. Rodchenkov’s account, the group of dozens of antidoping officials are considering addressing Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and the organization’s executive board members. They are preparing to request that the ban applied to Russia’s track and field athletes be applied across sports, with opportunities for athletes to appeal and possibly be given permission to compete under a neutral flag. Since Dr. Rodchenkov outlined an elaborate doping scheme at the Sochi Games, the I. O. C. has repeatedly called for “the right balance between collective responsibility and individual justice. ” It is unclear if Mr. Bach would be persuaded by the antidoping organizations’ request to bar the entire Russian delegation. In May Mr. Bach said he would apply a “ ” policy and would not rule out bans against Russia across entire sports, like track and field. But last month he defended the Russian Olympic Committee, distancing the organization from the sports ministry. Dr. Rodchenkov, however, said he took direct orders from Russia’s deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, who is a member of Russia’s Olympic Committee. United States lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate have expressed concern about Dr. Rodhchenkov’s allegations. Last month, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said the scandal called into question the “strength and credibility” of the antidoping system. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce echoed that this month, urging Mr. Bach to seize “crucial and timely opportunities” to clean up global sports. “The failure to do so is simply irresponsible, and we will not remain silent,” the lawmakers wrote. Both the Senate and House committees have United States government jurisdiction over international sports, and the United States has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the World   Agency since the early 2000s. Russia’s sports ministry has admitted to doping problems in recent months but denied government involvement. In an interview with The Times in Moscow this month, Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister, diminished the power of Mr. McLaren’s commission and WADA, which have the ability to make recommendations such as the ones the antidoping officials and athletes are prepared to do. The I. O. C. and sports federations have ultimate authority over who competes at the Games. “Recommendations?” Mr. Mutko said. “It’s about the decisions. With respect to the commission, they do not determine the fate of world sport. ”",0

495,"Print [Ed. – Videos are starting to come out, like the one here . Reportedly, it took 40 police officers to gain control of the situation.] An Israeli speaker’s talk at a London college campus scheduled for this week was canceled on Wednesday. Why? Because, according to the cancelation notice sent by the student union, “there had been controversy” when he spoke at the campus two years prior, and the hosting organization failed to disclose that when the room was booked for the talk. After cries of suppression of speech and vehement protests, the university stepped in and “un”canceled the talk. Hen Mazzig’s talk at University College, London, was reinstated. It would take place, as scheduled, on Thursday evening, Oct. 27. The response by the anti-Israel mob was swift and the attack was vicious. A protest was called. Outside the room where Mazzig was scheduled to speak, livid demonstrators screamed for murder and the end of Israel. “Intifada, Intifada!” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” They barred the entrance to the talk while pummeling the doors and windows, leering malevolently. Two thugs yanked open a window, hurling themselves into the room, launching several students inside into panic attacks. A woman inside kept repeating: “This is like the Warsaw Ghetto!”",1
496,"ST. PAUL  —   A dashiki. A   trench coat. A sequined slip dress. A velvet blazer. Shirts, scarves and necklaces. Football jerseys, neckties, boas and silk robes. Hair dye and wigs. Nail polish and eye shadow and lipstick. Purple popped up in all sorts of places at the Xcel Energy Center here Thursday night, on Prince loyalists who had come from all over the city and all over the world for “The Official Prince Tribute Concert,” envisioned by his estate as a grand celebration of the legacy of a transformative rock and pop icon, who died April 21 of an accidental overdose of painkillers. Here, just next to Minneapolis, the city he honed his skills in and never strayed far from  —   his residential and recording complex, Paisley Park, is in nearby Chanhassen and is being converted into a museum  —   he is a god, and also a local kid done good. He is so much a part of the area’s fabric that it made utter sense that almost everyone in the   crowd of 17, 000 was keen to show off a little bit of inner Prince. That strong sense of ownership also highlighted the tension that underscored this decidedly uneven concert, and eventually almost undermined it  —   between Prince as a local hero and Prince as a global superstar. Judging by the execution of the concert, hometown Prince was the clear victor, or at least the more achievable inspiration. For almost five hours, the New Power Generation  —   one of Prince’s   backing bands  —   held steady court while several Prince collaborators known best to intimates and committed fans, and a handful of more widely known performers, including Stevie Wonder and Chaka Khan, celebrated Prince with covers of his songs. But when this concert was originally announced in July, it was scheduled for U. S. Bank Stadium, a football arena three times the size of the Xcel Energy Center. It also promised to emphasize Prince’s vast influence in the pop mainstream with performances by more contemporary stars like Christina Aguilera and John Mayer. But both of them withdrew from the downsized show this week under dubious circumstances. What remained was haphazard and inconsistent, a concert that told no coherent story about Prince apart from the fact that he was widely admired and almost impossible to emulate. Some gamely tried: Luke James, whose falsetto on “Do Me, Baby” attracted the first lusty shrieks of the night, and Bilal, the most impressive male singer here not named Stevie, who woke up   of the way through “The Beautiful Ones” and kept putting his limber voice to work through “If I Was Your Girlfriend” (though his performance couldn’t hold a candle to his riveting Prince tribute at the BET Awards in June). A pair of vocally ambitious young female soul singers, Tori Kelly and Jessie J, tried for similar energy. There is something tepid about Ms. Kelly’s brilliance  —   it’s familiar in shape but has no flash. And Jessie J is all pyrotechnics and no depth. Neither fared well here. Ms. Kelly’s “Let’s Get Crazy” was stagnant, and she wilted on “Take Me With U,” a duet with Mr. Wonder. The Portuguese fado singer Ana Moura played a perplexing set, including a version of “Little Red Corvette” that overlooked many of the words. Early in the night came a baffling appearance by Nicole Scherzinger, former lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, though it was less arbitrary than the repeated bits throughout the concert of Doug E. Fresh, the 1980s   beatboxer who had little in common with anyone else onstage. Even Chaka Khan felt unmoored, singing her own “Sweet Thing” and Prince’s “1999” with the same misty approach. Everyone’s set was brief  —   sometimes mercifully, often frustratingly. The show opened with two excellent Minneapolis stalwart bands: Mint Condition, inheritors of the Prince sound, and Morris Day  the Time, Prince collaborators and antagonists (who were to perform a   show at the storied Minneapolis club First Avenue later in the night). Both were gone too soon. Much of the heavy lifting fell to elders: Mr. Wonder, wearing a purple shirt and a purple kerchief in his blazer, who performed a gobsmacking version of Donny Hathaway’s “Someday We’ll All Be Free,” and later was visibly weeping during the “Purple Rain” encore. And the extremely spry André Cymone, a teenage friend and bandmate of Prince’s who was the most visible performer here, with strong versions of “Uptown,” “Controversy” and “The Ladder,” a duet with Cassandra O’Neal. (His guitar playing was much louder and more dexterous than his singing, though.) Mr. Cymone was one of several standouts from Prince’s extended orbit  —   others included Judith Hill (on “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore? ”) Liv Warfield (on “Hot Thing”) and Saeeda Wright (on “7”)  —   performers who reinforced the image of Prince as progenitor of a whole city’s worth of sounds. Even though the gaps between these moments and the rest of the show were large, the concert had a steady consistency throughout  —   onstage, Minneapolis was claiming its son, and in the audience, locals were grieving the loss of a neighbor.",0
497,"Print version Font Size The hypersonic aircraft , known as ""article 4202"" or ""15U71"" was successfully tested on October 25 for the first time. All avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system of the vehicle are entirely of Russian production.The weapon is capable of speeding up to 15 Max, or 7 km/sec. The vehicle was designed to be installed at prospective intercontinental ballistic missiles, instead of conventional warheads. The ""4202"" vehicle starts working at an altitude of about 100 km and flies to the target at the speed of 5-7 km/s. Before entering dense layers of the atmosphere, directly above the target, the hypersonic aircraft performs a complex maneuver that makes it difficult to interception by missile defense systems of the enemy . Noteworthy, the project of hypersonic warheads called ""Albatross"" appeared in the USSR in the mid-1980s, as a response to USA's attempts to create a missile defense system within the concept of ""star wars."" However, due to the technical difficulties, the project was shut down. In the mid-1990s, the Scientific and Production Association (NPO) resumed the development of the new weapon under the number ""4202.""According to sources at Roscosmos state corporation, the successful tests of the new hypersonic aircraft were made possible with the help of the intensive import substitution program. For instance, Russian engineers had to get rid of the control system, previously manufactured by Ukrainian company Hartron. The successfully implemented program provided an opportunity to resume the tests. As a result, all the avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system now completely consist of Russian components.The Russian Army is to receive new hypersonic weapons by 2020 . The development of high-speed anti-aircraft missiles has made it possible to intercept and destroy any modern aircraft or missile at any altitude. The way out is to create the aircraft capable of flying faster than interceptor missiles.For this particular reason, major powers of the world, such as the USA, Russia and China, rushed to develop hypersonic flight vehicles of different types and purposes. China, for example, tested the hypersonic WU-14 glider on 9 January 2015. The Chinese aircraft is launched into outer space with the help of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Then, the vehicle develops the speed of 10M, that is, more than 12,300 km/h, and dives onto the target. State-of-the-art air defense systems are unable to detect and intercept a target flying at this speed. China has thus become the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, which has the technology of hypersonic vehicles for both nuclear and conventional weapons. In fact, the Chinese have created a warhead with control surfaces that can maneuver in flight thus becoming practically invulnerable. However, this vehicle does not have its own engine, so the Chinese creation has become another weapon for ""the poorest."" Russia currently works on different types of hypersonic scramjet missiles, which can be launched from land, ships or aircraft.Pravda.Ru requested an expert opinion from chief editor of ""Arms Export"" magazine, Andrey Frolov.""How competitive is Russia in the development of hypersonic aircraft?"" ""Russia is at the forefront. This is not the first test, I think that in the near future these systems will be passed into service at the army. The Americans do not have such weapons yet, the Chinese are in the development process.""""Are there any other details available?"" ""This is a secret subject. We know that such weapons have been created - and this is a lot to know already."" Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Five types of Russian weapons which USA are afraid of",1
498,"On Jan. 4, 11 years and 26 days after I walked out of an animal shelter in New Jersey with a little white and brown dog attached to the end of a   leash, she died. On this day, an undiagnosed tumor pressed down on Emily’s brain and told her that she needed to escape, which made her usually soft, cuddly and often napping body go wild, endangering herself and me. The humane thing to do was put her down. I don’t think anything could have prepared me for that moment, or the searing grief that followed. But if I could go back in time to console myself, I would tell myself these six things: Most people will say the wrong thing. They will talk about dogs they knew and loved and put down, too, or, if they haven’t walked through this long, lonely tunnel yet, about how they can’t possibly imagine losing their very alive pet, which reminds you that yours is dead. They will also ask how old she was, and when you say 15, they will say, “Well, it was a good long life,” as if the ending of it would be less painful because of how long you were together. They may tell you other dog death stories, too, like the one about the dog who was so excited to be home from vacation that he bolted out of the car and was immediately run over while the whole family watched  —   stories that imply it could have been worse. They will shove shelter listings for other Jack Russell terriers at you, as if another dog could slip into that perfect little spot left by your beloved     pet. Guilt overwhelms. I still tell myself that I killed Emily, despite the veterinarian telling me, after her body had been taken away, while I gripped both a counter and a vet tech to keep from collapsing, that all four of her paws had been bloodied as she had clawed at the floor, the door and the ground during her manic and desperate attempt to get away from my home. There is guilt, too, over the relief of no longer having to take care of a dog who was on multiple medications and who had arthritis, two defective heart valves and pulmonary hypertension. You will become unmoored. I adopted Emily soon after I became a freelance writer, and I wrote three books with her by my side. She was the metronome to my life. With her gone, I floated through a space she no longer occupied but haunted with every little white hair found on my blankets, on the floor, in my shoes. Once, in the first week following her death, I came up from the basement and looked at the spot where she would usually be waiting. I called for her with the foolish notion that she’d appear at the top of the stairs. But of course, no: just another sledgehammer reminder that she was really gone. Grief is exhausting. Last fall, I ran two marathons and an ultramarathon. After Emily died, I couldn’t drag myself through three miles, not to mention find the energy to get out of bed, put on clothes that were not my pajamas and shower at regular intervals. I pushed off assignments because the idea of putting my fingers to the keyboard was inconceivable when Emily wasn’t sleeping on her bed in the corner of my office. These were wretched,   days, surrounded by a deafening silence. I went back into therapy after she died and was told I was depressed, which wasn’t surprising, as I had started to slip into bed at 8:30 p. m. and not get up until half a day later. Losing a companion and your routine all at once, especially if you’re single like me, could throw anyone into a tailspin. It will get better. You won’t want to hear it, or believe it, because the pain is so suffocating. It does ease, though, almost without you noticing it. But still, it slaps back. This may happen at predictable moments, such as when you decide to sell her crate, and sometimes not. Soon after Emily died, I got on a plane and went to Florida to bake out the pain with   poolside sessions punctuated by midday drinks. It worked, somewhat, but on my last night there, my face cracked open at the World of Disney store when I saw a mug with the character Stitch that said “brave” on one side and “loyal” on the other. Only the cashier noticed that I paid with tears and snot running down my face. I then ran out of the store to stare at a lake. These days, I get up, I brush my teeth, I write, I run. I smile now and laugh sometimes. The pain still catches me, though, and I can now more clearly see why: I loved that dog, and in giving a scared, abused, imperfect Emily a home, she loved me back, and together our lives both bloomed. The loss of that joy is why the pain is so acute  —   and why, at some point in the maybe not so distant future, I’ll go back to that animal shelter with a   leash, and do it all over again.",0
499,"Soon 15 NATO Nations Which Do Not Border Russia Will Have Troops on the Russian Border Why does Luxembourg need to have troops stationed a hundred miles from Russia's second city? From the news : More Nato members have pledged to contribute to four battalions stationed in Poland and the Baltic states as the military alliance continues to build its presence on its eastern flank, Nato's secretary general said on October 26. Albania , Italy , Poland and Slovenia will contribute to the Canada -led battalion in Latvia. Belgium , Croatia , France , Luxembourg , Netherlands and Norway will contribute to Germany -led battalion in Lithuania. Denmark and France will strengthen the UK -led battalion in Estonia, while Romania and the UK will add weight to the US -led battalion in Poland. In other words very soon 15 NATO nations (bolded) which do not share a border with Russia will have troops stationed abroad, on the Russian border. Additionally Poland and Norway which share a short border with Russia will also station troops abroad in Lithuania and Latvia. In total a coalition of 20 NATO nations will be parked in the Baltics in a way that encircles the Russian Kaliningrad exclave and puts a portion of the NATO troops just 100 miles from Saint Petersburg -- Russia's second city and historic capital. -- A city where some 1 million civilians were starved to death during the WWII siege put up by Germany which is now returned to the region. Of the 20 NATO nations now on Russia's vulnerable northwestern flank Germany, Italy amd Romania famously invaded it in the 1940s causing 25 million deaths , including 15 million deaths of civilians and prisoners of war . The Russians will also remember that with the German invaders came quisling troops from a number of other nations now again on its borders. The French came with SS Charlemagne, the Danish and Norwegians with SS Viking and Nordland, the Dutch with SS Nederland, the Croats with the 369th Regiment, the Belgians with SS Wallonien and Flandern. In the alternate reality inhabited by western functionaries Russia is about to invade the Baltics neccesitating the build-up there, which is to include a permanent presence of 4,000 troops backed up by a 'rapid reaction force' of 40,000 . On the other hand, c ombined NATO militaries are about 4 times the size the Russian military. Even without counting the US and Canada, the European NATO countries alone have 3 times the population of Russia and 10 times its GDP. Additionally Russia did not do anything to grab the Baltic countries whether before they joined NATO in 2004 or since. -- This despite the long-standing mistreatment of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia actually being worse in the 1990s than today. -- And certainly there are no Russian troops of the border of Albania, UK, Canada or Germany. So really, is this a defensive deployment, or a move to intimidate and dominate Russia by a far richer, and more powerful bloc?  ",1
